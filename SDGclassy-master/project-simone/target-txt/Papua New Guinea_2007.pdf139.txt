2.   Current Scene, 2007-2009: At the macro-level, Papua New Guinea has made much progress towards
     arresting the decline in service delivery, political and economic stability and economic growth through
     wealth creation. However, it has yet to reach maturity in many aspects of government in order to
     ensure that systems are run on standard operating procedures (SOPs), which will lead to robust
     institutional development, without undue political intervention and speed up outcomes. Therefore,
     our challenges remain multifaceted and confront both process management issues and innovation
     endeavours to new emerging issues. At the micro-level, particularly in regard to service delivery and
     infrastructure provision, the gains in macro-management have not trickled down. This is the real
      challenge  for contemporary PNG
