2.10 Energy
According to The World Bank Report (2011) on 'Vulnerability to Higher Oil Prices' (Kojima, 2011), the
vulnerability1 of the Mauritian economy to oil price increased from 3.9 in 2003 to 8.9 in 2008, which is
above the mean vulnerability parameter of 3.8 for African economies. Energy in the Republic of
Mauritius is still met by imported fossil fuels. For instance, in 2009 82.5% of the total primary energy
requirement was imported. Figure 3.1 shows the average import price of energy sources during the
period 2001-2010. The  challenge  is to increase the share of renewable energy and explore other
sources of energy in the energy mix
