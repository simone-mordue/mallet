Mainstreaming issues facing people living with disabilities is a great  challenge  but also a crucial
component of poverty reduction. Through the Department of Social Welfare and the Fiji National Council
for Disabled Persons, the Government adopted the Fiji National Disability Policy (FNDP) in November
2008. Identified outputs of the policy will enable the advancement of programmes, development of
strategies and identification of activities to improve and progress the status and well being of people living
with disabilities. The first ever national count of people living with disabilities has been completed and
more than 10,000 have been recorded to live with some form of disability, mental, physical or both. The
results of the count will enable the development of focused programmes and targeted intervention to be
designed to reduce the vulnerability of people with disabilities
