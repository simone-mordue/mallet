The immediate  challenge  is to regain lost credibility and focus on restoring its traditional relationships by
advocating Fiji's interests in regional and international institutions such as Pacific Islands Forum (PIF)
States, the Commonwealth, the Africa, Caribbean & Pacific (ACP) Group, the EU, and the United Nations
Global economic conditions and the erosion of the preferences and other constraints for trade and market
access restrictions due to non-tariff barriers applied by many countries have been key challenges in the
areas of trade and investments. Adverse advisories and travel bans on those assisting with rebuilding Fiji
have also had very negative implications. Trade agreements will be treated with caution to consider first
the increasing costs of participation that at times supersedes the potential benefits. However, limited
negotiating capacity will be efficiently and effectively invested in areas where there are market access and
strategic economic gains to be made. The costs of participation are a result of multiple rules, obligations,
technical standards and requirements for market entry. Despite these, trade will be facilitated through
quarantine protocols and customs, ports and immigration agencies will be strengthened
