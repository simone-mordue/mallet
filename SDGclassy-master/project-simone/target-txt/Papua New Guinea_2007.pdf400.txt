     21.3 Law and Order: The law and order problem poses a great challenge to the development and
            implementation of the long-term plan. Low literacy rates, unemployment and social
            displacements have fuelled law and order problems. In an attempt to escape impoverished rural
            areas, people are migrating to urban centres where unemployment rates are very high and living
            conditions unbearable. This situation has created an immense  challenge  for law and order
            agencies. Furthermore, the cultivation, marketing and abuse of drugs are on the increase among
            young people. Papua New Guinea's law and order situation requires immediate action so that all
            other potential socioeconomic gains are not jeopardised. Improving the law and order situation
            is essential to laying the foundations for socioeconomic growth and establishing investor
            confidence. Adequate budgetary allocations to the Royal Papua New Guinea Constabulary
            (RPNGC) and to the broader law and justice sector is necessary to combat law and order
            problems
