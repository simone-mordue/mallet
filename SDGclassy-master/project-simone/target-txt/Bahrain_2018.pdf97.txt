4.3 The environmental challenge
Sustainability, in its most comprehensive form, is of the utmost importance to the
Kingdom of Bahrain. At the core of sustainable development lies environmental
sustainability, which is also particularly important to Bahrain due to the serious
environmental challenges it is facing due to the country's geographical
characteristics. Bahrain consists of a group of small desert islands that suffer from
water scarcity and insufficient agricultural lands. It is under threat from the effects
of climate change, in addition to the subsequent impact of human pressures on the
environment, resulting from large urban expansion, change in lifestyles, and
                                          31

population growth. In this regard, the environmental challenge Bahrain faces is also
a key  challenge  to sustainability, thus requiring a holistic approach in the
formulation of relevant strategies, which must address these issues comprehensively,
and not in a piecemeal way. As a result, Bahrain's Economic Vision 2030 focuses
on issues such as the environment, sustainable resource management, urban
development, water and energy, transport, urban growth, waste management, as well
as marine conservation and biodiversity, recognizing them as existing and serious
issues. Sustainability is one of three principles guiding for Bahrain's Vision 2030,
government programs (for example in environment and urban development), and
other relevant policies and strategies (including in the areas of energy, agriculture,
and water, etc.)
