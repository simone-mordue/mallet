Although there has been a reduction in newly diagnosed cases of AIDS and in AIDS-related deaths
because of the use of anti-retroviral drugs, the fight against HIV/AIDS continues. The national
adult HIV prevalence rate is 3.3%, which is among the highest in the Caribbean region, and there
is a  challenge  with under-reporting of HIV transmission through injected drug use33. Rates of HIV
infection among pregnant women have remained relatively stable. Between 2003 and 2013, there
were no reports of any child being born infected with HIV when the mothers received and adhered
to appropriate Prevention of Mother-To-Child Transmission (PMTCT) ARV treatment34
