It became clear during the process of preparing this review that raising awareness of
the Sustainable Development Goals is vital to its success and requires working
across several development areas. One of the most important of these is the

Political Forum on Sustainable Development 2016, in enabling Small Island
Developing States to reap the benefits of the 2030 Agenda, by mobilizing resources
from all sources for the effective implementation of sustainable delivery; and in
utilizing the Addis Ababa Action Agenda to secure sources of funding for the
implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development
