3.8 Achieve universal health coverage, including financial risk protection, access to
quality essential health-care services and access to safe, effective, quality and affordable
essential medicines and vaccines for all
The introduction of the National Health Insurance scheme in 2001 was intended to make universal
health care available to the population without any financial barriers. This model was implemented
in a limited geographic and population area. At present the scheme services a population of
120,000 (33% of the total population) . A key  challenge , limiting programme coverage is that the plan
is that the NHI continues to be funded by general revenue and sustainability and financing mecha-
nisms have not been finalized
