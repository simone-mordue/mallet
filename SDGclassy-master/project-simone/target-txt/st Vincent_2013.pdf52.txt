Managing the marine environment and its resources is also a  challenge . The country has a
territorial sea of 12 nautical miles and an Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) and
continental shelf of 200 nautical miles. Policing and protecting this resource is beyond
the capability of the local Coast Guard. Criminal activities in these water and Cays are a
growing concern
