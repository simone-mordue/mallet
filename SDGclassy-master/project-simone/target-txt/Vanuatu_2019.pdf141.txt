2.10 NATIONAL INSTITUTION S AND ADMINISTRATIVE CAPACITY
Vanuatu's National Development Strategy is the Priorities and Action Agenda (PAA) formulated
in 2006 (covering 2006-2015). It is based on the longer term objectives of the Comprehensive
Reform Program (CRP) on which Vanuatu embarked in 1997 and further revised in 2006. The
main agenda for action includes increasing productivity in key sectors - especially agriculture
and tourism - maintaining macroeconomic stability, cutting costs associated with transport and
utilities, improving service effectiveness and enhancing access to basic services such as health
and education. PAA priorities link to the Millennium Development Goals and cross cutting
issues. The  challenge  remains for the government to put in place an effective monitoring and
evaluation system inregarding progress on government strategic policy priorities
