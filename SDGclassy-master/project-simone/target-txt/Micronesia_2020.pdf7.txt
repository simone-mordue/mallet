At the National level, the SD Council and its NBSAP Panel provided the Department of Economic
Affairs with the necessary advice and support to successfully implement a process throughout all four
States of the FSM. The most credit for the success of the NBSAP process goes to the four States,
particularly the Biodiversity groups and the NBSAP counterparts who took on the  challenge  at the early
stages of the process and continued with a strong resolve to complete consultations and ensure this
document reflects the priorities of their States. The numerous individuals making up these biodiversity
groups and acting as counterparts, must be commended for their dedication and sustained efforts
throughout the process. The consultant that drafted this document and those who contributed technical
reports must also be congratulated for their efforts in assisting this process
