2.9 Water
Presently, the different aspects of water use and water management are under the responsibility of
different authorities: the Water Resources Unit of the Ministry of Energy and Public Utilities is
responsible for the assessment, development, management and conservation of all water resources in
the country. The Ministry of Environment and Sustainable Development is responsible for the
preparation and issue of guidelines, standards and regulations on water quality and effluent limitations,
while the Central Water Authority is mandated to provide a sustainable water supply service to the
people and to support economic development. The Wastewater Management Authority is responsible
for the collection, treatment and disposal of wastewater from domestic, commercial and industrial
sources (MEO, 2011). This fragmentation in responsibilities is a  challenge  for the efficient and effective
management of this vital but scarce resource. With the current trend in reduction of precipitation,
coupled with insufficient water harvesting and storage structures, the water issue is expected to
become one of the major challenges facing the country in the coming years
