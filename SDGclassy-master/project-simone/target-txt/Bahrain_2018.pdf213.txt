In the last decade, the pace of foreign interference in the affairs of the Kingdom of
Bahrain has increased, according to irrefutable evidence, including documents in
clear violation of the principles of respect for the sovereignty of states, non-
interference in their internal affairs and good-neighbourliness, as affirmed by the
principles of the United Nations Charter and international law. This is of course in
addition to the impact on the Kingdom's quest for comprehensive sustainability and
national capacity-building in various areas of development. The Kingdom of
Bahrain offers a distinctive development model according to international indicators,
but it faces a security  challenge  from state sponsored terrorism, which targets its
stability and development plans. Security and development are fundamental
requirements that are inseparably linked - one cannot be achieved without the
other - and both can only be achieved through a state that is secure and has good
governance in place. Providing sustainable growth remains contingent to ensuring
the effectiveness of security, stability, human development, and the preservation of
human values. Bahrain has maintained a balance between security and development
in a stable environment. It has confronted terrorism within the framework of the rule
of law and human rights. At the same time, it has consistently pursued development
and directed efforts and resources to serve the welfare of citizens and residents
