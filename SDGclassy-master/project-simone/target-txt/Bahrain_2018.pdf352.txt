Population growth also poses both a  challenge  and an opportunity for Bahrain. The
pressures it places on resources, the environment, and society are matched by the
opportunities it creates to boost the labour market with qualified local labour and its
impact on maintaining and improving the standard of living. Stability, peace, and
tolerance within society are crucial to enhancing democratic systems, attracting
foreign investments, developing new economic engines, and in providing rewarding
employment opportunities for citizens facing the effects of the global and regional
economic recession and low oil prices
