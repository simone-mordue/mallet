2.16 Climate Change
Climate change is another major  challenge  gaining more and more prominence in the Republic of
Mauritius. However, there are as yet insufficient national-level studies on climate change impacts, on
vulnerability and risk assessment in vulnerable areas and on ecosystems services. There is no
comprehensive and dedicated legislation related to climate change. While a Climate Change Action Plan
was developed in 1998, follow-up of the proposed action plan was uncoordinated. Some measures have
been integrated while others have not been implemented due to a lack of technical, human and
institutional capacity. Capacities to tackle climate change issues are also insufficient in the country,
particularly with respect to trained personnel, technical and technological options as well as funding to
enable climate change adaptation and mitigation
