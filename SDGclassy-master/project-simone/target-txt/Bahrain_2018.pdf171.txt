Although improving the quality of formal education should remain a key objective
of national policies, it is also worthwhile recognizing that development in education
is not limited to just formal education systems. Action plans in this area should take
into account the potentially valuable role of informal educational institutions and
systems in terms of positive impact in emphasizing common values and constructive
social norms. The educational curricula should also adopt modern teaching methods,
which support students to proactively  challenge  negative ideas and help them to
develop the ability to think logically. Students should be supported to innovate,
engage with science and technology, and develop creativity in literary and technical
fields. Success in this will require cooperation and cross-fertilization between the
different parts of the state involved in the delivery of the sustainable development
agenda
