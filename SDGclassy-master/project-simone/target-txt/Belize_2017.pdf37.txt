The management of data also remains a  challenge  requiring intervention. On this front, the Govern-
ment of Belize has taken initial steps aimed at transforming the existing Statistical Institute of Belize
(SIB) to a National Statistical System (NSS). The envisioned system will serve as a coordinating
mechanism collection and will collaborate in the compilation and publication of statistical informa-
tion for all sustainable development related data. The NSS is instrumental in the maintenance of a
comprehensive list of national indicators to meet the country's data needs and establish common
methodologies and standards. Enabling the functionality of the system are investments in institu-
tional reforms and capacity building , supported in part through partnerships with the Inter-American
Development Bank (I DB) and the United Nations System. The NSS is an important opportunity for
improving the gaps in data management. Implementation of system development alongside the
GSDS roll out provides a pathway for strategic capacity development and system integration
