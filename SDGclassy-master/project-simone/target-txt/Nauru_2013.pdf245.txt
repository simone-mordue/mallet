     2) Wastes: Limited availability of suitable land for landfills and the distance from markets
         increases makes waste management in Nauru a  challenge . The fragile natural ecosystem,
         biodiversity and public health are threatened by the accumulation of wastes on the island,
         particularly liquid and hazardous wastes. Much of the waste generation in Nauru is 'imported
         wastes'  -  the by product of an imported product. Properly managing wastes and minimizing
         wastes, especially those from imports, within the small land mass will continue to be a problem
         for Nauru
