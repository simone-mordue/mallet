1.1 Summary of Preparation: St. Vincent and the Grenadines (SVG) as an active member of
Caribbean Community (CARICOM) and the Organization of East Caribbean States (OECS),
endeavors to fulfill all of the obligations and reporting requirements to these organization

embraced the principles of Agenda 21 and the 14 point program of the Barbados Program
of Action (BPOA). The preparation process leading to Rio+20 got off to a late start and
consequently a national report was not prepared for that meeting
