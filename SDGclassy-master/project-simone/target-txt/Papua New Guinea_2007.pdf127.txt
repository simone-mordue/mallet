16. The basis of Vision 2050 is embedded in the Constitutional Planning Committee (CPC) Report (1974),
     which makes direct reference to the need for a long-term development strategy to achieve the Eight
     Aims. The Constitution takes up this  challenge  by directly institutionalising the National Goals and
     Directive Principles in its Preamble. The CPC Report (Chapter 2, Section 4), specifically states:
               We leaders and people must know where we want to go before we can decide how we
               should get there. Before a driver starts a motor car, he should first decide on his
               destination, otherwise his driving will be without purpose, and he will achieve nothing
