There is no formal sustainable development agenda in St. Vincent and the Grenadines but
most of the elements spelt out in the Barbados Program of Action have been addressed to
some measure in the country's development thrust in a sectorial manner as reflected by the
Medium Term economic Strategy Paper (MESTP) and the National Economic and Social
Development Plan (NESDP). The findings of one independent reviewer2 show St. Vincent
and the Grenadines as having achieved seven of the eight Millennium Development Goals
(MDGs) being deficient only in Goal 8, Global Partnership for Development. However, the
MDG monitoring unit based in the Statistical Department of the Government recorded only
partial success for Goals 3, 4, 6 and 7. The  challenge  with goal number 7 is the weak data
collection mechanism to facilitate tracking of the indicators. Tracking Goal number 8 has
also proved challenging and there is often a big difference between partnership
pronouncement and implementation
