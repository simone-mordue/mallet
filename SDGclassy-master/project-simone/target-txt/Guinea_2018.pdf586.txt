The second  challenge  is to ensure that protective measures and considered reasonable exploitation (diagrams and planning
procedures) take into account the expectations, needs and concerns of local residents. Indeed, this is the only condition thatthe
results could be sustainable. This implies that policy dialogue should first involve local people from the conceptual phase. Then,
these policies must provide compensation measures by specific actions of rural development, the restrictions imposed by the
classification and forest management in the previous year of some traditional rights of use (crops, grazing, hunting); of incentive
measures of peripheral populations to the benefits of the forest (jobs, income of some forest products, allocation of tourism and
craft recipes) and awareness-raising measures and appropriate environmental training (demonstration of the beneficial
contributions of a protected forest ecosystem)
