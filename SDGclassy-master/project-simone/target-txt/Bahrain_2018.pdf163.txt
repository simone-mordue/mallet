The Kingdom of Bahrain has also taken strides in supporting the seventh target of
Goal 4 (Target 4.7) to ensure that all learners acquire the knowledge and skills to
support sustainable development. This includes, through education, adopting
sustainable lifestyles, human rights, gender equality, promoting a culture of peace
and non-violence, global citizenship, and appreciation of cultural diversity and the
contribution of culture to sustainable development. This has been done in partnership
and cooperation with the Ministry of Youth and Sports, which has delivered
programs and organized conferences to promote the realization of these goals and
targets by 2030. Innovation is considered one of the most important drivers of
economic growth (Goal 9). A key determinant of the economy's ability to innovate
is the educational attainment level of the population and the production of research
and development by universities and the private sector (Goal 9). This is one of the
key challenges faced by Bahrain, particularly given its small population (1.5 million)
and limited resources that hinder Bahrain's competition with innovators working in
larger economies. However, Bahrain has responded positively to this  challenge  by
launching its National Strategy for Scientific Research in 2014, strengthening
research capabilities and encouraging integration between academic institutions, the
private sector, and international scientific research institutions, as well as promoting
a culture of scientific research
