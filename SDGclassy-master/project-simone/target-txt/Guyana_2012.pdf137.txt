    •  Climate variability (El Niño phenomenon) and global climate change remains one of the main
       challenges to Guyana, though the Government of Guyana has to address the issue of flood risks
       disasters in a direct manner. Recent experiences indicate that both coastal and interior regions are
       under threat. The economic risks posed by these natural and human induced hazards are significant:
       for example, the 2005 floods (due to rainfall intensity not experienced in Guyana since 1888) affected
       59 % of the country's GDP (ECLAC, 2005). One direct  challenge  of climate posed by climate
       variability and climate change is food and water security, even though Guyana is doing well so far
