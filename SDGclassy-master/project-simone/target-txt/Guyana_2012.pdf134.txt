Additionally, Guyana still faces the challenges that have been elucidated in its 2004 Assessment Report on
the Barbados Programme of Action Plus 10, though their magnitude has taken on new dimensions. For
example:
    â€¢  Guyana's small and developing economy is still vulnerable to external shocks including the ongoing
       global financial crisis since we are connected and affected by the global market. The global financial
       shocks may increase the demand and price for certain commodities such as gold, and this may present
       a  challenge  in terms of how the resource extraction will be managed in the context of a green
       economy: more people are mining and more companies are looking to go into mining
