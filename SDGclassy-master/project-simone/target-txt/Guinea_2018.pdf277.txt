Environmental degradation (mainly due to deforestation) is probably the biggest  challenge . The Guinea is among the 10
countries in the world that the rate of deforestation was highest in 2014, according to Global Forest Watch. This trend associated
with high population growth (2.6% annually) is and will be a source of increasing impact of hydrometeorological phenomena. The
seismic risk, although uncommon, is not to be overlooked because of its potential impact. In this context, and especially in the
post-Ebola recovery, the Government of Guinea, with the support of TFP has provided the country with a legislative, policy,
institutional and operational framework to better prepare for and respond to crises the future, and also to prevent the potential
risks from becoming disasters
