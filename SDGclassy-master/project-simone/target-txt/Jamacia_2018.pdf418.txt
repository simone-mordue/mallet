                  Nonetheless, the extent to which meaningful progress in these areas will be
               possible depends on the financial and technical resources available and accessible,
               whether within its coﬀers or through partnerships. As a highly indebted, upper
               middle income country, the adequacy of financial resources remains a  challenge ,
               particularly as there is need to balance the "bread and butter" (day to day) needs of
               the country with the short to long-term and capital intensive demands of climate
               change. Nonetheless, every eﬀort is being made to maximise on partnerships with
               the citizenry, non-State actors (including community groups, private sector entities
               and academia), the international community, and donors can build resilience to
               climate change in a holistic manner
