2.1.2 Environmental Sustainability: Maintenance of healthy ecosystems and the
sustainable use of natural resource is the goal of the Environmental Management
Department within the Ministry of Health Wellness and the Environment. In pursuit of this
goal, the government has signed the St. Georges Declaration (SGD) of Principles for
Environmental Sustainability in the OECS, ratified the Convention on Biological Diversity
(UNCBD) and met all of the obligations associated with these agreements. The government
has also ratified the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change
(UNFCCC), the Convention to Combat Desertification (UNCCD) [and fight land
degradation], the Cartagena Protocol on land based sources of marine pollution, and the
Stockholm Convention on persistent organic pollutants (POPs). St. Vincent and the
Grenadines has also signed on to the Caribbean  Challenge  Initiative (CCI) with the pledge
to protect 20% of its near shore marine and coastal resources by 2020. All of these efforts are
designed to conserve the island's natural resources, manage its biodiversity resources and
ensure a clean safe and healthy environment. Compliance with the obligations of the
aforementioned agreements is indicative of St. Vincent and the Grenadines achievement of
