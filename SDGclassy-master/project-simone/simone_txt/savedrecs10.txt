AB AIM: This study attempted to evaluate the real and perceived body
   weight, exercise habits and weight-altering dietary supplement use by
   adolescents attending schools in Trinidad and Tobago.
   METHODS: A de novo questionnaire was administered prospectively to
   15-19-year-old to determine their exercise habits, their perceived body
   weights, and their use of any weight gain or weight loss supplements. A
   subset of students had their actual height and weights recorded and BMI
   calculated.
   RESULTS: Five hundred and eighty-three students did the questionnaire
   (88% response rate), and 363 students had BMI calculated. Some 14.9%
   (54/363) of the students were overweight, and 15.4% (56/363) were obese,
   and more than 75% of the obese students had attempted weight loss in the
   past. These measures included exercise in the majority of the students
   and use of dietary supplements in the minority. Only 6% of the obese
   students exercised five or more times per week. About 28% of the
   students misclassified their body weights, and perception of body weight
   influenced weight loss behaviors more than actual body weights.
   CONCLUSION: Almost one third of the students were overweight or obese.
   Overweight students were motivated to lose weight, and these students
   need to have some structured health promotion program, which educates
   them on correct exercise habits, safe measures to lose weight, and which
   informs them of their actual body weight.

AB The Tamana Formation of the Central Range of Trinidad was studied in
   order to determine its importance in the stratigraphical and structural
   development of north-eastern South America. Biostratigraphical,
   petrological and mineralogical data, combined with field mapping show
   that the Tamana sediments are composed of five distinct lithofacies:
   inner to outer shelf, burrowed shaley mudstone; outer shelf, Fe-rich
   sandy limestone; submarine channel, conglomeratic mudstone; middle shelf
   to nearshore, algal-foram packstone/grainstone; and intertidal to
   nearshore, algal-stromatolite-coral boundstone with coral bioherms.
   Maximum thickness of the Tamana Formation is 244 m.
   Deposition of the Tamana limestones occurred between the Praeorbulina
   glomerosa (latest early Miocene) and Globorotalia fohsi robusta (middle
   part of the middle Miocene) planktonic foraminiferal zones, and in a
   more continuous trend than is seen in the current outcrop belt. Detailed
   biostratigraphy shows that the Tamana Formation is a facies equivalent
   of the shallow- and deep-water shales of the Brasso Formation, and the
   deep water turbidites of the Herrera Member of the Cipero Formation.
   The early diagenetic history of the Tamana limestones was dominated by
   the precipitation of authigenic glauconitic smectite, and the
   dissolution of skeletal grains and carbonate matrix. Late burial
   diagenesis was dominated by the precipitation of illite and
   illite/smectite. Comparative mineralogy and textural analyses indicate a
   minimum range of burial depth for the Tamana Formation at 800-1500 m,
   with a maximum of 2400 m. Alteration of Fe-bearing minerals to geothite
   and late fracturing occurred during post-Pliocene tectonic uplift and
   unroofing of the Central Range.
   The Tamana Formation sediments can be used as a structural and
   stratigraphical event marker within the Late Tertiary geological history
   of Trinidad. These units record a phase of the tectonic interaction
   between the Caribbean and South American plates in the south-eastern
   Caribbean, and reflect the onset of contractile deformation in the
   Central Range.

AB Pressurised hot water extraction (PHWE) was applied to chilies in order
   to optimise extraction yield of capsaicinoids (capsaicin,
   dihydrocapsaicin, nordihydrocapsaicin, nonivamide). Determination of the
   optimum extraction procedure was performed by comparison of the yield of
   the extracts. Capsaicinoids content was determined by HPLC coupled with
   mass spectrometry. An optimisation study was performed using water as an
   extraction solvent at constant extraction pressure (20 MPa), extraction
   temperature ranging from 120 to 240 degrees C and static extraction time
   ranging from 5 to 60 min as independent variables. The optimum PHWE
   conditions for all response variables were estimated; however, PHWE
   conditions resulting in the highest recovery of capsaicinoids (20 MPa,
   200 degrees C and 10 + 20 min of static extraction time) were chosen for
   comparison with a conventional Soxhlet extraction (SOX) in the case of
   seven chili pepper fruit samples (chili peppers of species Capsicum
   chinenses: Trinidad Scorpion Moruga, Jamaican Hot Red, and Yellow
   Habanero, chilies of species Capsicum annuum: Yellow Bedder, Ring of

AB Macro- and meiobenthos contribute substantially to the diversity of
   marine habitats and should account for a significant fraction of the
   diversity in coral reefs. The aims of the present study are to
   characterize macro-and meiobenthic communities in a Caribbean coral reef
   and to analyze the effects of habitat type on the alpha-, beta-, and
   gamma-diversity of free-living nematodes. Two reef sites with four
   habitat types each were selected: seagrass bed, bare sand, coral rubble,
   and algal turf. Habitats within sites were adjacent to each other and
   characterized by their physical architecture, hydrodynamic regime, and
   foundation species. The diversity of marine communities was high, with
   eight phyla represented in the macrobenthos and 18 phyla in the
   meiobenthos. The structure of macrobenthos was strongly associated with
   the habitat type. This relationship was weaker for meiobenthos, which is
   likely related to ecological drift, hydrodynamic regime, and
   macrobenthic influence. The nematode species richness was high at both
   studied scales: alpha-diversity ranged from 31 to 83 species per habitat
   and gamma-diversity for the whole reef was 156 +/- 4 species. The
   nematode assemblages consisted of few dominant and many rare species,
   which is typical of hyperdiverse faunas. The beta-diversity was large in
   the reef with few shared species and the presence of distinctive
   nematode assemblages adapted to the physical architecture and food
   availability of each habitat. The results imply that the physical
   structure and heterogeneity of the coral reef habitats are important for
   maintaining the high diversity of small invertebrates, especially
   regarding the richness and turnover of nematode species.

AB The Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction emphasizes four
   principles: understanding risk; strengthening governance; investing in
   resilience; and building back better. Parametric insurance, offered to
   nations, provides a financial platform to pool and transfer risk from
   the regional to the global marketplace. The Caribbean Ocean Assets
   Sustainability faciliTy (COAST) expands upon the prior success of
   parametric insurance by providing a new platform to more fully link
   policy and technology with the aim of increasing disaster resilience.
   COAST focuses upon the nexus among food and nutrition security, the
   health of the ocean, and the occurrence of severe weather in the
   Caribbean Sea. The benefits of COAST - linking the technologies
   highlighted in the Climate-Smart Agriculture Sourcebook and the goals of
   the Caribbean Community Common Fisheries Policy - are examined using
   ghost fishing and spiny lobster as an example. This study points to the

   dominance of gamma-Proteobacteria is the unique characteristic of this
   shallow vent and it coincides with the South Tonga Arc and Bahia
   Concepcion (Pacific Ocean), whereas epsilon-Proteobacteria groups were
   reported to be high in the majority of the hydrothermal vents. Though
   the sampling sites of the venting and non-venting regions of Espalamaca
   were only 500 m apart, high variation (>80%) of phylotypes was found

AB Belize has an area of 21 400 km(2) and a population of approximately 200
   000. Although the average population density is low, concentrated
   land-use activities near populated areas have the potential to affect
   water quality. Land-use activities are shifting from small low impact
   traditional farming systems (milpa) to large slash and burn areas and
   commercial citrus production. An increasing population leads to
   increased development and increased industrial activity. Most major
   rivers drain into the Caribbean Sea and in most situations pose little
   known environmental consequences, However, Belize has the world's second
   largest barrier reef that is strongly promoted in their ecotourism
   industry and thus can ill afford any natural resource impact. The
   potential effects of land-use activities on water quality need to be
   evaluated, The Belize Environmental Protection Act of 1993 requires a
   comprehensive environmental monitoring programme. This paper discusses
   the development of a national surface water quality monitoring programme
   for Belize.

AB We modeled the potential distribution of plant species that grow on the

   areas of high biodiversity. We used environmental layers in combination
   with georeferenced data, utilizing the MaxEnt algorithm, and produced
   four regional consensus maps according to the geographic distribution of
   the species: along the entire Mexican Atlantic coast, the Gulf of
   Mexico; the Yucatan Peninsula and all species combined together on a
   single map. The largest number of widely distributed species in the Gulf
   of Mexico was concentrated in the northern and central regions, while
   biodiversity on the Yucatan Peninsula was likely to be concentrated in
   the north and on Cozumel island, which is the biggest island in the
   Mexican Caribbean. The map combining all species together revealed a
   potential concurrence of species in the Gulf of Mexico and Yucatan
   Peninsula transition, where climatic characteristics converge within a
   small geographic area. In order to conserve beach and coastal dune plant
   biodiversity, special attention must be paid to the management plans of
   established protected areas and to the promotion of new protected areas
   consistent with the areas reported in this study, particularly in the
   central Gulf of Mexico and northern Yucatan Peninsula, where areas under

   confirmation of Lapita-age use of nut-cracking tools. The careful
   shaping of the tool, combined with ethnographic comparisons, suggests

AB New Guinea is one of five high biodiversity wilderness areas, and frog
   diversity is exceptionally large, with more than 400 species described
   to date. The microhylid frog genus Mantophryne is endemic to New Guinea
   and consists of four species, three of which have narrow geographic
   distributions and a fourth, M. lateralis, with a broad range that spans
   the eastern half of the island. Here, we sequence 104 Mantophryne
   samples for three mitochondrial and three nuclear loci to reconstruct
   the first phylogeny of the genus and to examine spatial patterns of
   diversity within M. lateralis. Results indicate that the wide-ranging M.
   lateralis is composed of at least nine geographically separated and
   well-supported lineages that represent putative species. Biogeographic
   analysis suggests that Mantophryne evolved on the eastern Papuan
   peninsula with subsequent dispersal westward, as well as overwater
   dispersal events to the Louisiade and D'Entrecasteaux archipelagos. (C)

AB [1] On the basis of daily Saharan dust samples collected at Sal Island
   (Cape Verde Archipelagos) and Barbados (Caribbean Sea) over 3 years,
   this study focuses on the mineralogical signature of the African sources
   providing dust over the tropical North Atlantic Ocean. First, the
   sources of the collected dust were localized by using relative clays
   abundance (illite-to-kaolinite ratio) combined with Meteosat infrared
   imagery, horizontal visibility, and backward trajectories of dusty air
   masses. Then, each identified source was linked to a single value of the
   illite-to-kaolinite ratio. Those results highlight that the clay content
   of the emitted dust depends directly on both the latitude and the
   longitude of the source. Dust originating from northwestern sources
   exhibits illite-to-kaolinite ratios higher than those from Sahelian
   regions. Likewise, illite-to-kolinite ratio decreases from west to east.

AB A non-overlapping acoustic receiver array was used to track the
   movements of two common shark species, nurse Ginglymostoma cirratum
   (n=25) and Caribbean reef Carcharhinus perezi (n=5), in and around,
   Glover's Reef Marine, Reserve (GRMR) off the coast of Belize, between
   May and October, 2004. Although both species exhibited partial site
   fidelity in that they were most likely to be detected near the area of
   original capture both species also moved widely throughout the 10 by 30
   km atoll. One Caribbean reef shark was detected by a monitor at
   Lighthouse Reef, km from Glover's Reef across deep (> 400m) open water.
   The mean minimum linear dispersal (MLD) was 10.5 km for Caribbean reef
   sharks and 7.7 km for nurse sharks, with man individuals travelling more
   than the 10 km width of the no-take "conservation zone" of the marine
   reserve. Although most sharks were tagged within the, conservation,
   zone, individuals were detected outside this part of GRMR on average 48
   days out of the 150 days of observations. However, of 7 nurse sharks
   tagged near the center of the conservation zone, 4 were never detected
   outside of this part of the reserve. In general, this study suggests
   that effective consevation of these large roving predators requires an
   ecosystem-based management approach including a zoned management plan,
   similar to that used at GRMR, in which a fairly large no-take reserve,
   incorporating diverse habitats and the connections between them as
   surrounded by a larger area in which fishing is regulated.

AB The stability of ecological communities largely depends on the strength
   of interactions between predators and their prey. Here we show that
   these interaction strengths are structured nonrandomly in a large
   Caribbean marine food web. Specifically, the cooccurrence of strong
   interactions on two consecutive levels of food chains occurs less
   frequently than expected by chance. Even when they occur, these strongly
   interacting chains are accompanied by strong omnivory more often than
   expected by chance. By using a food web model, we show that these
   interaction strength combinations reduce the likelihood of trophic
   cascades after the overfishing of top predators. However, fishing
   selectively removes predators that are overrepresented in strongly
   interacting chains. Hence, the potential for strong community-wide
   effects remains a threat.

   collected from intertidal and subtidal habitats in the vicinity of Pine
   Cay, Turks and Caicos, British West Indies. Five species, Licranthura
   tuberculata, Mesanthura spongicola, Califanthura minuta, Stenetrium
   caicoensis, and Armaddilloniscus stepus, are known currently only from
   the northeastern Turks and Caicos Islands. The Turks and Caicos
   collections represent considerable range extensions for many of the
   species collected. Four species, Apanthura cracenta, Mesanthura
   punctillata, Carpias triton, and Munna petronastes, known previously
   from the east coast of Central America (Belize), are reported for the
   first time since their description. This report also presents the first
   published records from outside of their respective type localities for
   Amakusanthura significa, Mexicope kensleyi, Carpias brachydactylus,
   Carpias serricaudus, Uromunna caribea, stenetrium monocule, and
   Stenobermuda acutirostrata. The other species reported, mostly
   flabelliferans, appear to be widely distributed in the tropical western
   North Atlantic and their occurrence in the Turks and Caicos was not
   unexpected.

AB A complete, but fractured and crushed, echinoid corona from early to
   middle Miocene of Sarawak, Malaysia, is described as a new species,
   Clypeaster sarawakensis nov. sp. Although similar to modern C.
   rarispinus, the new species shows a distinct set of characters including
   petal length, periproct position and gut coiling. The discovery of a new
   Clypeaster, a genus characterised by a high preservation potential,
   illustrates that little is known about echinoid evolution and
   diversification in the Central Indo-Pacific, which features as a
   biodiversity hotspot since the Oligocene. Besides describing Clypeaster
   sarawakensis, we also compiled the known Central Indo-Pacific echinoid
   fossil record and used it to examine the Cenozoic diversity of
   echinoids. The overall diversity throughout the Cenozoic, and especially
   the rapid diversity increase at the Oligocene-Miocene boundary,
   corresponds to diversity trends observed in other taxa from the region.

AB The diet of Octopus vulgaris was determined from the remains of 649 prey
   items gathered from the middens of 38 dens in a small area off the
   Caribbean island of Bonaire. Remains of 35 species of gastropod (19 % of
   the total), 19 bivalves (51 %) and 21. crustaceans (30 %) were
   identified and examined for mode of entry into hard-shelled prey.
   Although 60% of the gastropods were drilled, neither the size/weight
   ratio nor the presence of an operculum determined whether drilling
   occurred. There were strong differences in prey preference among
   individual octopuses, and the Cardona niche breadth index (B') of the
   midden items was 0.08, indicative of specialization. Examples include
   the exclusive preference for Pinna carnea by one den occupant. This
   study, by focusing on assessment. of preference at specific den
   locations, is the first to show that while the population had a wide
   choice of prey items, the individual choices were much narrower,
   indicating that octopuses were specializing generalists.

AB The present study contributes to the knowledge of the cestode fauna of
   species of Styracura de Carvalho, Loboda & da Silva, which is the
   putative sister taxon of freshwater potamotrygonids-a unique group of
   batoids restricted to Neotropical freshwater systems. We document
   species of Rhinebothrium Linton, 1890 as a result of the examination of
   newly collected specimens of Styracura from five different localities
   representing the eastern Pacific Ocean and the Caribbean Sea. Overall,
   we examined 33 spiral intestines, 11 from the eastern Pacific species
   Styracura pacifica (Beebe & Tee-Van) and 22 from the Caribbean species
   S. schmardae (Werner). However, only samples from the Caribbean were
   infected with members of Rhinebothrium. Rhinebothrium tetralobatum
   Brooks, 1977, originally described from S. schmardae-as Himantura
   schmardae (Werner)-off the Caribbean coast of Colombia based on six
   specimens is redescribed. This redescription provides the first data on
   the microthriches pattern, more details of internal anatomy (i.e.,
   inclusion of histological sections) and expands the ranges for the
   counts and measurements of several features. We describe a new species
   of Rhinebothrium from S. schmardae collected off the Caribbean coast of
   Panama. Rhinebothrium reydai n. sp. is diagnosed by possessing four
   testes per proglottid, acraspedote proglottids, single anterior-most and
   porterior-most loculi, and bothridia divided into 34-44 loculi.
   Collectively, these features distinguish the new species from all 41
   species of Rhinebothrium currently recognized as valid, with the
   exception of R. chollaensis Friggens & Duszynski, 2005. The latter
   species, a parasite of Urobatis halleri (Cooper) from the eastern
   Pacific Ocean, has a similar morphology in comparison to R. reydai n.
   sp., but can be distinguished by being apolytic instead of euapolytic
   and by the morphology of the aporal lobe of the ovary, which reaches the
   mid-lateral margin of the cirrus sac, whereas in R. reydai n. sp. the
   aporal lobe only reaches the posterior margin, since the cirrus sac
   takes approximately 3/4 of the proglottid in width. Also, in R. reydai
   n. sp., the first square proglottid occurs within the anterior third of
   the strobila (13-30%), whereas in R. chollaensis it occurs near the
   middle of the strobila (42-62%). Further, we discuss the patterns of
   infection and biogeographical distribution for species of Rhinebothrium
   in species of Styracura. The apparent disjunctive distribution of R.
   tetralobatum and R. reydai n. sp. in the Caribbean Sea throughout their
   host distribution, S. schmardae, and the absence of species of
   Rhinebothrium in the eastern Pacific sister-host, S. pacifica, reveal
   the importance of sample size and biogeographical representation for
   documenting the parasite fauna of host lineages.

AB Longline sampling (83 sets) supplemented with 6 pop-off archival
   transmitting (PAT) tag deployments were used to characterize vertical
   habitat use by Caribbean reef sharks Carcharhinus perezi at Glover's
   Reef atoll, Belize. Longline catch-per-unit-effort (CPUE) in 2 shallow
   reef habitats (lagoon <18 m depth, fore-reef <40 m depth) underwent
   significant nocturnal increases for sharks larger than 110 cm total
   length (TL), but not for smaller sharks. Nocturnal CPUE of small sharks
   appeared to increase in the lagoon and decrease on the fore-reef,
   suggestive of movements to avoid larger conspecifics. PAT tag
   deployments (7 to 20 d) indicate that large C. perezi generally
   increased the amount of time they spent in the upper 40 m of the water
   column during the night, and inhabited much greater depths and tolerated
   lower temperatures than previously described. The wide vertical (0 to
   356 m) and temperature range (31 to 12.4 degrees C) documented for this
   top-predator reveals ecological coupling of deep and shallow reef
   habitats and has implications for Marine Protected Area (MPA) design.

   the range of healthy floods available varied greatly across these

   stores/supermarkets, cost, and limited availability of healthful floods
   were common features, which limited access to health-promoting food
   options. Features specific to each population should be. considered in

   openness of stores, mix of types of food sources); consumer (e.g.,
   adequacy of the food supply, seasonal factors); and social (e.g.,
   inter-household food sharing, perceptions of food quality, language

AB Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to canvass the views of villagers
   from a remote region of Papua New Guinea (PNG) on food security issues
   in their community and their level of satisfaction with food security
   initiatives provided by the extractive company that operated on their
   land.
   Design/methodology/approach - Qualitative design: data gathered through
   14 semi-structured, face-to-face interviews and a discussion forum with
   20 villagers from Pawa. Purposive sampling. Snow-balling method of
   recruitment.
   Findings - Food security was identified as a growing concern among the
   villagers, who also expressed dissatisfaction with the food security
   projects offered through the corporate social responsibility (CSR)
   program offered by the company operating on their land. Communication
   problems between company and community and lack of trust were evident.
   Research limitations/implications - Possibility of self-selection bias
   among participants. The perspective of the company was
   under-represented.
   Practical implications - The study highlights the need for CSR
   practitioners to be mindful of the importance of effective communication
   with local communities.
   Social Implications - The study reveals the importance of meaningful
   dialogue between company and host communities, which can lead to a more
   efficient allocation of resources and empowerment of host communities.
   Originality/value - The study bridges a research gap in the field of CSR
   in developing countries because food security, as a CSR issue in PNG
   communities, is under-researched. The study contributes to a better
   understanding of company - community relations in PNG and how these
   relations can be improved through a more normative approach to CSR. It
   also highlights the importance of empowering host communities through
   meaningful dialogue.

   (flooding), shoreline erosion and groundwater salinization. Responses
   have been largely uninformed, many unsuccessful. By the year 2100, sea
   level may be 1.2m higher than today. Together with other climate-linked
   changes and unsustainable human pressures on coastal zones, this will
   pose huge challenges for livelihoods. There is an urgent need for
   effective and sustainable adaptation of livelihoods to prepare for
   future sea level rise in the Pacific Islands region. There are also
   lessons to be learned from past failures, including the need for
   adaptive solutions that are environmentally and culturally appropriate,
   and those which appropriate decision makers are empowered to design and
   implement. Around the middle of the twenty-first century, traditional
   coastal livelihoods are likely to be difficult to sustain, so people in
   the region will need alternative food production systems. Within the
   next 20-30 years, it is likely that many coastal settlements will need
   to be relocated, partly or wholly. There are advantages in anticipating
   these needs and planning for them sooner rather than later. In many
   ways, the historical and modern Pacific will end within the next few
   decades. There will be fundamental irreversible changes in island
   geography, settlement patterns, subsistence systems, societies and
   economic development, forced by sea level rise and other factors.

AB The growth of children in Tari is poorer than the growth of children in
   two-thirds of the highlands districts of Papua New Guinea. The important
   proximal determinants of these levels of growth in Tari are birthweight,
   food and nutrient intake and disease episodes. Birthweights in Tari are
   lower than in a number of other highlands centres and this is likely to
   be an important determinant of postnatal growth and disease,
   particularly for those whose birthweights are below 2500g. The overall
   effect of child feeding practices in Tari is that energy and protein
   intakes may be marginal after the first few months of life and
   contribute to the low levels of growth. Episodes of illness (young
   children experience an average of 4 episodes in the first year) decrease
   nutrient intake and increase nutrient requirements; this, combined with
   the failure to increase food intake during the convalescent period,
   means that the overall result of an episode of disease is a decrease in
   growth. There are functional consequences of this pattern of growth in
   Tari: low-birthweight children and those who are malnourished have a
   higher mortality rate than those of normal birthweight and growth, and
   short children have delays in achieving gross motor development
   milestones.

AB Major prolonged droughts in Mexico during the twentieth century are
   mainly related to anomalous dry Summers, such as those observed in the
   1930s, the 1950s, or the 1990s. Droughts in northern Mexico frequently
   coincide with anomalously wet conditions over Mesoamerica (i.e.,
   southern Mexico and Central America), and vice versa, displaying a
   dominant "seesaw" structure in persistent precipitation anomalies,
   mostly in relation to tropical sea surface temperature (SST) anomalies.
   A warmer North Atlantic Ocean, expressed as a positive phase of Atlantic
   multidecadal oscillation (AMO), is related to the occurrence of major
   droughts in North America associated with weaker-than-normal moisture
   flux into northern Mexico. Drought over northern Mexico may also be
   related to changes in transient activity in the Caribbean Sea. During
   the negative phase of the Pacific decadal oscillation (PDO), the
   Caribbean low-level jet (CLLJ) weakens and easterly wave (EW) activity
   increases, leading to more tropical convection over Mesoamerica and less
   moisture flux into northern Mexico. Oil the other hand, when EW activity
   is weak over the intra-Americas seas (IAS) (i.e. the Gulf of Mexico and
   the Caribbean Sea) because of a stronger-than-normal CLLJ, precipitation
   increases over northern Mexico. Therefore, the interaction between
   easterly waves and the trade winds over the IAS appears to be crucial to
   explain the spatial patterns of droughts that have affected Mexico. In
   addition, low-frequency modulators, such as AMO or PDO, may serve to
   explain the spatial patterns of severe prolonged droughts in Mexico
   during the nineteenth century.

AB The silky shark, Carcharhinus falciformis (Muller and Henle, 1839), is a
   large circumtropical, oceanic, and coastal-pelagic species whose spatial
   ecology is not well understood. In Cuba, silky sharks are captured in
   local fisheries and are subjects for shark-based diving tourism off the
   Caribbean coast. Our study tracked three female C. falciformis (ranging
   174-200 cm precaudal length) using satellite-linked tags to characterize
   the movement patterns and behavioral ecology of this species off the
   southeast coast of Cuba. Field work was conducted in the Jardines de la
   Reina (Gardens of the Queen) archipelago and utilized a novel in-water
   method for attaching pop-up satellite archival tags to free-swimming
   sharks. Results from both archival and position-only tags suggest the
   sharks traveled <30 km from the tagging site during the month-long
   deployments. The depth and temperature ranges recorded for two specimens
   were 0-640 m and 11.5-27.5 degrees C. Time-at-depth/temperature data
   revealed preferences for the upper-mixed layer (down to 150 m) and a
   temperature range of 24-27 degrees C. A diet vertical movement pattern
   was observed with silky sharks spending greater time at depth during the
   day than at night. Plasticity of vertical habitat utilization was noted
   with occasional forays to depths in excess of 550 m during both day and
   night. Daytime forays to surface waters were also observed and were most
   common during the morning hours between 09:00 and 11:00, possibly due to
   the ecotourism industry's use of bait during that time to attract sharks
   to the dive area.

AB Observations of currents aimed to study the flow near a spawning
   aggregation reef, Gladden Spit off the coast of Belize, reveal unusually
   strong currents on 19-20 October 2009 (the current speed was over 1 m
   s(-1), when the mean and standard deviation are 0.2 +/- 0.12 m s(-1)).
   During this short time, the water level was raised by 60-70 cm above
   normal in one place, but lowered by 10-20 cm in another location just 2
   km away. The temperature dropped by over 2A degrees C within a few
   hours. Analyses of local and remote sensing data suggest that a rare
   combination of an offshore Caribbean cyclonic eddy, a short-lived local
   tropical storm, and a Spring tide, all occurred at the same time and
   creating a "perfect storm" condition that resulted in the unusual event.
   High-resolution simulations and momentum balance analysis demonstrate
   how the unique shape of the coral reef amplified the coastal current
   through nonlinear flow-topography interactions. The suggested mechanism
   for the water level change is different than the classical wind-driven
   storm surge process. The study has implications for the influence of
   external forcing on mixing processes and physical-biological
   interactions near coral reefs.

AB Chemical composition was determined for 48 species of deep-sea demersal
   fishes to evaluate trends in compositional parameters with respect to
   depth and study area. Specimens were collected from depths of 100 m to
   over 5,000 m off the U.S. east coast between Cape Hatteras and Cape Cod
   and from similar depths off the Bahama Islands. Water, ash, nitrogen,
   and carbon contents were determined. Energy content was calculated based
   on carbon content. Water level and nitrogen content (% ash-free dry
   weight) of benthopelagic species with swim bladders increased while
   carbon (% wet weight), nitrogen (% wet weight), and energy content (kcal
   100 g(-1) wet weight) decreased as a function of depth. Benthopelagic
   species without swimbladders had higher water contents and lower
   skeletal ash (% wet weight), nitrogen (% wet weight), carbon (% wet
   weight), and energy contents than benthopelagic species with
   swimbladders or benthic species. Species from the U.S. east coast study
   area and species common to both study areas had higher energy contents
   than did species occurring only in the Bahamas. Trends in composition
   with depth appear to reflect reduced food availability at depth.
   Moreover, differences in chemical composition between study areas are
   consistent with the hypothesis that reduced food availability in the
   Bahamas relative to the temperate western North Atlantic is important in
   determining the species composition of the respective fish assemblages.

AB Roughly 70 species of sea snakes inhabit the Indo-Pacific but are absent
   from the Atlantic Ocean. Paleoclimatic conditions in the Coral Triangle
   were favorable for evolutionary transitions to the sea, while those in
   the Caribbean region and coastlines bordering the Atlantic Ocean were
   less favorable. The dispersal of sea snakes from the Indian to Atlantic
   Oceans around the Cape of Good Hope has been prevented by low water
   temperatures and a lack of precipitation related to the presence of the
   Benguela Current along the Atlantic coast of southern Africa. The
   Isthmus of Panama fully separated the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans before
   the speciation and dispersal of the sole pelagic species of sea snake to
   reach the Central American Pacific shoreline. Future climatic changes
   could bring declines or extinctions of sea snakes within their present
   ranges, but they appear unlikely to favor the dispersal and

AB Losses in coral cover have been widely reported for the Caribbean. In
   contrast, much less is known about the health state of the Brazilian
   reef fauna, which was declared as a priority for Atlantic biodiversity
   conservation due to its high degree of endemism. In the present study,
   we assessed the general health state of Phyllogorgia dilatata
   assemblages at the subtropical reefs of Arraial do Cabo (southeastern
   Brazil), where observations suggest that the abundance of this endemic
   gorgonian species has declined. We found that about 49% of the sampled
   colonies were dead, and 73% of the living colonies were affected by
   tissue loss. Tissue loss initially manifested as multifocal holes in the
   planar colonial coenenchyme and peripheral tissue retraction leaving
   denuded skeletal axes. In combination with other recent studies, our
   results raise the awareness for an increasingly threatened Southwestern

AB Fringe mangroves associated with islands of the subtropical
   Atlantic/Caribbean region create extensive subtidal mangrove epibiont
   communities. While increasingly recognized as an important habitat, few
   studies have focused on the trophic structure of communities associated
   with mangrove prop-roots. We examined trophic linkages among primary
   producers (mangroves, seagrass, and algae) and consumers using stable
   carbon and nitrogen isotopes in fringe mangroves of the Bahamas and
   Biscayne Bay, Florida. The average delta(13)C value of primary consumers
   (-16.4) was similar to macroalgae (-16.7) and seagrass epiphytes (-14.6)
   and highly distinguishable from mangroves (-27.4). Higher secondary
   consumers had enriched delta(13)C values (-10.1) relative to primary
   consumers, and were similar to average seagrass VC values (-10.5). The
   ranges of delta(15)N signatures of vertebrate (6.3-12) and invertebrate
   (-0.4-10.7) consumers indicated a multi-trophic structure. Based on
   mixing equations, the majority of primary consumers diet was algal
   based, while secondary consumers depended on both algal and seagrass
   carbon. Mangroves do not appear to be the major source of carbon to
   consumers in fringe mangroves of subtropical lagoons. Rather, fringe
   island-associated mangroves constitute refugia for invertebrates and
   young reef fishes, and create substrate for a diversity of primary
   producers and consumers, thereby playing an important indirect role to
   the food web of these systems.

AB The eastern Cayman Trough preserves a record of the Late Cretaceous to
   Paleogene Caribbean history that is largely affected by Neogene
   strike-slip tectonics of the current plate boundary. We conducted an
   analysis of seismic data within the eastern Cayman Trough, based upon
   single and multichannel seismic reflection profiles collected during the
   Seacarib II cruise in 1987 and the Casis cruise in 1992. These data show
   that the basement of the eastern Cayman Trough can be divided into four
   domains from east to west, with distinct morphologic and sedimentary
   character and inferred older to younger ages: (1) a province of rifted
   Mesozoic continental crust exhibiting seven parallel horst blocks
   striking northeast-southwest; (2) a continent-ocean transition between
   provinces 1 and 3 that exhibits seamounts, small hills, and sedimentary
   basins; (3) an Eocene oceanic crust with rough basement but smoother
   relief than the rifted crust; basement trends are roughly north-south
   and oblique to the northwest trend in domain 1, and (4) the northern
   Jamaica slope, which forms an east-west-trending slope, with
   northward-dipping strata that flank the three deeper water domains of
   the Cayman Trough.
   The domains are interpreted to be the product of the Eocene east-west
   opening of the Cayman Trough as a pull-apart basin in a left-lateral
   strike-slip setting. Closure of the 1100 km of Eocene and younger
   oceanic crust of the Cayman Trough places the fault-block province
   adjacent to the Belize margin of Central America. Restoration of normal
   faults in the fault-block province places an additional 190 km of
   left-lateral offset along the Cayman Trough. A Neogene phase of
   transpression has reactivated structures in the four domains, along with
   on-land structures described by previous authors in Jamaica. The
   proximity of the eastern margin of the Cayman Trough to petroliferous,
   continental rocks in Central America suggests an improved possibility of
   hydrocarbon potential. Unfortunately, sediment thicknesses of less than
   1 km probably are not conducive to hydrocarbon formation.

AB Observations along the north coast of Jamaica in 1994 suggested that
   areas of relatively high coral cover and high coral diversity occurred
   adjacent to reefs that have been in decline since 1980. This study was
   carried out to quantify these observations, to determine whether similar
   variation occurs elsewhere in the Caribbean, and to draw attention to
   the significance of kilometer-wide variation in coral reef community
   ecology. The fore reef (10 m depth) of Discovery Bay, Jamaica, had <3%
   coral cover, 12 species of scleractinians and >60% macroalgae cover and
   appeared typical of a highly degraded Caribbean reef. However,
   neighboring reefs (<9 km away) in the same reef zone and at the same
   depth had up to 19 species of scleractinians, significantly higher coral
   cover (5 to 23%) and lower macroalgae cover (10 to 39%). Three reefs
   along the south coast of St. John, US Virgin Islands (10 m depth), which
   are protected within a National park, displayed comparable
   kilometer-wide variation in coral cover (3 to 33%) and macroalgae cover
   (22 to 33%). The abundance of juvenile corals also displayed similar
   levels of kilometer-wide variation within both islands; These results
   demonstrate that several measures of coral reef community structure are
   highly variable over a spatial scale of kilometers; further study of
   these patterns may prove valuable in discerning the causes and
   consequences of coral demise. The existence of such large-scale
   variation emphasizes the importance of careful choice of sampling scale
   in the design and interpretation of monitoring programs in community
   ecology.

AB This paper describes the analytical and modelling methods employed in a
   Wind Resource Assessment (WRA) and reliability assessment of a Wind
   Energy Conversion System (WECS) for small island networks. A case study
   of the Caribbean island of Anguilla has been conducted. A detailed wind
   regime revealed a mean wind speed of 7.9 ms(-1) for extrapolated heights
   55 m and higher. Both analytical and modelling techniques technically
   justified the WECS with an annual production in excess of 5 GWh using
   appropriate turbines to satisfy the monthly energy generation profiles
   for Anguilla. The reliability assessment incorporated Monte Carlo
   Simulation (MCS) for outages of the generating units yielding the
   healthy, marginal and risk state probabilities. The system exhibited
   probabilities of health >= 0.999, while the LOLP <= 0.0005. The Falcon
   (1.25 MW) wind turbine yielded the best technical performance while the
   Unison U57 (0.75 MW) wind turbine was deemed suitable satisfying
   critical aesthetic requirements. An initial economic appraisal is also
   presented.

AB There is increasing recognition that habitats should be managed as part
   of fisheries management. It is generally assumed that amount of suitable
   habitat is linked to production of demersal species and that maps of
   bottom type will provide the information needed to conserve essential
   habitats. In this review, a synthesis of nursery habitat is made for
   Strombus gigas (queen conch), a large, economically important gastropod
   in the Caribbean region. Juveniles occur on a variety of bottom types
   over their geographic range. In the Bahamas, nurseries occur in specific
   locations within large, beds of seagrass, while obvious characteristics
   of the benthic environment such as seagrass density, depth and sediment
   type are not good predictors of suitable habitat. Rather, nurseries
   persist where competent larvae are concentrated by tidal circulation and
   where settlement occurs selectively. Nursery locations provide for high
   juvenile growth resulting from macroalgal production not evident in maps
   of algal biomass, and they provide for low mortality compared with
   seemingly similar surroundings. Therefore, critical habitats for queen
   conch juveniles are determined by the intersection of habitat features
   and ecological processes that combine to yield high rates of recruitment
   and survivorship. While maps of bottom type are a good beginning for
   habitat management, they can be traps without good knowledge of
   ecological processes. A demersal species can occupy different substrata
   over its geographic range, different life stages often depend upon
   different bottom types, and specific locations can be more important
   than particular habitat forms. Habitat management must be designed to
   conserve habitat function and not just form. Implicit in the concept of
   'essential habitat' is the fact that expendable habitat exists, and we
   need to prevent losses of working habitat because of inadequate
   protection, restoration or mitigation. Key nurseries may represent
   distinctive or even anomalous conditions.

AB We present the Caribbean's Virgin Islands' climate variability over the
   last 60years from indices of extreme temperature and precipitation, as
   well as their quantitative support for a recent climatic shift (1983.2
   +/- 5.5 years). The region's climate indices (defined via time series
   averages) and trends (defined via linear least squares regression
   fitting) of extreme temperature and precipitation were cross-examined
   from 1952, 1961, 1978, and 1983-2014 to diagnose: the area's climatic
   extremes; a climatic transition's role in assessing decadal climate
   anomaly rates; and to provide an analytically independent test of the
   transition's existence. Analyses relied on the use of varying physical
   constraints to include weighting from statistical and non-statistical
   uncertainties in our climatic outcomes. We report that diurnal warming
   and enhanced precipitation accompanied each interval, however,
   non-negligible deviations existed in comparisons between the same
   anomalies in any 2 intervals. Our Virgin Islands' long (1952, 1961-2014)
   versus short (1978, 1983-2014) climate variation comparisons provide
   evidence for the manifestation of decadal (or longer) shifts, and thus,
   biases, in recent Caribbean reports. Our climatic transition's overlap
   with the renowned 1976/1977 Pacific event insinuates a local Caribbean
   teleconnection, and contributes to the evidence growing globally for
   1980s' shifts in an abundance of feedback measures of Earth's energy
   budget.

AB Benthic cover, current strengths, and fish abundance and diversity were
   examined on 150 lagoonal patch reefs and mapped to determine their
   distribution, inter-relationships, and relationship to the fisheries
   closure in Glovers Reef Atoll. Current strength was highest at both the
   northern and southern ends of the atoll and largely controlled by local
   wind and weakly by tidal forcing. Benthic functional group distributions
   varied throughout the atoll and had distinct areas of dominance. In
   contrast, dominance of coral species was weaker, reflecting the lost
   cover and zonation of Acropora, Porites, and Montastraea that were
   reported in the 1970s. Hard and soft corals dominated the windward rim,
   while the central and leeward lagoon had lower current strengths and sea
   grass and fleshy green algae were relatively more abundant. Brown erect
   algae were relatively more common in the north and calcifying green and
   red algae the southern ends of the atoll. Only Montastraea-Agaricia
   agaricites distributions were similar to reports from the 1970s with
   high relative dominance in the southern and northeast atoll. The
   central-northern zone, which was described as an Acropora zone in the
   1970s, was not recognizable, and Porites porites, P. astreoides,
   Millepora alcicornis, and Favia fragum were the most abundant species
   during this survey. Hard and soft coral cover abundance declined away
   from the reef rim and tidal channels and was associated with fast
   seawater turnover and high surgeonfish abundance. Consequently, the
   windward rim area has retained the most original and persistent
   hard-soft coral and surgeonfish community and is considered a priority
   for future management, if the goal is to protect coral from fishing
   impacts.

AB Interregional encounters frequently result in dietary, health, and
   cultural changes for participating groups. This paper investigates the
   patterns and pathways of dietary change among the Mulia Dani of highland
   western New Guinea, who at the time of data collection had been in
   contact with Christian missionaries and the global food market for 29
   years. We explore three lines of data: food preferences (from survey
   responses), oral health (indicated by the percentage of carious and
   missing teeth), and dietary composition (from stable isotope ratios
   [delta C-13 and delta N-15] of hair). We assess the results alongside
   categories of village affiliation, profession, age, and sex, finding
   that different demographic subsets within Mulia differentially adopted
   new foods and food preferences. Children and communities that had
   completely abandoned their traditional subsistence strategies appear to
   have been the segments of society most likely to exhibit dietary
   changes, and preferences for meat appear to have been influenced by the
   ability of a group to acquire animal products from the missionary
   settlement. Results of this study deepen our understanding of how new
   foods and ideas entered highland New Guinea and provide a model to
   understand processes of nutritional transitions in other times and
   regions.

AB Provision of appropriate fertilizer recommendations to smallholder
   farmers is becoming increasingly important, for reasons of food
   security, economic viability, and the need to maintain soil fertility.
   Oil palm is one of the most important crops in the humid tropics, but
   smallholder growers (< 10 ha) typically have low yields, largely due to
   inadequate fertilizer inputs and/or incomplete harvesting. It is
   difficult to produce appropriate fertilizer recommendations for the
   smallholder growers, due to their large numbers and small farm sizes. In
   this work, we developed a way of transferring to smallholder growers the
   fertilizer recommendations that have been developed for nearby
   plantation fields using large fertilizer trials. The study site was in
   West New Britain Province, Papua New Guinea, and transfer of information
   was done using a geographic information system and maps of plantation
   fields, smallholder blocks, and soil types. The soil-map-unit
   descriptions were interpreted, and a unified classification system was
   derived. Then, fertilizer recommendations that had been made on a
   field-specific basis for the large plantations were allocated to soil
   types and thereby to individual smallholder blocks. In this way,
   block-specific fertilizer recommendations were made for more than 4000
   individual smallholders. The procedures used were developed into a
   conceptual framework which is transferable to other regions.
   Recommendations can be updated as new information becomes available on
   smallholder block locations or plantation fertilizer recommendations.

AB Trinidad's Northern Range is widely perceived to be suffering from acute
   watershed management problems, primarily caused by squatter farmers, who
   set uncontrolled agricultural fires, leading to destruction of
   vegetation, accelerated soil erosion, siltation and flooding in the
   valleys and adjacent urbanised plains. The policies that have arisen in
   response to this perceived environmental disaster have been shaped by
   changing attitudes towards private property within the discipline of
   watershed management, and natural resource management, more widely This
   article argues that a basic policy dispute over the issue of private
   property has been partially resolved through the construction of a
   particular social and moral category: the 'squatter'. The (re)production
   of this simplified category within contemporary policy processes has
   masked the diversity and complexity of tenurial relations on the
   Northern Range, and their relationships with wider socio-economic,
   political and environmental processes.

AB Climate change and its consequence of sea level rise are major issues
   for small island developing states (SIDS), as they worsen many other
   pressures on their people and their environment. Accordingly, articles
   in this special issue of Regional Environmental Change on SIDS address
   research gaps in the following thematic areas of the human dimensions of
   climate change. (1) Islander perceptions of climate change and the
   information sources on which these are based. (2) Migration to richer
   countries, which dominates popular media articles, so that scholars from
   a wide range of disciplines have given their perspectives on it. For
   many SIDS, however, relocation within that country is much more of an
   issue, but little studied as yet. (3) Community-based adaptation, a
   theme which only rarely appears in peer-reviewed journals. (4) National,
   regional and international policies and the effectiveness of their
   implementation. (5) Social and cultural issues arising from the above.
   This paper provides an overview of these and some related themes of
   importance to SIDS, including ocean acidification and land degradation.
   Researchers based in the SIDS and regional organisations have an
   important role in recognising these issues and in developing the local
   skills base needed to deal with them. The Paris Agreement of 2015 is a
   positive (but as yet inadequate) step towards the international action
   on climate change that SIDS need.

AB The Caribbean region is one of the five leading biodiversity hotspots in
   the world. Analysis of the spatial structure of critical habitats and
   how it affects endemic species in this region is essential baseline
   information for biodiversity monitoring and management. We quantified
   and evaluated the spatial structure and connectivity of depression
   forests on Mona Island and their potential impact on Mona Island rock
   iguana habitat, as a framework to assess spatial distribution,
   connectivity, and the issue of scale in small and widely dispersed
   habitats. Using IKONOS imagery, we mapped and delineated depression
   forests at four different scales (minimum mapping units: < 100, 100,
   500, and 1,000 m), and calculated landscape metrics describing their
   spatial structure, and connectivity, for each map resolution. Our
   approach resulted in a more detailed map than previously described maps,
   providing better information on habitat connectivity for iguanas. The
   comparison of the island landscape mapped at different scales provided
   evidence on how changing scales affect the output of spatial metrics and
   may have a significant impact when planning decisions and assigning
   conservation priorities. It also highlighted the importance of adequate
   ecological scales when addressing landscape management and conservation
   priorities. The analysis of landscapes at multiple scales provided a
   mechanism to evaluate the role of patch detection and its effect on the
   interpretation of connectivity and spatial structure of suitable areas
   for species with small and widely dispersed habitats. These
   methodologies can be applied other species, in different environments,
   with similar limitations related to connectivity and habitat
   availability.

AB Calorie malnutrition is chronic in Timor-Leste, where vitamin A
   deficiency is also common. Sweet potato (Ipomoea batatas L (Lam.)) is a
   staple in cropping in Timor-Leste, of particular importance in the diet
   as household cereal stocks dwindle. This study tested if promising
   on-station results of introduced sweet potato clones were validated
   on-farm under farmer management across a wide range of agro-ecologies
   over the 2006-2007 and 2007-2008 growing seasons using participatory
   varietal selection. Additionally, as the clones differed in tuberous
   root flesh colour we evaluated their beta-carotene content and, hence,
   potential contribution to the alleviation of Vitamin A deficiency. In
   the 2006-2007 growing season three introduced clones (later released as
   Hohrae 1,2 and 3) significantly out-performed the local by 29-45%, while
   in the next season the yields of these clones were more than double that
   of the local. Whereas only 29% of farmers gave positive comments about
   the local cultivar, 66-71% of farmers commented positively on the Hohrae
   clones. We assessed the beta-carotene content of five introduced clones,
   only light orange-fleshed tuberous roots had detectable levels of
   beta-carotene (802-1209 mu g 100 g(-1)). It was concluded that 221 g
   d(-1) - slightly less than 1 cup d(-1) - of Hohrae 3 with light orange
   fleshed roots will meet the requirement of an individual with Vitamin A
   deficiency in Timor-Leste. With an improved production potential
   combined with substantial beta-carotene, the clone Hohrae 3 has the
   potential to contribute to both calorie and Vitamin A deficits in
   Timor-Leste. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Eddy motion in the Caribbean Sea is described on the basis of sea level
   anomalies deduced from ERS-1 altimetry data corrected with
   TOPEX/Poseidon data during the 15 months of the Exact Repeat Mission
   (October 1992 to December 1993). Both cyclones and anticyclones were
   observed in the satellite data as anomalies originating in the
   Venezuelan Basin or entering the Caribbean through the Antillean
   passages, mainly the St. Lucia Channel, Anegada Passage, and north of
   Trinidad. The diameter of the eddies ranged from a few tens of
   kilometers to 700 km. Advection speeds were typically 20-30 cm s(-1) and
   the eddies were energetic (kinetic energy > 0.6 m(2) s(-2)). Their
   lifetime of 3-4 months was determined, in general, by their interaction
   with topography. Most eddy activity was eroded and disappeared at the
   Central American Rise area, although a few eddies crossed into the
   Cayman Sea through the Chibcha Channel. Some eddies also entered the
   Cayman Sea from outside the Caribbean through the Windward Passage. The
   Panama-Colombia Gyre was evident only during the tropical rainy season.
   A large cyclonic eddy was formed there during the period of maximum
   precipitation, when strong meridional salinity and wind speed gradients
   occurred. Eddy production in the central Caribbean appears to be
   associated with the interaction of the meandering Caribbean Current and
   the strong wind curl.

AB Planktonic foraminiferal census counts are used to construct
   high-resolution sea surface temperature (SST) and subsurface
   (thermocline) temperature records at a core site in the Tobago Basin,
   Lesser Antilles. The record is used to document climatic variability at
   this tropical site in comparison to middle- and high-latitude sites and
   to test current concepts of cross-equatorial heat transports as a major
   player in interhemispheric climate variability. Temperatures are
   estimated using transfer function and modern analog techniques. Glacial
   - maximum cooling of 2.5 degrees -3 degreesC is indicated; maximum
   cooling by 4 degreesC is inferred for isotope stage 3. The SST record
   displays millennial-scale variability with temperature jumps of up to 3
   degreesC and closely tracks the structure of ice-core Dansgaard/Oeschger
   cycles. SST variations in part of the record run opposite to the SST
   evolution at high northern latitude sites, pointing to thermohaline
   circulation and marine heat transport as an important factor driving SST
   in the tropical and high-latitude Atlantic, both on orbital and
   suborbital timescales.

AB This paper describes the health and nutritional status and quality of
   life (QOL) of suburban villagers in the Solomon Islands 3 y after the
   1998-2003 ethnic conflict. Cross-sectional data were obtained from a
   small community located 50 km east of the capital city (n=206, 87 adults
   and 119 children). A health survey involving urine analysis,
   anthropometry, and blood pressure measurements was conducted to assess
   health and nutritional status and child growth. Simultaneously, 57
   non-randomly selected adults participated in the QOL questionnaire
   survey. Results of anthropometry show that participants had good health
   and nutritional status (mean BMIs: 22.8 and 21.7 for men and women,
   respectively) and 73% of boys and 83% of girls were judged 'normal body
   size' based on their BMI values. Urinalysis revealed that 88% of the
   participants were healthy and indicated that they consumed considerable
   amounts of purchased food such as rice and tinned meat. These findings
   suggest that the population's lifestyle had essentially recovered from
   the ethnic conflict. However, possible consequences of the ethnic
   conflict on the QOL scores were observed in the environmental domain.
   This study found a positive association between body fat and QOL. This
   could be interpreted in terms of the traditionally positive view of
   large bodies in the South Pacific and as resulting from unstable social
   conditions prevailing after the ethnic conflict.

AB Recent theoretical advances have hypothesized a central role of habitat
   persistence on population genetic structure and resulting biodiversity
   patterns of freshwater organisms. Here, we address the hypothesis that
   lotic species, or lineages adapted to comparably geologically stable
   running water habitats (streams and their marginal habitats), have high
   levels of endemicity and phylogeographic structure due to the persistent
   nature of their habitat. We use a nextRAD DNA sequencing approach to
   investigate the population structure and phylogeography of a putatively
   widespread New Guinean species of diving beetle, Philaccolilus ameliae
   (Dytiscidae). We find that P. ameliae is a complex of morphologically
   cryptic, but geographically and genetically well-differentiated clades.
   The pattern of population connectivity is consistent with theoretical
   predictions associated with stable lotic habitats. However, in two
   clades, we find a more complex pattern of low population
   differentiation, revealing dispersal across rugged mountains and
   watersheds of New Guinea up to 430 km apart. These results, while
   surprising, were also consistent with the original formulation of the
   habitat template concept by Southwood, involving lineage-idiosyncratic
   evolution in response to abiotic factors. In our system, low population
   differentiation might reflect a young species in a phase of range
   expansion utilizing vast available habitat. We suggest that predictions
   of life history variation resulting from the dichotomy between lotic and
   lentic organisms require more attention to habitat characterization and
   microhabitat choice. Our results also underpin the necessity to study
   fine-scale processes but at a larger geographical scale, as compared to
   solely documenting macroecological patterns, to understand ecological
   drivers of regional biodiversity. Comprehensive sampling especially of
   tropical lineages in complex and threatened environments such as New
   Guinea remains a critical challenge.

AB Skeletal oxygen isotope ratios in Holocene Porites corals from northern
   Papua New Guinea record decreases in sea surface temperature (SST) and
   rainfall during El Nino events. Threshold analysis of seven fossil coral
   delta(18)O records spanning the period 7.6-5.4 ka ( thousand years ago)
   shows 8-12 El Nino events/century, significantly less than the 23
   events/century recorded by the NINO3.4 Index. The coral reconstructions
   also show a 15% reduction in El Nino event amplitude for 7.6-5.4 ka,
   compared to today, which is greater than the suppression given by model
   studies. In contrast, large and protracted El Nino events are identified
   for 2.5-1.7 ka. Taken together, the results indicate a nonlinear
   atmospheric response to Holocene changes in El Nino SST anomalies. We
   propose that small changes in tropical SST gradients, the positioning of
   the Intertropical Convergence Zone, and the Pacific tradewind
   climatology modify the impact of El Nino events on western Pacific
   rainfall.

AB Historical (PU)-P-239 activity concentrations and Pu-240/Pu-239 atom
   ratios were determined in skeletons of dated modern corals collected
   from three locations (Chuuk Lagoon, Ishigaki Island and Iki Island) to
   identify spatial and temporal variations in Pu inputs to the Northwest
   Pacific Ocean. The main Pu source in the Northwest Pacific is fallout
   from atmospheric nuclear weapons testing which consists of global
   fallout and close-in fallout from the former US Pacific Proving Grounds
   (PPG) in the Marshall Islands. PPG close-in fallout dominated the Pu
   input in the 1950s, as was observed with higher Pu-240/Pu-239 atom
   ratios (>0.30) at the Ishigaki site. Specific fallout Pu contamination
   from the Nagasaki atomic bomb and the Ivy Mike thermonuclear detonation
   at the PPG were identified at Ishigaki Island from the Pu-240/Pu-239
   atom ratios of 0.07 and 0.46, respectively. During the 1960s and 1970s,
   global fallout was the major Pu source to the Northwest Pacific with
   over 60% contribution to the total Pu. After the cessation of the
   atmospheric nuclear tests, the PPG again dominated the Pu input due to
   the continuous transport of remobilised Pu from the Marshall Islands
   along the North Equatorial Current and the subsequent Kuroshio Current.
   The Pu contributions from the PPG in recent coral bands (1984 onwards)
   varied over time with average estimated PPG contributions between 54%
   and 72% depending on location. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

AB In the late 1990s, like many other developing countries, Haiti started a
   process of devolving responsibilities over irrigation scheme management
   to water users' associations. In this paper, a three-step methodology
   for institutional analysis is applied to investigate the functioning of
   this new setting in Haiti, using three irrigation schemes managed by
   farmers as case studies. First, the institutional structures are
   described using an adapted version of the Institutional Decomposition
   and Analysis framework. Secondly, the efficiency of the institutional
   structures is assessed against a set of criteria for sustainable
   management. The combination of these two steps allows the identification
   of strengths and weaknesses, and leads to the third and final step of
   formulation of practical recommendations. Results indicate that
   authorities in Haiti had a clear vision of the reform process which was
   translated in sound objectives, a comprehensive reform methodology and
   efforts to revise the legal framework. However, the outcome of the
   reform process has been negatively affected by a perceived
   organizational deficiency, and by the absence of a functioning water
   pricing system and of clearly defined and enforceable water rights.
   Finally, similar to the situation in many other countries, the major
   constraint faced by the established water users' associations appears to
   be financial self-sufficiency.

   sequence data, in the form of mitochondrial cytochrome b sequences from
   the Plasmodium infections, showed 2 distinct clades of parasites, 1 in
   Sphenomorphus jobiense hosts and 1 in Emoia spp., which correspond to
   the 2 morphotypes. There was substantial genetic variation between the 2
   clades, as well as within the clade of Emoia parasites. Nearly half of
   the skinks sampled had green blood pigmentation, resulting from the
   presence of biliverdin in the plasma; however, only 1 of these lizards
   was infected with Plasmodium sp. and only 2 had any blood parasites.
   These preliminary results suggest a high degree of phylogenetic
   diversity but a very low prevalence of Plasmodium spp. infections in the
   skinks of this globally important biodiversity hot spot.

   log W = 2.44 log TL - 7.37, where weight (W) is in micrograms and trunk
   length (TL) is in micrometres. Instantaneous growth rates averaged
   1.7-2.5 day(-1) for the five species and were observed as high as 3.3
   day(-1). These instantaneous rates are equivalent to daily specific
   growth rates averaging 4.6-11.4 and ranging up to 28. In larger genera,
   growth rates were related positively to picoplankton and nanoplankton
   concentration, and negatively to the biomass of larvaceans, but in the
   smallest species growth was unrelated to these factors. However, because
   the variability in these two factors within microcosms exceeded their
   natural range of variability, growth rates of larvaceans may normally be
   unlimited by resources or population density effects.

   widespread throughout the survey region, with similar proportions of all
   three sibling species in both transient and permanent sites. Two members
   of the An. farauti complex, An. farauti s.s. and species no. 2, were
   found in brackish water. All breeding sites of An. punctulatus were
   cohabited by An. farauti s.l., sometimes by all three sibling species.
   Anopheles farauti s.s. was the only species collected on human bait,
   with a much higher biting rate early in the evening (57 bites/human/hour

AB On May 25th, 1992, an M-s = 6.9 earthquake occurred off the southwestern
   tip of Cuba, alone the boundary between the Caribbean and North American
   plates. This earthquake was the largest to strike southern Cuba since
   1917 and the largest ever recorded in that region by global seismic
   networks. It is therefore a key element for our understanding of the
   tectonic and kinematic regime along the northern Caribbean plate
   boundary. In order to test the previously proposed source parameters of
   the Cabo Cruz earthquake and to better constrain its focal mechanism, we
   derived a new set of source parameters from unfiltered broad-band
   teleseismic records. We used a hybrid ray tracing method that allows us
   to take into account propagation effects of seismic waves in a realistic
   crustal model around the source. Our solution is consistent with the
   long-period focal mechanism solution of Virieux er al. (1992). Our
   solution also models the higher frequency crustal and water layer
   phases. The primarily strike-slip focal mechanism has a small thrust
   component. Its shows an east-west trending nodal plane dipping 55
   degrees to the north that we interpret as the rupture plane since it
   corresponds to the geometry of the major active fault in that area. The
   displacement on this plane is a left-lateral strike-slip combined with a
   small amount of southward thrust. The result is in good agreement with
   the active tectonic structures observed along the Oriente fault south of
   Cuba. The small thrust component demonstrates that, contrary to prior
   belief, the transpressive regime extends along this whole segment of the
   Caribbean/North American plate boundary. Together with historical
   seismicity, it, suggests that most of the stress accumulated by the
   Caribbean/North American plate motion is released seismically along the
   southern Cuban margin during relatively few but large earthquakes.

AB Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd) is a fungal pathogen often
   responsible for amphibian declines worldwide. We report here survey on
   Bd in Papua New Guinea (PNG). The survey for Bd was conducted along a
   rainforest altitudinal gradient from Madang (50 m a.s.l.) to Mt. Wilhelm
   (3700 m a.s.l.). We swabbed 249 frogs of 63 native species at nine sites
   to quantify the number of Bd zoospore equivalents using real-time Syber
   Green Polymerase Chain Reaction (qPCR). We found no evidence for Bd. The
   lack of Bd may be due to 1) hot climate all year round inhibiting the
   spread of Bd in the entire lowland areas of PNG, 2) low number of
   non-native amphibian introductions to PNG such as Litho bales
   catesbeianus or Xenopus spp. or 3) the lack of invasive introductions by
   humans due to geographic isolation. While it is difficult to discern
   between these hypotheses, an effective quarantine should be devised to
   protect PNG from future disease outbreak. International assistance is
   needed in conservation education and research to assist the local
   scientists in monitoring and protecting these rich fauna from future Bd
   outbreaks.

AB The invasion of western Atlantic marine habitats by two predatory
   Indo-Pacific lionfish, Pterois volitans and P. miles, has recently
   unfolded at an unprecedented rate, with ecological consequences
   anticipated to be largely negative. We take stock of recently
   accumulated knowledge about lionfish ecology and behaviour and examine
   how this information is contributing to our general understanding of the
   patterns and processes underpinning marine predator invasions, and to
   the specific issue of lionfish management. Lionfish were first reported
   off Florida in 1985. Since their establishment in The Bahamas in 2004,
   they have colonised 7.3 million km(2) of the western Atlantic and
   Caribbean region, and populations have grown exponentially at many
   locations. These dramatic increases potentially result from a
   combination of life-history characteristics of lionfish, including early
   maturation, early reproduction, anti-predatory defenses, unique
   predatory behaviour, and ecological versatility, as well as features of
   the recipient communities, including prey naivete, weak competitors, and
   native predators that are overfished and naive to lionfish. Lionfish
   have reduced the abundance of small native reef fishes by up to 95% at
   some invaded sites. Population models predict that culling can reduce
   lionfish abundance substantially, but removal rates must be high. Robust
   empirical estimates of the cost-effectiveness and effects of removal
   strategies are urgently needed because lionfish management will require
   a long-term, labour-intensive effort that may be possible only at local
   scales. The ultimate causes of the invasion were inadequate trade
   legislation and poor public awareness of the effects of exotic species
   on marine ecosystems. The lionfish invasion highlights the need for
   prevention, early detection, and rapid response to marine invaders. (C)

AB Intensive field and model studies were undertaken into the dynamics of
   the Fly River estuary, Papua New Guinea. The estuary has three dominant
   channels forming a shallow, fan-shaped delta, and receives a mean
   freshwater discharge of approximately 6,000 m(3)s(-1) with little
   seasonal variation. The estuary is vertically well-mixed in salinity by
   strong tidal currents. The saline water is distributed unevenly between
   the channels. Model studies verified by field data suggest that this due
   to the dynamics of the estuary which are controlled by shallow water
   frictional effects that generate higher tidal harmonics, the shoaling of
   the tidal wave from the funnel shape of the estuary, a low value of the
   bottom friction coefficient resulting from the presence of fluid mud,
   and the along-channel water surface gradient. This gradient is in turn
   controlled by two dominant forcings, namely the freshwater discharge and
   the dominant offshore trade wind. This gradient is also modulated by the
   spring-neap cycle of the tidal currents which controls the low-frequency
   friction coefficient. The absence of strong cross-channel salinity
   gradients and of axial convergence zones is attributed to enhanced
   horizontal mixing by the lateral velocity shear due to the sinuosity of
   the thalweg meandering between numerous islands and shoals.

AB Central America and the western Caribbean regions form a center of
   freshwater and marine biodiversity that is increasingly becoming the
   focus of ecological and evolutionary studies. We conducted an integrated
   ecological study of Amatique Bay, Guatemala, a major estuary la goon
   connected to the low-lying Lake Izabal and to the Mesoamerican Reef
   System, and provide novel information for the management and
   conservation of similar systems across the Caribbean. Precipitation and
   wind regimes constitute important environmental drivers of ecosystem
   functioning, which partially compensate for the weak tidal-forcing that
   is characteristic of the Caribbean Sea. Seasonal peaks in temperature
   and precipitation were strongly correlated to the reproduction of
   marine, catadromous and estuarine fish species, suggesting that the
   ensuing increase in primary production provides larval fish with an
   abundant food source. Increased abundances of transient marine species
   were observed during the dry season, which may be explained by passive
   transport, feeding migration, or both, considering that prey may be more
   abundant inshore and that environmental conditions are dominated by
   higher salinity and stronger onshore winds during this period. Despite
   being a stopover site for many long-range migrating shorebird species,
   the Bay serves primarily as a resting place since it lacks extensive
   tides and tidal flats, and thus provides limited access to invertebrate
   prey. Furthermore, this sheltered environment, featuring abundant
   freshwater, seasonally high water clarity, and low tidal amplitude, is
   likely to provide good habitat for abundant seagrasses and manatees. The
   Lake Izabal-Amatique Bay complex demonstrates a wide range of
   teleconnections and connectivity among terrestrial, freshwater, and
   marine oceanic and reef ecosystems. Understanding the evolution and
   ecology underlying this highly connected system is required for the
   management of the multi-trophic, small-scale fisheries it sustains.

AB 1. The taxonomic and functional composition of reef fish assemblages are
   quantified in three biogeographical regions: Great Barrier Reef, French
   Polynesia and Caribbean. Assemblages are described in three habitats of
   differing wave exposure. Functional abilities are estimated based on
   published analyses linking fin morphology and swimming performance.
   2. Two questions were addressed: (1) To what extent are labrid
   assemblages similar among habitats and regions? (2) To what extent are
   functional characteristics of fish assemblages shaped by differences in
   biodiversity, evolutionary history and species composition?
   3. All three regions display highly congruent patterns of habitat use,
   in terms of assemblage structure and functional characteristics, despite
   a five-fold difference in species richness, limited or no species
   overlap, and a 3.2-Myear history of isolation. Exposed reef crest
   assemblages were dominated by fishes with fins reflecting lift-based
   high-speed locomotion. In contrast to abundance-based patterns, species
   presence/absence data were uninformative.
   4. The relationship between swimming ability and habitat use reveals
   underlying assembly rules at a functional level, emphasizing the utility
   of functional attributes as a metric for comparing system-level
   properties in taxonomically distinct faunas.

   reviews the Caribbean and adjacent tropical species of the genus and
   provides an identification key. Synagrops bellus, the largest species of
   the genus, reaches over 30 cm and is known from almost all the tropical
   Atlantic; it has a smooth pelvic spine and seven soft rays in the anal
   fin. Synagrops pseudomicrolepis, described from a single specimen, is
   reported from the western and southern Caribbean; it is similar to S.
   bellus in having a smooth pelvic spine, but differs by its nine anal-fin
   soft rays. Synagrops spinosus has a widely disjunct distribution,
   including the tropical and temperate western Atlantic, and Chinese and
   Japanese waters; it has a serrated pelvic spine and anal-fin counts of
   II,7-8. Synagrops trispinosus, an almost strictly Caribbean species,
   also has a serrated pelvic spine, but its anal-fin counts are III,8-9.

AB Beaches are frequently subjected to erosion and accretion that are
   influenced by coastal development interventions and natural variations
   due to storms and changes in river flow. Climate change may also
   exacerbate beach erosion and accretion. Natural scientists are concerned
   with the sustainability of species dependent on the beach ecosystem.
   Policymakers are pre-occupied with the economic sustainability of
   coastal communities should species decline and prolonged beach loss
   occur. The aim of this paper is to explore the linkage between science
   and policy by reporting the findings of a study of coastal change
   impacts on leatherback turtle nesting and analysing the socio-economic
   and adaptation implications of these changes for coastal communities.
   Grande Riviere, Trinidad, was used as a case study. Primary fieldwork
   investigated unsustainable coastal management practices. A questionnaire
   was administered to examine livelihoods, including ecotourism based on
   leatherback turtle nesting, and knowledge and awareness of climate
   change. One key finding of the study was that the community's
   livelihoods were natural resources dependent, and that natural beach
   dynamics and unsustainable coastal management practices posed major
   threats to natural resource and economic sustainability. Another key
   finding was that, despite these impacts, community knowledge and
   awareness of climate change in general was low, and there was a
   perception of state responsibility for climate change adaptation. The
   research findings have global applicability for coastal communities at
   risk of exposure and that are highly vulnerable to natural resources
   damage arising from anthropogenic stress and potential climate change.
   These communities require policy reforms to strengthen current coastal
   management practices and adaptation responses aimed at ensuring
   long-term sustainability.

AB The authors have been conducting research with the aim of developing
   methods to preserve and effectively use groundwater resources. This
   research has been ongoing since 2008 with the focus on Laura Island,
   Majuro Atoll, Republic of the Marshall Islands. Examination of the
   groundwater level potentials in pre-existing observation wells at Site
   No. 6, named by the United States Geological Survey (USGS), showed no
   difference in the groundwater level potential along the depth.
   Accordingly, observation well No. 6-N was established by boring to
   accurately observe the profiles of electric conductivity (EC) of
   groundwater. However, salt water intrusion occurred, contrary to the
   observed results for the groundwater level potential. Accordingly, the
   depth of the salt water intrusion was identified by developing a double
   packer, observation well No. 6-N was partially sealed and the sealing
   effect on the observation well was confirmed. This paper will discuss 1)
   the measures against salt water intrusion which occurred in the
   observation well, 2) the groundwater flow in an observation well, which
   was established to measure electric conductivity (EC) profiles of the
   groundwater, and 3) the depth of the groundwater path estimated by
   measuring EC profiles with a double packer in the observation well.

AB This article is the next study in a series of papers that documents the
   diversity of a unique, special, and characteristic cyanobacterial
   microflora of alkaline wetlands of Central America (northern Belize). We
   describe and document the variability, life cycles, and ecology for 36
   distinct coccoid morphospecies. Taxonomic determination of these species
   is based on morphological phenotype and ecological preference of
   uncultured specimens. The coccoid cyanobacteria are among organisms
   forming cyanobacterial mats, and as such are an important ecological
   component of the extensive calcareous wetland ecosystems of the Yucatan
   peninsula. They develop primarily in the benthos and on submerged stems
   of wetland vegetation (mainly Eleocharis spp.). They eventually get
   released from submersed substrata and become floating mats at the
   water's surface. Cyanobacterial mats are typified by precipitation of
   calcareous mart, and they often fix atmospheric nitrogen. The taxonomic
   diversity of phenotypically distinguishable morphotypes is extraordinary
   high (about 80 traditional species were registered), and many of them
   are probably characteristic for similar ecosystems in the whole
   Caribbean region (Cuba, Jamaica, SE Mexico, Nicaragua, Puerto Rico,
   Florida [USA], Venezuela). The majority of species are clearly different
   from all cyanobacterial morphotaxa described thus far from other
   habitats and/or regions. Of the 36 cyanoprokaryotic coccoid taxa
   discussed in this paper, 10 are described as new species following the
   rules and requirements of the International Code of Botanical
   Nomenclature, as the simplest starting point for future research.
   Ecological characteristics are used as an integral part of our taxonomic
   determinations.

   RP-HPLC-APCI(+)-MS/MS in 22 cocoa liquors from 11 different countries. A
   very large range of concentrations was observed for trans-piceid. The
   most concentrated sample (Arriba 06) reached 0.4 and 2.6 mg/kg of
   trans-resveratrol and trans-piceid, respectively, but in other cultivars
   stilbene levels were five times lower. Neither cis-resveratrol nor
   cis-piceid was found in cocoa liquors. An unknown compound eluting 0.5
   min before trans-piceid and present at concentrations up to 0.8 mg/kg of
   trans-piceid equivalents in cocoa liquors was tentatively identified by
   HRMS as a trans-piceid-like hexoside.

AB Despite the fact that recruitment can significantly influence the
   population dynamics of benthic marine populations, relatively Little is
   known about the biological and physical processes controlling
   recruitment. We selected eight closely related coral reef fishes
   (wrasses in the family Labridae) to examine the temporal and spatial
   patterns of juvenile recruitment to the Caribbean island of Barbados. We
   used a comparative approach to study the relationships among patterns of
   recruitment, early Life history traits, and aspects of the physical
   environment. For 10 wk during each of three peak recruitment (spring)
   seasons (1990-1992), we used a biweekly census of recently settled
   juveniles (8-25 mm standard length, SL) to measure the abundance of six
   congeners, Halichoeres bivittatus, H. radiatus, H. poeyi, H. garnoti, H.
   pictus, and H. maculipinna, and two confamilial labrids, Thalassoma
   bifasciatum and Bodianus rufus. Analysis of the otoliths of a sample of
   collected specimens provided estimates of larval durations,
   postsettlement ages, sizes at settlement, and juvenile growth rates,
   enabling back-calculation of settlement day for all collected juveniles.
   We compared temporal patterns of recruitment among species, and spatial
   patterns of recruitment for the most common species.
   Temporal patterns of recruitment were consistent among seasons for most
   of the labrids examined, although the magnitude of recruitment was less
   predictable (particularly for H. poeyi, H. maculipinna, and B. rufus).
   The eight labrids could be divided into two groups based on their early
   Life history traits and within-season temporal patterns of recruitment.
   Halichoeres bivittatus, H. radiatus, H. poeyi, H. garnoti, and H. pictus
   had larval durations that were relatively short and invariant (means of
   23-27 d), and all settled at fairly large sizes (9-12 mm SL) during the
   new moon and first maximum amplitude tide. In contrast, T. bifasciatum,
   B. rufus, and H. maculipinna had larval durations that were longer or
   more variable, and all three were able to delay metamorphosis. These
   three species settled at relatively smaller sizes (8-10 mm SL) during
   the third-quarter moon and second minimum amplitude tide. We compared
   temporal patterns of T. bifasciatum recruitment between Barbados and
   Caribbean Panama in an attempt to identify further the proximate
   environmental cues operating during settlement. Contrasting patterns of
   T. bifasciatum recruitment between the two geographical locations
   probably result from differences in the relative timing of the lunar and
   tidal amplitude cycles. Recruitment of labrids to Barbados occurred
   along the entire west coast of the island. Although some labrids had
   rather specific habitat requirements (e.g., B. rufus associated
   exclusively with large seaward-facing coral heads such as Montastrea
   spp.), most species were ubiquitous along the west coast.
   Species-specific juvenile densities did not often vary significantly
   among sites following major recruitment events, although overall
   densities were generally lower at a central site. Lower recruitment to
   that site likely results from reduced rates of larval supply due to
   prevailing offshore tidal flows.
   Thus, temporal and spatial patterns of labrid recruitment to Barbados
   appear to be more predictable than previously thought for reef fishes.
   In particular, variation in the tidal amplitude cycle may influence both
   the timing of settlement and, to a lesser degree, the spatial scale of
   larval supply. Finally, the interaction of larval biology with such
   physical processes is evident in the correlation between temporal
   patterns of recruitment and early life history traits. The functional
   nature of this relationship clearly warrants further study.

AB While one-to-one specificity between reef-dwelling hosts and symbiotic
   dinoflagellates of the genus Symbiodinium may occur, detailed
   examination of some hosts reveals that they contain multiple symbiont
   types. Individuals of the foraminifer Amphisorus hemprichii living in
   Papua New Guinea contained mixed communities of Symbiodinium dominated
   by symbiont types in clades C and F. Moreover, the types showed a
   distinct pattern in their distribution across the radius of the
   foraminifer, with clade F Symbiodinium more prevalent in the center of
   the host cell. The mixed community of symbionts and their pattern of
   distribution within the foraminifer is likely the result of processes
   happening both inside the foraminifer and in its external environment.
   Persistent mixed symbiont communities in foraminifera may be stabilized
   through benefits conferred by maintaining multiple symbiont lineages for
   symbiont shuffling. Alternatively they may be stabilized through a
   heterogeneous internal host environment, partitioning of symbiont
   functional roles or limitation of symbiont reproduction by the host. Six
   factors generally determine the presence of any particular symbiont type
   within a foraminifer: mode of transmission, availability from the
   environment, recognition by the host, regulation by the host,
   competition between lineages, and fitness of the holobiont.

AB The Bermuda Islands lie in the western Atlantic Ocean with the closest
   mainland being North Carolina, some 965 km to the west. The islands have
   undergone considerable change since permanent settlement around 1612 and
   this has affected their freshwater habitats which now are limited to
   small lakes (variously influenced by saltwater intrusion), ponds and
   drainage ditches. Although there exist some patchy records of freshwater
   invertebrate taxa, going as far back as 1859, there had been no single
   attempt to survey a variety of habitat types across the islands. The
   latter was done in 1990-1992 and the results are reported here. Because
   of the proximity of many sites to the coast, this survey reports some
   species with brackishwater tolerance, and also, as in the case of the
   mites, species that were riparian in distribution. The samples revealed
   a total of 51 fresh/brackish water species, with 24 of these being
   recorded from the islands for the first time. Predominant amongst this
   fauna were oligochaetes, gastropods, microcrustaceans, peracarids,
   odonates, corixids, hydrophilid beetles, and chironomid, ceratopogonid
   and ephydrid dipterans. Based on distributional records in the
   literature, it is concluded that these freshwater taxa have colonised
   the islands primarily from the southwest (from the Caribbean and Gulf of
   Mexico regions), likely carried by the prevailing northeasterly winds
   and the Gulf Stream. There are, however, other taxa whose sources must
   lie in the North American continent, particularly on its eastern
   seaboard. A single species, the brackishwater chironomid Halocladius
   stagnorum, seems to have colonised from source areas along the coast of
   the eastern Atlantic, possibly via ocean-going vessels.

AB Mild protein-calorie malnutrition is common in Western Samoa.  Severe
   protein-calorie malnutrition is also an important cause of death in
   infants and toddlers, and anemia is frequently found in small children. 
   This paper investigates child feeding practices because of its possible
   relationship with the occurrence of severe early malnutrition.  Data on
   infant and toddler feeding practices were collected from 90 mothers from
   the town of Apia and 38 mothers from the island is Savai'i.  Average age
   of mothers in Apia was 29.0 years and in Savai'i, 30 years.  Most
   belonged to the low income group.  Average interval between births in
   Apia was 22.3 months, in Savai'i, 25.7 months.  The proportion of
   bottlefed children was much lower in Savai'i than in urban Apia, 28.2
   vs. 57.9%.  31.3% of Apian mothers weaned their last child abruptly
   compared with 41.6% of Savai'i mothers.  In Apia, weaning foods
   consisted of milk, meat, and other protein-rich foods; in Savai'i, taro,
   orange leaf tea, rice, and other were the main weaning foods. 
   Generally, semisolids were not introduced before the child was more than
   6 months of age.  Some mothers in Savai'i appeared to give their
   children monotonous diet.  A number of cultural taboos appear to affect
   the children's diet as well as that of pregnant and lactating mothers. 
   Many women believed in them and would not eat or do certain things. 
   Overall, it appears that many of the mothers are ignorant about the
   nutritional needs of their children.  Almost 7% of the 0-5 year old
   children suffered from borderline malnutrition.  9% of the total number
   of admissions during the period October 1968 to April 1972 were
   malnourished children.  The increase in borderline malnutrition and
   severe malnutrition among the children towards the end of the 1st year
   is attributed mainly to the late introduction of semisolid and solid
   foods.  Other causes of malnutrition include lack of money, especially
   in urban areas, large families, changes in the diet because of higher
   consumption of imported foods (soft drinks, refined foods), decline in
   breastfeeding, and increase in early bottlefeeding.

   were able to correctly identify the functions of teeth and cariogenic
   foods, and were also aware of the signs of periodontal disease. However,
   they incorrectly defined the meaning of dental caries and dental plaque.
   Also students claimed good oral hygiene behaviour and willingness to
   receive necessary treatment for a carious tooth from a dentist. Sixty
   five per cent of children and 74 per cent of adolescents, went to a
   dentist at some time and were likely to receive extraction at their last
   visit. Cost and fear were found to be the common barriers for regular

AB It is a widely held concept that tropical coral reefs in shallower water
   with branched acroporid corals should accrete faster than those in
   deeper water dominated by massive corals. Results from a study of
   Holocene development of the largest Atlantic reef system, including
   paleo-waterdepth data, challenge these concepts. In Belize barrier and
   atoll reefs, reef accretion-rates range from 0.46 to 7.50 m/kyr, and
   average 3.03 m/kyr, as measured along 33 dated reef sections.
   Interestingly, accretion-rates increase with increasing
   paleo-waterdepth, and sections dominated by massive corals accumulated
   even slightly faster than those with branched acroporids. Published data
   from some other reef locations reveal no significant trends when
   plotting reef accretion-rate versus paleo-waterdepth, also indicating
   that the above-mentioned concepts should be questioned. Massive corals
   apparently are more resistant and accrete in lower disturbance
   conditions in slightly deeper water (5-10 m) and higher accomodation
   (space available for sediment deposition) as compared to shallow water
   (0-5 m) branched acroporids, which repeatedly get broken and leveled out
   during tropical cyclones.

AB We incorporated oceanic emissions and atmospheric chemistry of
   dimethylsulfide (DMS) into the hemispheric Community Multiscale Air
   Quality model and performed annual model simulations without and with
   DMS chemistry. The model without DMS chemistry predicts higher
   concentrations of sulfate (SO42-) over land compared to the low
   concentrations over seawater. Including DMS chemistry substantially
   increases (SO42-) concentrations over seawater and many coastal areas.
   It enhances the annual mean surface (SO42-) by >0.8 mu g/m(3) in some
   areas of the Pacific Ocean, Atlantic Ocean, Arabian Sea, and Caribbean
   Sea. The largest enhancement occurs in summer in which DMS chemistry
   increases surface (SO42-) by 70% over seawater. The model without DMS
   chemistry underestimates the summer-time observed (SO42-) in the U.S.
   while the model with DMS chemistry improves model performance in the
   U.S. coastal areas.

AB Water hyacinth (Eichhornia crassipes) was first found in PNG in the
   early 1960s. By the late 1980s, it had spread to a number of locatioins
   including the Lower Sepik River, East Sepik Province, where it was
   expanding rapidly and causing serious' problems for the Lower Sepik
   River communities. An AusAID funded biological control programme, from
   1993 to 1998, resulted in four biological control agents, the weevils
   Neochetina eichhorniae and N. bruchi, and the pyralid moths Niphograpta
   albigut- talis and Xubida infusellus being released. The two weevil
   species caused significant reductions of the weed in PNG while the moth
   X. infuseltus established at one site only with no impact. The second
   moth N. albiguttalis did not become established. We review the biology
   of each insect, the introductions, release strategies and monitoring for
   these biological control agents, especially the three that are now part
   of the PNG biota.

AB Several problems of acute lead poisoning children have been identified
   over the past three years in Trinidad. In all cases investigated so far,
   continual exposure to lead from battery recycling or from lead-smelter
   washes have been found responsible. In East Trinidad, illicit dumping of
   lead wastes from such sources has resulted in several sites becoming
   heavily contaminated. Some of these sites are in environmentally
   sensitive areas, including rivers and wetlands, and require urgent
   remedial action. Results of monitoring studies at several of these sites
   show lead levels as high as 75% by weight. The potential for surface and
   ground water contamination exists, as evidenced by leaching of lead into
   surrounding areas.

AB Pseudophoenix ekmanii, P.lediniana and P.vinifera (Arecaceae) are
   endemic to Hispaniola. The more wide-ranging P.sargentii also occurs on
   the island. Population genetic diversity and structure of Pseudophoenix
   was investigated using ten microsatellite loci. The study focused on
   populations from Hispaniola, but also included samples from other
   Caribbean islands. Results showed homozygote excess and high inbreeding
   coefficients in all populations across all polymorphic loci. Populations
   were highly differentiated. Results from both Bayesian and
   neighbour-joining cluster analyses identified groups that were
   consistent with currently accepted species delimitations. We included
   the only known population of a possible undescribed taxon from the
   Dominican Republic. Results from the cluster analyses suggested that
   this putative taxon is closely related to P.sargentii from the Turks and
   Caicos Islands. There was no significant correlation between population
   size and observed heterozygosity. Contrary to what was anticipated,
   protected areas do not harbour most of the genetic diversity of the
   genus. The Haitian endemic P.lediniana should have the highest priority
   for conservation because it is restricted to a single population, it has
   a small number of individuals and it exhibited reduced levels of genetic
   diversity. The putative new taxon from the Dominican Republic has
   similar conservation concerns. Future conservation efforts should aim to
   maintain population connectivity and increase population size,
   particularly targeting populations with low genetic diversity.(c) 2014

AB This paper describes the food and feeding mechanisms of the bathyal
   brisingid sea-star Novodinia antillensis (A. H. Clark, 1934). N.
   antillensis is shown to be an opportunistic suspension feeder capable of
   capturing living planktonic crustaceans of a wide range of sizes. The
   sea-star extends its 10 to 14 arms into water currents to form a feeding
   fan with a large surface area, and uses highly retentive pedicellaria on
   the lateral arm spines to grasp and retain prey. The flexible arms form
   arm loops to complete the capture. The pedicellaria have a structure
   very similar to that used by other species known to capture macroscopic
   prey and, although they are an order of magnitude smaller, they probably
   function in a similar manner.

AB The shallow marine hydrothermal vents near Ambitle Island in eastern

   reduced fluid into cool, slightly alkaline, oxygenated seawater.
   Gradients in temperature, pH, and total As (AS(T)), among others, are
   established as the two aqueous phases mix. The hydrothermal fluid
   contained similar to 900 mu g/L AS(T), almost exclusively present as the
   reduced As-III, while local seawater measured between 1.2 and 2.4 mu g/L
   As, with approximately equal levels of As-III and As-V. Of particular
   interest in this study was As speciation and abundance in pore waters as
   a function of sediment depth and as a function of distance from the area
   of focused venting. With increasing distance, As-T concentration in the
   pore water decreased rapidly, but remained elevated up to 300 m from the
   area of focused venting when compared to a non-hydrothermal control
   site. As a function of depth (to similar to 100 cm) AS(T) concentration
   in the pore water profiles was elevated and generally increased with
   depth. Surprisingly, aqueous As-V far exceeded aqueous As-III at almost
   all distances and depths investigated, while at the control site the
   As-III concentration exceeded that of As-V. In the Tutum Bay
   hydrothermal system, chemical disequilibria among As species provide
   potential metabolic energy for arsenite oxidizing microorganisms where
   hydrothermal fluid mixes with seawater near the vent orifice, and for
   arsenate reducing microorganisms with increasing distance and depth from
   the hydrothermal point source. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

   arms) was censused over 4 yr (1987 to 1990) in a lagoonal population of
   Ophioderma brevispinum (Say) (Ophiodermatidae) at Belize, and over 3 yr
   (1988 to 1990) in back-reef populations of O. appressum (Say) at Belize
   and Jamaica. The Jamaican population was sampled in sheltered and
   wave-exposed areas. Over the study period, the frequency of injuries
   within populations did not differ significantly, nor did the 2 O.
   appressum populations show consistent differences. Arm injuries were
   more common in the 3 living populations (30 to 74% injured) than in a
   Lower Jurassic population composed of 2 ophiodermatid species (0%
   injured) from a similar warm-water habitat. The incidence of sublethal
   disk damage was negligible in all cases. Hurricane-generated rubble
   movement did not cause any detectable damage to either the protected or
   exposed Jamaican O. appressum subpopulations. Predation is the primary
   source of arm injuries in living Ophioderma spp. This study supports the
   hypothesis that predation on ophiuroids increased when durophagous
   teleostean fishes and decapod crustaceans diversified in the late
   Mesozoic.

   in augmentation technologies has resulted in their successful deployment
   worldwide. This paper proposes that innovative electric generators

   available in the Madan community of Jiwaka Province, Papua New Guinea.
   Portability, low production costs, ease of on-site assembly, and
   recycling of available materials are emphasized as the key design
   parameters in construction of the suggested augmented generators. The
   working principles and economics of the technologies are discussed along
   with suggestions for overcoming cultural barriers to electrification in

AB In Timor-Leste, customary institutions contribute to sustainable and
   equitable rural development and the establishment of improved access to
   and management of land, water and other natural resources. Drawing on
   multi-sited empirical research, we argue that the recognition and
   valorization of custom and common property management is a prerequisite
   for sustainable and equitable land tenure reform in Timor-Leste. In a
   four-community study of the relationship between land access and the
   practice of rural livelihoods in eastern and western districts of
   Timor-Leste, where customary management systems are dominant, we found
   different types of traditional dispute resolution, with deep roots in
   traditional forms of land management and with varying levels of
   conflict. The article shows how customary land tenure systems have
   already managed to create viable moral economies. Interviewees expressed
   a desire for the government to formalize its recognition and support for
   customary systems and to provide them with basic livelihood support and
   services. This was more important than instituting private landholding
   or state appropriation of community lands, which is perceived to be the
   focus of national draft land laws and an internationally supported
   project. We suggest ways in which diverse customary institutions can
   co-exist and work with state institutions to build collective political
   legitimacy in the rural hinterlands, within the context of upgrading the
   quality of rural life, promoting social and ecological harmony, and
   conflict management.

AB The monthly averaged freshwater discharge data from ten rivers in
   northern Colombia (Caribbean alluvial plain) draining into the Caribbean
   Sea were analysed to quantify the magnitudes, to estimate long-term
   trends, and to evaluate the variability of discharge patterns. These
   rivers deliver similar to 340.9 km(3) yr(-1) of freshwater to the
   Caribbean Sea. The largest freshwater supply is provided by the
   Magdalena River, with a mean discharge of 205.1 km(3) yr(-1) at Calamar,
   which is 26% of the total fluvial discharge into this basin. From 2000
   to 2010, the annual streamflow of these rivers increased as high as 65%,
   and upward trends in statistical significance were found for the
   Mulatos, Canal del Dique, Magdalena, and Fundacion Rivers. The
   concurrence of major oscillation processes and the maximum power of the
   3-7 year band fluctuation defined a period of intense hydrological
   activity from approximately 1998-2002. The wavelet spectrum highlighted
   a change in the variability patterns of fluvial systems between 2000 and
   2010 characterised by a shift towards a quasi-decadal process (8-12
   years) domain. The Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ), El Nino -
   Southern Oscillation (ENSO) events, and quasi-decadal climate processes
   are the main factors controlling the fluvial discharge variability of
   these fluvial systems. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB A mass mortality event of the long-spined sea urchin Diadema antillarum
   (Philippi, 1845) occurred during 1983-1984 across the western Atlantic.
   Recovery to pre-mortality densities has been slow throughout most of the
   Caribbean as current stocks remain low, existing at a small fraction of
   previously recorded levels. To measure population recovery at Puerto
   Rico, we surveyed 26 localities around the island during 2003-2004. At
   each reef, we deployed 15 x 2 m belt transects (n = 12) to detect and
   quantify the presence of D. antillarum and obtain data on benthic cover.
   Density of D. antillarum varied significantly among geographic regions
   and localities, though variability was high. The highest density was
   documented in the Culebra Island region (0.44 ind m(-2)), followed by
   the northern region of Puerto Rico (0.23 ind m(-2)). No individuals of
   D. antillarum were found in 11 of the 26 surveyed localities. These
   densities are still substantially lower than pre- and post-mortality
   estimates from Puerto Rico. Most of the reefs were characterized by high
   macroalgal cover and horizontal water transparency < 3 m. Urchin

AB Variations in the stable isotopic composition of benthic foraminifera
   from Deep-Sea Drilling Project (DSDP) site 502B in the Caribbean Sea are
   used to reconstruct Atlantic intermediate water circulation variability
   over the last 1.2 m.y. Comparison of this record with other North
   Atlantic benthic isotope records indicates that Atlantic intermediate
   water circulation was relatively enhanced during glacial maxima when
   North Atlantic deep water (NADW) production was reduced. However, a
   simple, compensatory relationship between intermediate and deepwater
   circulation is not apparent. Geochemical models have shown that such
   changes in ocean circulation can affect atmospheric CO2 levels by
   changing vertical nutrient and alkalinity profiles. The Delta delta C-13
   difference between Caribbean site 502B and deep equatorial Pacific site
   677 is highly coherent and in phase with ice volume. Like the delta O-18
   record, there is an increase in amplitude (40%) and a large increase in
   100 kyr power after 0.7 Ma. The 1.2 parts per thousand Delta delta C-13
   amplitude scales to 70 ppmV in atmospheric CO2 using Boyle's (1986) box
   model result. The implied increase in CO2 amplitude after 0.7 Ma may
   suggest a positive feedback role in effecting the higher-amplitude
   climatic fluctuations which characterize the last 0.7 m.y.

   proposed by the Government of Mauritius. Its dependency on rainfall is
   investigated. The revamping of existing hydropower facilities to attain
   higher efficiency is also analyzed. Pumped hydropower is found to be a
   possible solution to the problem of peak electricity demand in
   Mauritius. This will reduce the need for investing in fossil-fuel-based
   power generation. However, its capital investment can be high and cases
   have to be considered on their specific merits. Recommendations are made
   to optimally exploit the limited potential of hydropower in Mauritius.

AB Effective management of migratory sea turtles requires informed and
   sustained collaboration among range states. The primary objective of the
   Wider Caribbean Sea Turtle Conservation Network's regional Marine Turtle
   Tagging Centre at the University of the West Indies, Barbados, has been
   to encourage and enable such collaboration, uniting otherwise isolated
   sea turtle tagging programs to benefit from information on the
   geographic range of sea turtles tagged in one country and captured,
   sighted, or stranded in another country. We present the first summary of
   information gleaned from international tag returns of adult female
   hawksbill sea turtles (Eretmochelys imbricata) marked with Marine Turtle
   Tagging Centre tags. Twenty-one sea turtle projects in 19 countries and
   overseas territories received Inconel 1005-681 tags from the Marine
   Turtle Tagging Centre between January 2002 and June 2009, and 12 of
   these projects have reported tagging adult female hawksbills, for a
   combined total of 2261 tagged individuals. Sixty-three of these
   individuals (2.8%), sighted at least once in another country since being
   tagged, have been reported to the Marine Turtle Tagging Centre; the
   majority of them (96.8%) were originally tagged while they were nesting
   in Barbados. Based on minimum straight-line distance traveled, the point
   of capture averaged 343.9 +/- 69.7 km standard error (SE), (median 175
   km) from the nesting beach. The average number of days between tagging
   and the first recapture was 835 +/- 67.9 days SE, median 860 days).
   Although the majority of returns came from within a few hundred
   kilometers of the tagging site, tagged animals often passed through
   multiple exclusive economic zones and were exposed to conflicting
   management regimes, which include legal and illegal sea turtle
   fisheries. The shallow continental shelf off the coasts of Nicaragua and
   Honduras was confirmed as a foraging ground for Eastern Caribbean
   hawksbills.

AB Plutonium analyses of a dated coral record from the French Frigate
   Shoals in the central North Pacific indicate that there are two major
   sources of Pu in this basin: close-in (tropospheric) fallout from
   nuclear weapons testing at the Pacific Proving Grounds in the Marshall
   Islands in the 1950s and global (stratospheric) fallout which peaked in
   1962. Furthermore, the Pu-240/Pu-239 atom ratio of fallout from the
   Pacific Proving Grounds is characteristically higher (0.24) than that of
   global fallout Pu (0.18-0.19). Seawater and sediment samples from the
   North Pacific exhibit a wide range of Pu-240/Pu-239 values (0.19-0.34),
   with a trend towards higher ratios in the subsurface waters and
   sediment. Deep water Pu-240/Pu-239 ration are higher in the vicinity of
   the Marshall Islands relative to stations further from this close-in
   fallout source. These preliminary data suggest that fallout Pu from the
   Pacific Proving Grounds is more rapidly removed from the surface waters
   than is global fallout Pu. Plutonium geochemistry appears to be related
   to the physical/chemical form of Pu-bearing particles generated by
   different fallout sources. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science Limited.

AB Stable isotope ratios (C-13 and N-15) were analyzed from the bone
   collagen of individuals (n=8) from a Lapita burial ground (ca. 2800-2350
   BP) on Watom Island, located off northeast New Britain in the Bismarck
   Archipelago. The aim of this study was to assess the diet and
   subsistence strategies of humans that lived during the later Lapita
   period in Near Oceania. To aid in the interpretation of the human diet
   we analyzed the stable isotope ratios of faunal material from the site
   (n=27). We also aim to assess methods of animal husbandry at the site
   over time from an analysis of the stable isotope ratios (C-13 and N-15)
   of pig bones (n=22) from different temporal periods (Lapita,
   post-Lapita, and late prehistoric). The protein diet of the humans
   consisted of marine organisms from the inshore environment and some
   deep-water species, most likely marine turtle, in addition to higher
   trophic level terrestrial foods, likely pig and native animals (e.g.,
   fruit bat, Cuscus and bandicoot). Although the sample sizes were small,
   females (n=4) displayed more variable C-13 and N-15 values compared with
   males (n=4), which may be associated with the movement of adult females
   to the island. The stable isotope analysis of the pig bones indicated
   that there were few differences between the diets of the pigs from the
   Lapita and post-Lapita layers, suggesting that the method of pig
   husbandry was similar between these two periods and was likely
   relatively free-range. Am J Phys Anthropol 157:30-41, 2015. (c) 2015

   Florida, the Bahamas, and the West Indies, and E. worsfoldi from the
   Bahamas and the West Indies. Where possible, rib counts were made on
   each shell whorl to allow for ontogenetic changes. Epitonium phymanthi
   lives with and feeds on the sea anemone Phymanthus crucifer in Florida
   (where E. lamellosum and another epitoniid Opalia crenata also live with
   this anemone). Likewise, E. worsfoldi lives with and feeds on a
   sand-dwelling anemone that is either Actinoporus elegans or
   Homostichanthus duerdeni in the Bahamas. There it is more commonly
   parasitic on another anemone, Stichodactyla helianthus. Aquarium
   observations on E. phymanthi with E. lamellosum revealed some major
   biological differences between these co-occurring species, e.g. fully
   everted proboscis lengths and speed of movement. Epitonium phymanthi was
   found with E. worsfoldi at only one locality, as shells in the Virgin

AB The number of coral diseases, coral species they infect, number of
   reported cases, and range over which these diseases are distributed have
   all increased dramatically in the past 3 decades, posing a serious
   threat to coral reef ecosystems worldwide. While some published studies
   provide data on the distribution of coral diseases at local and regional
   levels, few studies have addressed the factors that may drive these
   distributions. We recorded coral disease occurrence, prevalence, and
   severity along with temperature, sedimentation, and coral population
   data (species abundance and colony size) over 2 consecutive summers on
   reefs near Lee Stocking Island (LSI) in the Bahamas' Exuma Chain. In
   2002 a total of 11 092 coral colonies (all species present) were
   examined within a survey area of 9420 m(2), and 13 973 colonies within
   10 362 m(2) in 2003. Similar to other reports, relatively large,
   framework species including Siderastrea siderea, Colpophyllia natans,
   and Montastraea annularis, along with the smaller Dichocoenia stokesi,
   were the species most susceptible to coral disease. Recurring infections
   were observed on individual colonies from 2002 to 2003, and were more
   likely for black band disease (BBD) than for either white plague (WP) or
   dark spots syndrome (DS). In 2002, WP and DS demonstrated clumped
   distributions, while BBD was randomly distributed. However, in 2003 BBD
   and WP were clumped. This is the first study, to our knowledge, that
   quantitatively documents coral disease dynamics on reefs surrounding
   LSI.

AB A sample survey of children under 2 years of age was carried out in Port
   Moresby in March 1979 by a group of final year medical students.  Its
   purpoose was to assess the impact of the recently introduced (July 1977)
   legislation restricting the sale of feeding bottles.  The same areas
   were selected as those in a 1976 survey, and the sampling techniques and
   questionnaires were similar.  Of the 149 children under 2 years sampled,
   127 were breastfed, 17 were artifically fed, and 5 were excluded as they
   were receiving no milk at all.  Thus, 88% of the children were breastfed
   compared with 65% of children in the 1976 survey.  This difference is
   highly significant (p0.01).  32% of the children had weights for age
   below the 80% line compared with 41% of children in the 1976 survey. 
   This difference was not statistically significant.  Only 1 mother of the
   17 who were artificially feeding their babies had obtained a feeding
   bottle illegally.  The most common reason given for artificial feeding
   was that the mother was working.  There has been a highly significant
   increase in the prevalence of breastfeeding in Port Moresby between 1976
   and 1979.  It is considered that the legislation introduced in July 1977
   restricting the sale of feeding bottles has been of major importance in
   promoting the increase in breastfeeding.

   sediments do not store substantial dissolved CH4 late in the year, the
   degassing of these sediments by Hurricane Sandy did not play an
   important role in the annual carbon emissions from this marsh.

AB Over the last 30 years, successive researchers have portrayed occupation
   in the highlands of New Guinea during the Pleistocene, or prior to the
   advent of agriculture, to have been based on hunting and the
   exploitation of seasonally-producing high-altitude Pandanus spp. (karuka
   in pidgin). The reporting of high-altitude Pandanus dating to c.
   31-30,000 uncal. BP from the Kosipe Mission site (Owen Stanley Range,
   Papua New Guinea) has breathed new life into this scenario. However,
   such portrayals are based on long-held and simplistic assumptions
   regarding Pandanus phenology, vegetation history and resource
   availability in the highlands during the Pleistocene. I advance an
   alternative interpretation which highlights the spatial and temporal
   variability in the seasonality of Pandanus production, the persistence
   of mixed Castanopsis-Lithocarpus lower montane forest on the lower
   slopes and floors of some highland valleys during the Pleistocene, the
   resultant variability in abundance and diversity of plant food resources
   across space and through time, and the highly variable food procurement
   strategies adopted by people inhabiting the interior of New Guinea
   during the Pleistocene.

AB Studies of food and interaction webs are often simplified by combining
   different species of predator into guilds, especially predators that are
   closely related. Such combinations require the assumption that predators
   are functionally redundant or at least have similar effects on prey
   abundances and community structure. However, few studies have rigorously
   tested this assumption, particularly with exploited species of marine
   predators. Moreover, fishing can strongly alter the relative abundances
   of different predatory species, further highlighting the need to examine
   the top-down effects of different predators on lower trophic-level
   species within marine communities. Throughout the greater Caribbean,
   intensive fishing has depleted populations of Nassau grouper Epinephelus
   striatus, while populations of the less-targeted coney Cephalopholis
   fulva have proliferated. In the present study I experimentally tested
   the effects of these different grouper species on recruitment of other
   coral-reef fishes to spatially isolated reefs. Recruitment to reefs
   occupied by Nassau grouper was similar to that on predator-free control
   reefs, and both treatments accumulated higher relative recruit abundance
   and diversity than reefs occupied by coney. Thus, even closely related
   predator species can have substantially different effects on lower
   trophic levels. Shifts in dominance of predatory species may therefore
   lead to dramatic changes to prey communities. These findings underscore
   the importance of addressing both the direct and indirect effects of
   fishing on marine communities.

   number of species was registered in Serranilla Bank (341), followed by
   New Shoal (242) and Alice Shoal (122). Fishes were the most
   representative group with 135 species. Seven exclusive species were
   found in Alice Shoal, 42 in New Shoal and 128 in Serranilla Bank. 18
   species were registered with endangered categories at a global and

AB This article examines the mechanisms of subsistence adaptation of two
   Papua New Guinea populations, the Metroxylon sago-depending lowland
   Gidra and the taro-monoculture Mountain Ok, surviving in low population
   densities of 0.5 and 1.4 persons per km2. Observation of the groups'
   land use systems strongly suggests that their population densities have
   not been far below the carrying capacity, although the territory of each
   population is markedly heterogeneous. Both groups have maintained their
   sustainable food production not only for resource management but also
   for survival at a population level, either expanding their territory or
   changing the sustainable level in tandem with changes of subsistence
   system.

AB Microbial communities associated with black band disease (BBD) on
   colonies of the reef building coral Siderastrea siderea from reefs in 3
   regions of the wider Caribbean were studied using 16S rRNA gene-targeted
   amplification, cloning, and sequencing. Samples were collected from 7
   BBD-infected S. siderea colonies on 2 reefs near Lee Stocking Island,
   Bahamas, one reef in the Florida Keys, Florida, USA, and 2 reefs in St.
   Croix, US Virgin Islands. Genomic DNA extracted from BBD samples was
   PCR-amplified with universal bacterial primers (27F and 1492R). Seven
   clone libraries were constructed and 411 sequences were retrieved. All
   of the clone libraries were dominated by Alphaproteobacteria and
   contained sequences associated with bacteria of the sulfur cycle,
   including the first report of the molecular detection of sequences
   related to the sulfide-oxidizing genus Beggiatoa in BBD field samples.
   Additionally, all clone libraries had sequence types of bacteria
   associated with toxin producing dinoflagellates. These sequences were
   most abundant in a sewage impacted reef site in St. Croix, which also
   had the highest prevalence of BBD-infected colonies. Non-metric
   multidimensional scaling and cluster analysis showed clustering of BBD
   microbial communities by relative level of anthropogenic impact. The
   results support the hypothesis that BBD is composed of variable members
   of distinct physiological and toxin associated bacterial groups and that
   the microbial community variation is associated with environmental
   differences such as anthropogenic impact. We propose that with degrading
   water quality (i.e. increasing nutrients) certain proteobacteria thrive
   and increase BBD virulence.

AB The evolutionary relationships of the surface genera of shrimps of the
   family Atyidae from the Caribbean were inferred using mitochondrial 16S
   ribosomal DNA and cytochrome oxidase I gene sequences. The genetic
   divergence among the 4 Caribbean genera (Atya, Jonga, Micratya,
   Potimirim) is extensive and dates from between the Eocene and Miocene.
   This result suggests a vicariant origin or the ancient dispersal of some
   taxa. Most intrageneric divergences date to the late Miocene-Pliocene
   and, thus, are probably the result of dispersal. Some species show low
   levels of intraspecific genetic divergence between distant islands, and
   thus, present-day or geologically recent gene flow is likely. This gene
   flow is probably a consequence of the amphidromous life histories of
   most Caribbean freshwater shrimps. Despite the ancient divergences
   between the genera, the Caribbean surface atyids form a single
   evolutionary lineage when compared with atyid shrimp from throughout the
   world, and this result implies an ancient evolutionary radiation in the
   Caribbean. The sister group to the Caribbean atyids are the large-bodied
   and robust Atya-like shrimps of the Indo-Pacific, which share a similar
   size and shape with Caribbean Atya. Thus, the common ancestor probably
   was also large and robust. In contrast, the other Caribbean atyids are
   much smaller, and Jonga has a distinct morphology that is associated
   with a switch from lotic to lentic environments. This radiation may have
   been the result of the absence from the Caribbean of other small shrimps
   that are common in the Indo-Pacific.

   efforts; (3) the distribution of specimen records among families,

   contained 168,487 specimen records belonging to 7146 species. The
   specimen records showed uneven distribution among families, genera,
   species, growth forms and countries. Although there was some species
   overlap between and among countries, unique species were collected in
   each country. Despite the high collecting efforts, many areas still
   remain under-collected.

AB The St Lucia estuarine lake is the largest in Africa and has recently
   experienced a freshwater-deprivation crisis, partly because its
   connection with the large Mfolozi catchment has been discontinued. This
   is due to the extremely high silt load carried by the Mfolozi waters. A
   study was undertaken during 2012 with the aim of determining the effect
   of high silt loads on the mortality and feeding rates of Acartiella
   natalensis, a key copepod species in the St Lucia Estuary. Two different
   types of experiments were conducted: one using natural organic silt to
   determine the effect of turbidity on mortality rate; and the other with
   inorganic silt to determine feeding rates. For the mortality
   experiments, the copepods were subjected to six different turbidity
   levels, ranging from ambient to 2500 NTU, with survival monitored at 0,
   4, 24, 48, and 72 hour time intervals. For the feeding experiments,
   copepods were incubated in the same turbidity levels for a 24 hour
   period. Results revealed a significant effect of turbidity on both
   feeding and mortality, with lowest ingestion rates and survival recorded
   in the high turbidity treatments. These findings indicate that overall,
   this copepod species is negatively affected by high turbidities, but an
   unexpectedly high mortality rate was recorded under control conditions
   (6-38 NTU). The lowest mortality rate occurred at 500 NTU, suggesting
   that while very high silt loads (>1000 NTU) clearly interfere with the
   physiological functioning of A. natalensis, some sediment may be
   advantageous, perhaps as a supplementary source of nutrition. (C) 2013

AB During the Mitch Hurricane event (October 1998), severe floods occurred
   in the village of La Trinidad (Departamento de Esteli, NW Nicaragua),
   which spreads at the margin of La Trinidad river. As a consequence, the
   need for hazard assessment and land use planning to reduce the effects
   of these natural processes arose. Nicaragua is a developing country,
   which means that there is a scarcity of good quality data on which to
   base these hazard assessments (i.e., lack of detailed topographic maps,
   lack of meteorological and discharge data series). Therefore, the main
   objective of the present work was to generate a flood hazard map of La
   Trinidad by means of a simple method, with a resulting map easy to
   understand and to use by the municipality for land use planning. There
   is no topographic map of the area at a more detailed scale than
   1:50,000. So the main document that supports all the data and on which
   the final hazard map was based is the orthophotograph at 1:5,000 scale
   (generated from vertical aerial photographs taken in 2000). The method
   used was based on classical interpretation of vertical aerial
   photographs (pre Mitch and a post Mitch event), detailed field work,
   inquiries among the population and analysis of the main pattern of
   storms occurring in the area. All these data allowed the reconstruction
   of different extensions and water levels corresponding to events of
   different frequency and magnitude, and the qualitative association of
   them to three hazard levels by means of energy and frequency. The use of
   orthophotographs of 1:5,000 proved to be very useful both for the
   development of the work and for the presentation of the final map,
   because they are very easily understandable for people not trained in
   the interpretation of topographic maps.

   study has applied a system Generalized Method of Moment with a two-step
   estimator involving a panel of twenty middle and lower-middle income
   economies for the period 1990 to 2015. The results indicate that fossil
   fuel consumption, oil imports and urbanization expansion are
   significantly contributing to environmental degradation. The outcomes
   have also confirmed the reversed U-shaped relationship between carbon
   emissions and per capita growth. The findings determine that the use of

AB Cloud optical properties in the trade winds over the eastern Caribbean
   Sea have been shown to be sensitive to cloud condensation nuclei (CCN)
   concentrations. The objective of the current study was to investigate
   the CCN properties in the marine boundary layer (MBL) in the tropical
   western North Atlantic, in order to assess the respective roles of
   inorganic sulfate, organic species, long-range transported mineral dust
   and sea-salt particles.
   Measurements were carried out in June-July 2013, on the east coast of
   Barbados, and included CCN number concentrations, particle number size
   distributions and offline analysis of sampled particulate matter (PM)
   and sampled accumulation mode particles for an investigation of
   composition and mixing state with transmission electron microscopy (TEM)
   in combination with energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX).
   During most of the campaign, significant mass concentrations of
   long-range transported mineral dust was present in the PM, and influence
   from local island sources can be ruled out. The CCN and particle number
   concentrations were similar to what can be expected in pristine marine
   environments. The hygroscopicity parameter kappa was inferred, and
   values in the range 0.2-0.5 were found during most of the campaign, with
   similar values for the Aitken and the accumulation mode. The
   accumulation mode particles studied with TEM were dominated by
   non-refractory material, and concentrations of mineral dust, sea salt
   and soot were too small to influence the CCN properties. It is highly
   likely that the CCN were dominated by a mixture of sulfate species and
   organic compounds.

   was recorded for the first time west of the Mount Hagen massif. It
   presumably ranges westward at high elevations to the Strickland Gap. The
   Ribbontailed Astrapia (Astrapia mayeri) was common from 2,117 m at Lake
   Tawa to 3,200 m at Omyaka Camp. We did not encounter Stephanie's
   Astrapia (Astrapia stephaniae). Its westernmost range extension must lie
   east of Porgera valley in the north, although it extends west to the
   Doma Peaks/Tari Gap area in the south. The Crested Bird of Paradise
   (Cnemophilus macgregorii) was not encountered on this survey, but one
   local informant at Omyaka Camp stated that it was present and it was
   collected during a 1989 survey (Kula 1989). It appears that this species
   is rare or absent between the Hagen/Giluwe area and the Star Mountains
   of Papua (Indonesia). This provides an intermediate- stage example of
   Diamond's "drop-out" phenomenon (Diamond 1972). The Kaijende Highlands
   support a rich upland bird fauna that might best be conserved through
   the creation of a large contiguous community-managed reserve that
   encompasses uninhabited traditional hunting lands. This could serve as a
   useful biodiversity offset for the Porgera mine operation

   explore the phylogeography of A. argentata in the Caribbean as a part of
   the multi-lineage CarBio project, through mtDNA haplotype and
   multi-locus phylogenetic analyses. The history of the Argiope argentata
   lineage in the Caribbean goes back 3-5 million years and is
   characterized by multiple dispersal events and isolation-by-distance. We
   find a highly genetically distinct lineage on Cuba which we describe as
   Argiope butchko sp. n. While the argentata lineage seems to readily
   balloon shorter distances, stretches of ocean still act as filters for
   among-island gene-flow as evidenced by distinct haplotypes on the more
   isolated islands, high FST values, and strong correlation between
   intraspecific (but not interspecific) genetic and geographic distances.
   The new species described here is clearly genetically diagnosable, but
   morphologically cryptic, at least with reference to the genitalia that
   typically diagnose spider species. Our results are consistent with the
   intermediate dispersal model suggesting that good dispersers, such as
   our study species, limit the effect of oceanic barriers and thus
   diversification and endemism.

   stypohydroperoxide (5)] along with five known compounds from the marine

   planar structures of compounds 1-5 were determined by extensive
   spectroscopic analysis (1D and 2D NMR, LRMS, HRMS, IR, and UV), while
   relative configuration was determined by 1D and 2D NOE experiments.
   X-ray crystallography confirmed the relative configuration of 2 beta,3
   alpha-epitaondiol (1), and the modified Mosher's ester method was used
   to establish its absolute configuration. All of the new metabolites were
   moderately toxic to murine neuro2a cells (LC50 2-25 mu M), and three [2
   beta,3 alpha-epitaondiol (1), flabellinol (2), and flabellinone (3)]
   possessed potent sodium channel blocking activity. Stypotriolaldehyde
   (4) had a biphasic effect on the concentration of intracellular Ca2+ in
   rat cerebellar granule neurons (CGN). The previously known compound,
   stypoldione (6), also modulated intracellular calcium concentration and
   was cytotoxic in CGN. Metabolites 2 beta,3 alpha-epitaondiol (1),
   flabellinol (2), and flabellinone (3) displayed moderate cytotoxicity to
   the NCI-H460 human lung cancer cell line.

AB Oligotrichids and choreotrichids are ciliate taxa contributing to the
   multi-step microbial food web and episodically dominating the marine
   microzooplankton. The global diversity and distribution of aloricate
   Oligotrichea are unknown. Here, the geographic ranges of the 141
   accepted species and their synonyms in marine and brackish sea water are
   analyzed, using hundreds of taxonomical and ecological studies; the
   quality of the records is simultaneously evaluated. The aloricate
   Oligotrichea match the moderate endemicity model, i.e., the majority
   (94) of morphospecies has a wide, occasionally cosmopolitan
   distribution, while 47 morphospecies show biogeographic patterns: they
   are restricted to single geographic regions and probably include 12
   endemic morphospecies. These endemics are found in the Antarctic, North
   Pacific, and Black Sea, whereas the "flagship" species Strombidinopsis
   cercionis is confined to the Caribbean Sea. Concerning genera, again
   several geographic patterns are recognizable. The species richness is
   distinctly lower in the southern hemisphere than in the northern,
   ranging from nine morphospecies in the South Pacific to 95 in the North
   Atlantic; however, this pattern is probably caused by undersampling.
   Since the loss of species might affect higher trophical levels
   substantially, the aloricate Oligotrichea should not any longer be
   ignored in conservation issues. The ecophysiological diversity is
   considerably larger than the morphological, and even tops the richness
   of SSrRNA and ITS haplotypes, indicating that probably more than 83-89%
   of the diversity in aloricate Oligotrichea are unknown. The huge
   challenge to discover all these species can only be managed by combining
   the expertises of morphological taxonomists, molecular biologists,
   ecologists, and physiologists.

AB Siliceous drift pumice was collected from a total of 40 beaches around
   the main island of New Caledonia, Southwest Pacific, in order to
   determine its provenance. New Caledonia is enclosed by a barrier reef
   lagoon whose 2008 designation as a UNESCO World Heritage Site brought
   attention to the environmental degradation caused by a century of open
   cast nickel mining. The frequent, voluminous pumice eruptions in the
   Southwest Pacific provide ample source material that is somewhat
   durable, highly transportable in water, and easy to collect and analyze.
   Geochemical and mineralogical analyses were used to identify the source
   of the pumice in order to map the transport vector across the open ocean
   and into the lagoon. Drift pumice was sampled during 2008 and 2010. The
   mineral assemblage of the pumice was consistently calcic plagioclase,
   clinopyroxene, orthopyroxene, and opaque minerals. All of the pumice was
   of fairly uniform geochemistry: low in mafic elements, low in alkalis,
   with LILE enriched compared to HFSE, and negative Eu, Ti, and Zr
   anomalies. The pumice is predominately dacitic and tholeiitic. This
   geochemical signature was consistent with published data from the Tonga
   arc, which is further supported by the mineralogy. With the exception of
   two samples (which probably came from either the Kermadec arc or
   Vanuatu) all of the pumice comes from the Tonga arc. The samples from
   2008 are consistent with pumice erupted from Metis Shoal in 2006, and
   the majority of 2010 samples are consistent with pumice erupted from an
   unnamed volcano (0403-091) that erupted in 2001.

AB The objective of this study was to outline the epidemiology of Ciguatera
   fish poisoning as seen in a general practice serving two industrial
   seaports in Trinidad and Tobago, in order to highlight the potential
   public health implications. A retrospective study was undertaken of all
   the cases of Ciguatera fish poisoning identified between November 1,
   1992 and October 31, 1998 in a seaport general practice to identify
   signs, symptoms and treatment. An investigation of one outbreak was
   undertaken. Four outbreaks affecting 42 male ship crewmembers were
   identified. The suspect fish were caught in northern Caribbean waters en
   route to Trinidad and Tobago. The most common early symptoms were
   diarrhoea, vomiting, abdominal cramps, pruritus and tiredness. In the
   third outbreak, dysaesthesia was common. Progression to muscular
   weakness, ataxic gait, unsteadiness and other neurotoxic signs were seen
   in moderate to severe disease. Hypotension was an important prognostic
   sign in the initial case. Treatment was symptomatic and supportive and
   included vitamins B-12 and B-CO, folic acid, prostigmine, steroids and
   antihistamines as indicated. In the investigation of the second
   outbreak, the relative risk of 'eating fish meat' was 5 (95% Cl 1.45,
   17.27, p < 0.0001). Abdominal symptoms, pruritus, and muscle weakness
   with a history of consuming a fish-meal were diagnostic indicators of
   'ciguatera fish poisoning.' All cases were industrial ship crewmembers.
   It is suggested that increased clinician awareness with early and
   appropriate treatment, and focussed public health intervention may help
   limit the potential public health impact of ciguatera poisoning in
   industrial ship crewmembers and other fish-consuming communities in the
   future.

AB Resuming earlier work, this study explores the circulation mechanisms of
   rainfall variations in Central America and the Caribbean during
   19211986. Regarding interannual variability, correlation analysis shows
   as favourable for abundant rainfall in the region warm surface waters,
   low pressure, upward motion, and weak tradewinds on the Atlantic side
   and over the eastern Pacific enhanced southerlies and a northward
   displaced intertropical convergence zone. In the course of the twentieth
   century, the region experienced alternations between protracted and
   contrastingly extreme regimes of rainfall, from wet 19311938 to dry
   19391947 to wet 19501956 to dry 19711978. Changes in circulation
   patterns from the dry to the wet regimes are in the sense of
   correlations in interannual variability, pattern changes being broadly
   inverse in the evolution from the wet to the dry regimes. The
   alternations between contrasting circulation and rainfall regimes are
   reflected in changing lake levels. The study exemplifies the information
   value of a novel circulation data set. Copyright (c) 2012 Royal

AB Processes shaping the distribution of foliar fungal endophyte species
   remain poorly understood. Despite increasing evidence that these cryptic
   fungal symbionts of plants mediate interactions with pathogens and
   herbivores, there remain basic questions regarding the extent to which
   dispersal limitation and host specificity might shape fungal endophyte
   community composition in rainforests. To assess the relative importance
   of spatial pattern and host specificity, we isolated fungi from a sample
   of mapped trees in lowland Papua New Guinea. Sequences of the internal
   transcribed spacer (ITS) region were obtained for 2079 fungal endophytes
   from three sites and clustered into molecular operational taxonomic
   units (MOTUs) at 95% similarity. Multivariate analyses suggest that host
   affinity plays a significant role in structuring endophyte community
   composition whereas there was no evidence of endophyte spatial pattern
   at the scale of tens to hundreds of metres. Differences in endophyte
   communities between sampled trees were weakly correlated with variation
   in foliar traits but not with tree species relatedness. The dominance of
   relatively few generalist endophytes and the presence of a large number
   of rare MOTUs was a consistent observation at three sites separated by
   hundreds of kilometres and regional turnover was low. Host specificity
   appears to play a relatively weak but more important role than dispersal
   limitation in shaping the distribution of fungal endophyte communities
   in New Guinea forests. Our results suggest that in the absence of strong
   ecological gradients and host turnover, beta diversity of endophyte
   communities could be low in large areas of contiguous forest.

AB For many small island nations, fisheries provide residents with both
   food security and economic stability. However, in order to create
   effective and sustainable fisheries policies and management that will
   ensure a growing population can prosper, policy makers need to know what
   is being fished and how much is fished. Vanuatu, the smallest country in
   Melanesia, has a declared and claimed Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) of
   over 820,000 km(2) and fisheries resources play a large part in the food
   security and economic stability of this country. This reconstruction of
   the total marine fisheries catch of Vanuatu for 1950-2014 faced major
   data gaps. It showed that the reconstructed total catches of nearly 1.4
   million tonnes (metric tons) 40% higher than the 977,997 tonnes reported
   by the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAQ) on behalf of Vanuatu for
   the same period. However, if large-scale industrial catches are
   excluded, the reconstructed small-scale fisheries catches (similar to
   270,000 tonnes) were over 200% higher than the 114,862 tonnes of
   reported catch that were assumed to represent the small-scale sector in
   FAO data. Subsistence catches made up almost 93% of small-scale catches,
   followed by artisanal and recreational catches with similar to 7 and
   <1%, respectively. By continuously improving the fisheries data of
   Vanuatu for both the past and the present, policy makers, stakeholders,
   and fishers can make better decisions that will maintain the benefits of
   marine fishery resources.

AB Aim Anthropogenic land-use change is a major driver of the current
   extinction crisis, but the processes through which it acts on
   biodiversity are complex and still poorly understood. Here, we use
   several biodiversity metrics to make a comprehensive assessment of the
   response of an endemic-rich bird assemblage to land-use change. Location
   SAo Tome Island (SAo Tome and Principe, Africa). Methods We sampled bird
   assemblages in 220 point counts, stratified across three regions and
   four land-use types. Species richness was examined using accumulation
   curves and generalized linear mixed-effect models. Compositional and
   structural changes were analysed with ordination techniques. We used
   correlations and model selection to identify species traits and
   environmental variables associated with such changes. Results At the
   point level, there was a slight decrease of species richness in more
   intensive land uses. However, higher dissimilarities within these land
   uses led them to have higher overall species richness. Endemics
   dominated forest environments and, although most preferred
   less-disturbed land uses, many persisted across all land uses.
   Non-endemics were virtually absent from forests, but became very
   abundant in the more intensive land uses. Canopy cover was the best
   predictor of the shift between endemic and non-endemic species, and
   allowed identifying regional differences in the local responses of bird
   assemblages to land-use change. Main conclusions To better understand
   biodiversity, it is crucial to use several metrics simultaneously. In
   SAo Tome, simply using species richness, the single most used
   biodiversity metric, could have been misleading as it concealed major
   shifts in the bird assemblage structure towards an endemism impoverished
   avifauna. Despite scarce data on land-use cover, we demonstrate how
   landscape context can be vital to understand biodiversity patterns and
   that highly forested surroundings might overestimate the strict value of
   more intensive land uses. Our results raise concerns about the long-term
   persistence of endemic species restricted to islands where forested land
   uses are being lost.

AB Settlement of the Caribbean spiny lobster, Panulirus argus on artificial
   substrates was studied from September 2003 to April 2004 at Bimini,
   Bahamas. The small scale, shallowness, and distinctive current regime of
   Bimini make it a more readily interpretable recruitment system regarding
   species with complex life cycles. Spatiotemporal patterns of pueruli
   settlement on "Witham-type" collectors were examined monthly by sampling
   over three specific days scheduled around each new moon. Peak abundances
   of pueruli were found in September, November, and February, but with
   considerable spatial heterogeneity.
   The western portion of Bimini Lagoon, open to the ocean, revealed higher
   abundances of lobster larvae, while absence of pueruli at the broad
   eastern entrance, open to the shallow Great Bahama Bank, suggested
   little contribution to settlement in the Bimini nursery. This region
   apparently is primarily dependent on postlarvae supplied by the Gulf
   Stream. Pueruli settlement varied significantly over the three sampling
   days, occurring mostly 3 d before new moon, which differed from peak
   settlement times in other regional studies. Significantly smaller total
   lengths of postpueruli in the innermost section of the lagoon (i.e., the
   North Sound) suggest poorer environmental conditions at this site,
   probably reflecting poor food and shelter availability. Nevertheless,
   higher abundances of older juveniles in the North Sound demonstrated
   that this area has an ecologically important habitat for recruitment of
   spiny lobster to subsequent ontogenetic stages. The importance of
   recruitment processes for the successful management of this commercially
   exploited species is discussed.

AB The January 2010 earthquake in Haiti caused catastrophic damage, and the
   displacement of about 1.5 million people in urban and peri-urban areas
   of Port-au-Prince. A web-based questionnaire was developed and sent to
   international organizations working in Haiti through the Water,
   Sanitation and Hygiene (WASH) Cluster in order to assess how
   humanitarian actors responded to the sanitation needs for Internally
   Displaced People (IDP). The findings showed different sanitation systems
   being implemented during humanitarian relief and the transition to the
   reconstruction/development phase. Humanitarian practitioners faced
   specific challenges to sanitation provision related to the urban type of
   the emergency response. However, experts' opinions highlighted
   innovative solutions that have not been implemented in the field, due
   mostly to land tenure issues, donors' restrictions and lack of political
   will. Practitioners provided some suggestions for more resistant
   sanitation technologies as well as some recommendations for sanitation
   provision in the early recovery phase.

AB The authors report on a finding that annual U. S hurricane counts are
   significantly related to solar activity. The relationship results from
   fewer intense tropical cyclones over the Caribbean and Gulf of Mexico
   when sunspot numbers are high. The finding is in accord with the
   heat-engine theory of hurricanes that predicts a reduction in the
   maximum potential intensity with a warming in the layer near the top of
   the hurricane. An active sun warms the lower stratosphere and upper
   troposphere through ozone absorption of additional ultraviolet (UV)
   radiation. Since the dissipation of the hurricane's energy occurs
   through ocean mixing and atmospheric transport, tropical cyclones can
   act to amplify the effect of relatively small changes in the sun's
   output thereby appreciably altering the climate. Results have
   implications for life and property throughout the Caribbean, Mexico, and
   portions of the United States.

AB Overwater dispersal and subsequent allopatric speciation contribute
   importantly to the species diversity of West Indian Anolis lizards and
   many other island radiations. Here we use molecular phylogenetic
   analyses to assess the contribution of overwater dispersal to
   diversification of the Anolis carolinensis subgroup, a clade comprising
   nine canopy-dwelling species distributed across the northern Caribbean.
   Although this clade includes some of the most successful dispersers and
   colonists in the anole radiation, the taxonomic status and origin of
   many endemic populations have been ambiguous. New mitochondrial and
   nuclear DNA sequences from four species occurring on small islands or
   island banks (Anolis brunneus, Anolis longiceps, Anolis maynardi, Anolis
   smaragdinus) and one species from the continental United States (A.
   carolinensis) are presented and analysed with homologous sequences
   sampled from related species on Cuba (Anolis allisoni and Anolis
   porcatus). Our analyses confirm that all five non-Cuban species included
   in our study represent distinct, independently evolving lineages that
   warrant continued species recognition. Moreover, our results support
   Ernest Williams's hypothesis that all of these species originated by
   overseas colonization from Cuban source populations. However, contrary
   to Williams's hypothesis of Pleistocene dispersal, most colonization
   events leading to speciation apparently occurred earlier, in the late
   Miocene-Pliocene. These patterns suggest that overwater dispersal among
   geologically distinct islands and island banks is relatively infrequent
   in anoles and has contributed to allopatric speciation. Finally, our
   results suggest that large Greater Antillean islands serve as centres of
   origin for regional species diversity.

AB Background: Overweight and cardiovascular risk factors are a common
   phenomenon in seafarers. According to internal observation particularly
   crew members from the Pacific Island State of Kiribati are exposed to a
   high risk. However, in mixed crews, cultural background plays an
   important role, influencing food choice, and the actual risk.
   Methods: The Seafarer Nutrition Study (SeaNut study) compared dietary
   factors in 48 Kiribati and 33 European male seafarers recruited from
   four merchant ships with a high level of Kiribati manning within a
   German shipping company. Analysis encompassed the assessment of dietary
   quality on board, satisfaction with prepared dishes, and individual food
   intake obtained from 24-h recalls in comparison with nutritional
   recommendations.
   Results: The overall supply of meat, fat and eggs was more than double,
   whereas the proportions of fruits, vegetables, dairy products and
   cereals were much lower than recommended. Based on the reported food
   choices, both groups, but notably Kiribati seafarers, did not reach
   reference values as to macronutrient, micronutrient and fiber intake. In
   addition, satisfaction with the meals served, food preferences and
   knowledge about a healthy diet varied markedly between Kiribati and
   Europeans.
   Conclusions: The present analysis of the SeaNut study revealed the
   necessity of future health intervention programs, including the quality
   of the food supply as well as information about a healthy diet and
   adequate food selection. In mixed crews, culture-specific differences
   should be considered, in order to facilitate the long-term success of
   interventions.

AB This paper examines the process through which a region was enacted and
   politically mobilized at the tenth meeting of the Conference of the
   Parties (CoP10) to the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD). We draw
   on concepts from scalar politics and new regional geography, data
   collected as part of a collaborative event ethnography of CoP10, and
   interviews with Palauan delegates to theorize the enactment of an
   oceanic Pacific Region as a scalar strategy directed toward transcending
   the practical and imagined smallness of Pacific small island developing
   states (SIDS) within the CoP10 meeting context and global imaginations.
   We conclude that the Pacific Region construct enhances Pacific SIDS'
   capacity to participate in CoP10, although their collective influence
   remains relatively limited compared with others. Most significantly, the
   Pacific Region imaginary of a vast ocean space and network of people
   committed to the CBD and biodiversity conservation positions Pacific
   Islanders to play a pivotal role in conserving a significant portion of
   the world's oceans. In the context of increasing global attention to
   marine conservation, the enactment of such a Pacific Region is likely to
   aid in attracting international recognition, attention, and support. By
   conveying how and why a diverse group of state and nonstate actors
   enacted an international and oceanic region at CoP10, we contribute
   understanding of strategic regionalization within the scalar politics
   literature and further disrupt understandings of an ontologically given,
   land-based region conceptualized on continental or subcontinental
   spatial scales.

AB We describe the reproductive system and morphological expression of
   imposex in the marine gastropod Gemophos viverratus (Kiener, 1834) for
   the first time. This species can be used as a bioindicator of
   tributyltin (TBT) pollution on the west coast of Africa, a region for
   which there is a lack of information regarding levels and impacts of TBT
   pollution. Adult G. viverratus were collected between August 2012 and
   July 2013 in Sao Vicente Island (Republic of Cabo Verde), at pristine
   sites on the northeastern and eastern coasts and at Porto Grande Bay,
   the major harbour in the country. All the females (n = 81) caught
   outside the bay were normal, but 99% (n = 108) of those collected inside
   the bay exhibited degrees of abnormal virilization. Seven levels of
   imposex intensity, from stage 0 (normal) to stage 6 (sterilized
   females), are described following at least three different pathways of
   evolution (a, b and c). Female sterilization was caused mainly by
   abnormal growth of 'tumour-like' tissues in the oviduct. A peculiar
   characteristic of imposex in this species is the development of a distal
   prostate by females, resembling the same organ exhibited by males. In
   the laboratory, imposex could be artificially induced by injecting very
   small doses of TBT into females, demonstrating that TBT is a causative
   agent of this syndrome.

AB Prorocentrum minimum is a planktonic dinoflagellate known to produce red
   tides that can be harmful. To recognize localities and understand
   occurrences of Prorocentrum minimum blooms in Mexico, published data of
   plankton from 1942 to present, as well as unpublished data from the
   authors, were reviewed. Studies and reports covered marine and coastal
   waters of Mexico during different periods. Presence of P. minimum were
   reported in the Pacific coast, Gulf of California, Gulf of Mexico, and
   the Caribbean, but blooms have been only reported since 1990. Thirteen
   bloom events were recorded. Six occurred in shrimp ponds and seven near
   aquaculture regions or coastal areas where intensive agriculture is
   practiced. Most of the blooms can be associated with damage to the
   surrounding marine biota either in aquaculture ponds or open waters.
   Direct toxicity has not been fully evaluated, but data suggest that low
   oxygen may not easily explain all of the damage. Interestingly, for yet
   unknown reasons, cells belonging to the triangular morphotype have
   seldom been reported in Mexico. (C) 2004 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB High rates of soil erosion are a serious problem in Haiti. Donor-funded
   projects and nongovernmental organizations have promoted a wide variety
   of soil and water conservation practices. Despite the magnitude of the
   problem and the amount invested, there are relatively few economic
   analyses of the long-term adoption of these practices. We use an
   economics approach to examine the utilization of conservation practices
   by smallholder farmers in central Haiti using cross-sectional data
   covering 600 households. The adoption of conservation structures that
   include live plants and those that are made with other materials is
   examined as simultaneous decisions made by households in the sample. The
   results show that plot and household characteristics have different
   effects on utilization across different classes of soil practices,
   particularly with regard to perceived soil quality, market access, and
   household health status. Higher rates of use for some practices are
   associated with better soil, market access, and improved health status.
   These results inform the design and targeting of new programs related to
   soil and water conservation, such as those that include conservation
   agriculture practices.

   approximately 9000 m2, over a coral terrain with sandy patches, in
   depths of 6 to 26 m. Observations were recorded with video and still
   cameras in the Red Sea. Courtship consisted of close pairing, then an
   ascending swim (3 to 8 m high) led by the female, with the pair in close
   contact. At the apex, gametes were released as a conspicuous cloud. Nine
   to 31 (xBAR=17) minutes after spawning, the pair retired for the night
   into the same burrow, usually within one minute of each other. During
   the day the pair stayed within 10 m Of each other for 90% and within 4 m
   for 57% of the time observed as they foraged over their large territory.
   There was no evidence of burrow construction and haremic social units,
   and the male shares the entire territory with only one female.

AB Corallita (Antigonon leptopus) is a perennial vine, lauded as an
   ornamental for its vigorous growth, and plentiful (usually) pink
   flowers, and even its ability to smother unsightly landscapes. In the
   United States it thrives in horticultural zones 8 to 10, and also is
   successfully grown worldwide in tropical climates. When corallita is
   neglected, it can grow quickly over other vegetation, spreading beyond
   its area of introduction. Once established, it is difficult to eradicate
   because it produces many tuberous roots that can propagate vegetatively.
   Its fruits are buoyant, allowing for successful seed dispersal in water.
   The islands of Guam (South Pacific Ocean) and St. Eustatius (Caribbean
   Sea) represent two regions where corallita has become so pervasive that
   it threatens local diversity. In Florida, already it is classified as a
   Category II invasive. Our report reviews the literature and past studies
   of corallita, in addition to adding new taxonomic and distribution
   information from herbarium specimens to clarify the identity and
   geographic range. It is recommended that introductions of this plant by
   the horticultural industry in both tropical and temperate regions be
   closely monitored to prevent spread. On tropical island nations, we
   advise against: any new introductions.

AB The varied monthly precipitation data of stations across Costa Rica are
   assigned to one of five regions, each of which displays a distinct
   precipitation regime. Peaks and troughs in each regional regime reflect
   the relative contribution and timing of the major precipitation-bearing
   winds flowing from the Pacific, the Caribbean, and continental North
   America. Lag cross-correlations with a Southern Oscillation index reveal
   different regional associations, and at differing times, with
   fluctuating atmosphere-ocean conditions in the tropical Pacific.
   Patterns of correlations are coherent within each region, but display
   interregional differences that are more marked than previously
   suggested. The Pacific coast experiences drought shortly before and
   during the onset of an ENSO event. The Caribbean coast receives
   increased summer precipitation but decreased winter rains during these
   episodes. The interior regions of the country display a mixed response
   to these events. In the years following a warm phase ENSO the signs
   change abruptly as the cold ENSO phase sets in, indicating a more
   complex sequence of environmental changes than a simple, single drought.
   This is most pronounced along the Caribbean coast, where the summer and
   winter seasonal rainfall exhibit opposing associations to the same
   atmosphere-ocean conditions.

AB Aruba, located close to the coasts of Colombia and Venezuela, is one of
   the most densely populated islands in the Caribbean and supports a wide
   range of marine-related socio-economic activities. However, little is
   known about the impacts of human activities on the marine environment.
   Injuries in marine mammals can be used to examine interactions with
   human activities and identify potential threats to the survival of
   populations. The prevalence of external injuries and tooth rake marks
   were examined in Atlantic spotted dolphin (Stenella frontalis) (n =
   179), bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops truncatus) (n = 76) and false killer
   whale (Pseudorca crassidens) (n = 71) in Aruban waters using photo
   identification techniques. Eleven injury categories were defined and
   linked to either human-related activities or natural causes. All injury
   categories were observed. In total, 18.7% of all individuals had at
   least one injury. Almost half (41.7%) of the injuries could be
   attributed to human interactions, of which fishing gear was the most
   common cause (53.3%) followed by propeller hits (13.3%). Major
   disfigurements were observed in all three species and could be
   attributed to interactions with fishing gear. The results of this study
   indicate that fishing gear and propeller hits may pose threats to small
   and medium-sized cetaceans in Aruban waters. Thus, long-term monitoring
   of population trends is warranted. Shark-inflicted bite wounds were
   observed in Atlantic spotted dolphin and bottlenose dolphin. Bite wounds
   of cookie cutter sharks (Isistius sp.) were recorded in all three
   species, and include the first documented record of a cookie cutter
   shark bite in Atlantic spotted dolphin. This is one of the few studies
   which investigates the prevalence of injuries in cetaceans in the
   Caribbean. Further study is necessary to determine to which extent the
   injuries observed in Aruba affect the health and survival of local
   populations.

   herbivorous fish assemblage on 10 coral reef sites in the Caribbean
   island of Guadeloupe (French West Indies). The herbivorous fish
   assemblage was assessed by visual census along band transects;
   environmental data were collected to determine the relationship between
   environmental conditions and temporal and spatial variations in
   herbivorous fish abundance and distribution. Spatial variation in
   species abundance was related to variation of the benthic cover (e.g.,
   coral and algae), depth, and protection status among sites. Short-term
   fluctuations of herbivorous fishes on the reef flats were linked to
   tide, swell, and wind, whereas long-term variations were seasonal and
   highly correlated to annual water temperature oscillations.

AB Fermentation is a critical step in the processing of high quality cocoa;
   however, the biochemistry behind is still not well understood at a
   molecular level. In this research, using a non-targeted approach, the
   main metabolomic changes that occur throughout the fermentation process
   were explored. Genetically undefined cocoa varieties from Trinidad and
   Tobago (n = 3), Costa Rica (n =1) and one clone IMC-67 (n = 3) were
   subjected to spontaneous fermentation using farm-based and pilot plant
   controlled conditions. Samples were collected daily, and
   acetone/water/acetic acid (70/29.5/0.5%) extracts were obtained and
   measured using a UPLC-ESI+-Q-Tof-MS system. Analysis of pre-processed
   data, applying a PLS-DA model, highlighted significant differences
   between the three fermentation periods, observed at 0-2, 3-4 and 5-6
   days, respectively. Among the most discriminating metabolites, sucrose,
   flavanols such as (epi) catechin, procyanidin dimers and trimers,
   anthocyanins and oligopeptides ranging in size from 3 to 12 amino acids
   were tentatively identified. In general, flavanols and sugars tended to
   decrease throughout fermentation, whereas most oligopeptides increased
   to maximal levels after 3 to 4 days of fermentation and decreased
   thereafter. These results shed new insight into cocoa fermentation
   optimization strategies and may also contribute to the development of
   novel alternatives for cocoa processing based on biochemical and
   functional values. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The relationships between body size and host specificity were studied in
   leaf-chewing and sap-sucking insect communities, including 792 species,
   feeding locally on 15 species of Ficus in a lowland rain forest in Papua
   New Guinea. A negative correlation between body size and host
   specificity, i.e., the tendency for large species to feed on numerous
   Ficus hosts and those smaller to have a more restricted host range, was
   found within both the sap-sucking and the leaf-chewing community. A more
   detailed analysis, which divided herbivorous species into three
   sap-sucking and four leaf-chewing guilds, revealed that the correlation
   between body size and host specificity was caused by differences in
   these traits between the guilds, while no such correlation was detected
   within any of the guilds. As the changes in feeding mode, defining
   various guilds, were unique evolutionary events, it is uncertain whether
   there is a functional relationship between feeding mode, body size and
   host specificity, or whether their correlation is only coincidental. It
   is suggested that, in the sap-sucking community at least, the positive
   body size versus host specificity correlation is a coincidental
   by-product of the causal relationship between the feeding mode and both
   the body size and host specificity. The causes of analogous patterns in
   a leaf-chewing community require further investigation. Methodological
   problems in the analysis of tropical insect communities, dominated by
   rare species, are discussed.

AB Flood risk assessment in many locations, especially in low-income
   countries, is severely hindered by a lack of hydrologic data. This study
   illustrates the application of regional rainfall frequency analysis,
   combined with ungauged basin analysis, to estimate flood discharges in
   the Gonaives basin in Haiti. Using limited daily rainfall data from
   seven gauges within and near the watershed, a regional extreme value
   distribution is selected and design storms are developed. These design
   storms are then input to a rainfall-runoff model, the parameters of
   which are estimated from spatial analysis of physical watershed
   characteristics. As a case study, the flood discharge and associated
   return period are estimated for the 2004 event that claimed 1,650 lives,
   and model outputs for other synthetic design storms are compared with
   large observed floods in other Caribbean basins similar in size to the
   Gonaives basin. Results of the comparative analysis indicate that the
   simulated peak flood flows of the Gonaives watershed are within the
   range of the maximum floods observed in other Caribbean basins with
   similar drainage areas, topography, and vegetation cover.

AB PREMISE OF THE STUDY: The Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) was a period of
   massive range contraction. Post-LGM, water -dispersed coastal species,
   including the red mangrove (Rhizophora mangle), expanded poleward as
   propagules were transported by ocean currents. We assessed postglacial
   marine expansion pathways for R. mangle within the Caribbean Basin and
   Florida.
   METHODS: Six microsatellite loci were used to genotype 237 individuals
   from nine R. mangle populations in the Caribbean, Florida, and Northwest
   Africa. We evaluated genetic variation, population structure, gene flow
   along alternative post-LGM expansion pathways to Florida, and potential
   long-distance dispersal (LDD) from West Africa to Caribbean islands.
   KEY RESULTS: These R. mangle populations had substantial genetic
   structure (FsT = 0.37, P < 0.0001) with three discrete population
   clusters (Caribbean mainland, Caribbean islands, and Florida). Genetic
   connectivity along the mainland pathway (Caribbean mainland to Florida)
   vs. limited gene dispersal along the Antilles Island pathway (Caribbean
   islands to Florida) supported Florida recolonization from Caribbean
   mainland sources. Genetic similarity of Northwest Africa and two
   Caribbean islands provided evidence for trans -Atlantic LDD. We did not
   find a pattern of decreasing genetic diversity with latitude.
   CONCLUSIONS: We outline a complex expansion history for R. mangle, with
   discrete pathways of recolonization for Florida and Caribbean islands.
   Contrary to expectation, connectivity to putative Caribbean mainland
   refugial populations via ocean currents, and not latitude, appears to
   dictate genetic diversity within Caribbean island and Florida R. mangle.
   These findings provide a framework for further investigation of
   additional water -dispersed neotropical species, and insights for
   management initiatives.

   Malaysia, Indonesia) and Oceania (Papua New Guinea and Solomon Islands)
   to elucidate their geographical distribution in tropical environment.
   The concentrations of organochlorines in these abiotic samples collected
   from Taiwan, Japan and Australia were also monitored for comparison.
   Atmospheric and hydrospheric concentrations of HCHs
   (hexachlorocyclohexanes) and DDTs (DDT and its metabolites) in the
   tropical developing countries were apparently higher than those observed
   in the developed nations, suggesting extensive usage of these chemicals
   in the lower latitudes. CHLs (chlordane compounds) and PCBs
   (polychlorinated biphenyls) were also occasionally observed at higher
   levels in the tropics, implying that their usage area is also expanding
   southward. Distribution patterns of organochlorines in sediments showed
   smaller spatial variations on global terms, indicating that the
   chemicals released in the tropical environment are dispersed rapidly
   through air and water and retained less in sediments. The ratios of
   organochlorine concentrations in sediment and water phases were
   positively correlated with the latitude of sampling, suggesting that
   persistent and semivolatile compounds discharged in the tropics tend to
   be redistributed on a global scale.

AB The United States Virgin Islands are comprised of two separate insular
   platforms separated by the deep water Anegada Passage. Although managed
   by the same regulations, as one fishery, several physical and spatial
   differences exist between the two northern shelf islands, St. Thomas and
   St. John, and isolated St. Croix. Based on two long-term fisheries
   independent datasets, collected by the U.S. Virgin Islands Territorial
   Coral Reef Monitoring Program and the National Oceanographic and
   Atmospheric Administration Center for Coastal Monitoring and Assessment,
   there were significant differences between the northern USVI and St.
   Croix in both the occurrence and size of several species of large and
   commercially important reef fishes. These fishes are primarily apex
   piscivores and generally the first species over-exploited in small-scale
   fisheries. The disparities between the fish communities on the two
   island shelves cannot be explained solely by differences in habitat
   (coral cover, rugosity) or fisheries management, such as relative amount
   of marine protected area in local waters. They are instead probably
   caused by a combination of several other interrelated factors including
   water depth, fishing methodology, fishable area, and the presence or
   absence of viable fish spawning areas. This study considers those
   aspects, and illustrates the need for management of island artisanal
   fisheries that is tailored to the physical and spatial constraints
   imposed by insular platforms.

AB We analyze far-field Rayleigh and tsunami waves generated by the 1998
   Papua New Guinea (PNG) earthquake. Using the normal mode theory and
   Thomson-Haskell matrix formalism we calculate synthetic mareograms of
   oceanic surface waves excited by finite-dimensional line source and
   propagated in a flat, multilayered oceanic structure. Assuming that the
   source of destructive sea waves was the main shock of the PNG event and
   based on the expression for seismic wave displacement in the far-field
   zone, we compute the energy of the seismic and tsunami waves and the
   E-z/E-ts ratio. The results of our modeling are generally consistent
   with those obtained empirically for events with magnitude 7. Also,
   treating the results of a submarine slide as a single solitary wave and
   using the theoretical arguments of Striem and Miloh (1976) we estimate
   the energy of the tsunami induced by a landslide. The difference between
   the energy of the seismic tsunami and of the aseismic one is about one
   order of magnitude.
   The results of our theoretical modeling show that surface sea waves in
   the far-field zone account well for seismic origin, although additional
   tsunami energy from a landslide source could be required to explain the
   local massive tsunami in the Sissano Lagoon.

AB Columbina passetina and C. minuta (Aves, Columbidae) are two Neotropical
   species of Ground Doves with similar morphology, behavior and natural
   history. However, they exhibit notably different distributions on
   Caribbean islands. While C. passerina is found on a majority of them, C.
   minuta is restricted in the Caribbean to Trinidad. We hypothesized that
   an explanation for this extreme difference in ranges is due to
   differences in at least three traits often associated with successful
   island colonization: morphological structures that promote long flight
   efficiency, dietary plasticity and water requirements. We tested the
   first factor by comparing several wing measurements and the other two
   factors with experiments on wild-caught birds in controlled conditions.
   We did not find significant differences in wing measures. However, C.
   passerina showed greater dietary plasticity, a wider diet breadth and
   lower daily water requirements than C. minuta. Keeping in mind that
   island colonization success may be shaped by many variables, we
   concluded that the success of C. passerina maintaining populations on so
   many Caribbean islands is at least partially explained by its ability to
   survive in environments with unpredictable food changes and severe fresh
   water limitations as usually found on some Caribbean islands.

AB The North Brazil Shelf is a Large Marine Ecosystem (LME) that extends
   from the Caribbean Sea, in Central America, to the Parnaiba River in
   Brazil, and includes six countries. The area is dominated by the runoff
   of large rivers, including the Amazon and Orinoco, and by the intense
   disturbance of sediment transport, tides and currents. The sea bed is
   formed mainly by mud in shallow water, and by sand, mud, and gravel in
   deeper water. In terms of its biological productivity, this LME can be
   considered oligotrophic, with stratified habitats. The main source of
   nutrients of the euphotic layer is the local rivers and mangroves.
   Primary production has been limited by light and rising temperatures in
   recent years, factors associated with a decrease in marine primary
   productivity. However, the benthic fauna is very rich and unique, but
   poorly known. More than 500 fish species have been recorded in this LME.
   Demersal fish and shrimp are the main fishery resources in coastal and
   continental shelf waters. Fisheries account for more than 600 million
   USD a year with a considerable diversity of methods and scales ranging
   from very small to industrial. Seafood consumption is moderate to high
   in the local countries. Climate changes, dam building, deforestation,
   pollution, overfishing, tourism and aquaculture are the main threats to
   ecosystem productivity and habitat quality. Socioeconomic data are scant
   for this LME. Development is concentrated near the cities and mouths of
   rivers. Traditional communities in the coastal areas are culturally
   diverse, but invariably characterized by very low socioeconomic
   conditions. The Gross Domestic Product of the local countries ranges
   from 7,500 USD per capita in Guyana to 32,600 USD per capita in Trinidad
   and Tobago. Profound problems of governability are common to all six
   countries, and mean governance indicators reflect poor performances in
   all cases. The main issues are an absence of effective rule of law,
   political stability, and control of corruption. Fisheries are
   characterized by increasing effort and an absence of sustainability.
   Most of the fishery stocks are either fully or over exploited. This
   scenario can only be rectified by investments in marine protected areas
   and scientific research, as well as the increased participation of
   fishers in the development and implementation of management strategies
   and regulations.

AB Planktonic foraminifera >0.125 mm are examined in six samples from the
   calcareous clays of the Brasso Formation at St. Fabien Quarry, Trinidad,
   for which they indicate an early Middle Miocene age (Globorotalia fohsi
   fohsi Zone, latest N10). The percentage of the foraminiferal fauna
   comprising planktonics (%P) is suggestive of outer neritic to upper
   bathyal paleo-depths, with a trend towards deeper water in the upper
   part of the section. Planktonic foraminiferal diversity, measured using
   the Information Function (H') is significantly correlated with %P.
   However, there is no correlation between %P and species dominance,
   measured using the Equitability Index (E). This implies that, while
   planktonic foraminiferal diversity of the >0.125 mm fraction increased
   with paleo-depth or distance from shore, dominance was not affected.
   Globigerina praebulloides, rare elsewhere in the tropics after the
   earliest Early Miocene, is abundant in the lower Middle Miocene at St.
   Fabien Quarry. This may indicate a tropical refuge provided by local
   upwelling of cool, nutrient-rich water during mid Miocene times.

AB In this paper, we present the results of a climatic analysis based on
   30-year (1971-2000) averages of precipitation and air temperature
   monthly data from 115 air temperature and precipitation stations of the
   National Meteorological Office and National Hydraulic Resources
   Institute of the Dominican Republic. The performed analysis provides a
   synthesis of the climate of the Dominican Republic, consistent with its
   orography and the atmospheric dynamics typical for the Caribbean region.
   According to the analysis, 54% of the Dominican territory can be
   classified as dry or semi-dry, and hence quite vulnerable to extensive
   or intensive land use practices, especially if inappropriate, with
   important implications in terms of water supplies, both for human
   consumption and for crop irrigation. This highlights the need to adopt
   appropriate policies to reduce vulnerability to climate change which,
   according to predictions, will lead to an increase in aridity.

AB Low molecular weight flavan-3-ols are thought to be responsible, in
   part, for the cardiovascular benefits associated with cocoa powder and
   dark chocolate. The levels of epicatechin and catechin were determined
   in raw and conventionally fermented cacao beans and during conventional
   processing, which included drying, roasting, and Dutch (alkali)
   processing. Unripe cacao beans had 29% higher levels of epicatechin and
   the same level of catechin compared to fully ripe beans. Drying had
   minimal effect on the epicatechin and catechin levels. Substantial
   decreases (>80%) in catechin and epicatechin levels were observed in
   fermented versus unfermented beans. When both Ivory Coast and Papua New
   Guinea beans were subjected to roasting under controlled conditions,
   there was a distinct loss of epicatechin when bean temperatures exceeded
   70 C. When cacao beans were roasted to 120 degrees C, the catechin level
   in beans increased by 696% in unfermented beans, by 650% in Ivory Coast
   beans, and by 640% in Papua New Guinea fermented beans compared to the
   same unroasted beans. These results suggest that roasting in excess of
   70 degrees C generates significant amounts of (-)-catechin, probably due
   to epimerization of (-)-epicatechin. Compared to natural cocoa powders,
   Dutch processing caused a loss in both epicatechin (up to 98%) and
   catechin (up to 80%). The epicatechin/catechin ratio is proposed as a
   useful and sensitive indicator for the processing history of cacao
   beans.

AB The bioaccumulation of mercury in the food webs incorporating the major
   piscivorous fish species of Lake Murray, Papua New Guinea, has been
   characterised. Methylmercury concentrations increased with trophic level
   and the proportion of total mercury present as methylmercury increased
   from <1% in plants to 94% in piscivorous fish. Methylmercury
   bioaccumulation factors (BAFs) were similar to those found in temperate
   environments, with a typical increase of 1 log unit between planktivore
   and piscivore trophic levels. The greatest bioaccumulation of
   methylmercury occurred between seston and the water column (log BAF of
   5.36). The bioaccumulation of mercury to levels of regulatory concern by
   the lake's piscivores was attributable to the biomagnification power of
   the plankton-based food chain comprising four trophic levels
   (phytoplankton, zooplankton, planktivore, piscivore) rather than any
   elevated concentrations of mercury in waters or sediments. The
   methylmercury concentrations of individual piscivores were positively
   correlated with both trophic position, as indicated by delta N-15
   measurements, and fish size. Stable-isotope measurements were used to
   identify fish species where dietary changes occurring with age
   significantly augmented age-related bioaccumulation of mercury.

   indexes (as the main and sub-main indexes) was selected to assess
   agricultural water management based on their importance and other
   indexes were not studied due to lack of adequate data. Changes in the
   main indexes in 2011 showed that concurrent values across regions varied
   according to the nature of the indexes and conditions of the countries.
   In the next step, the value of area equipped for irrigation/cultivated
   area (10th index) was estimated using the other main indexes. As a
   result, a list of strengths and weakness for agricultural water
   management in the Americas in the last 50 years was created. However,
   The only way to meet sustainable development is to learn from past
   experiences for the improvement of agricultural water management. The
   desirability of condition for agricultural water management is difficult
   for Central America (except Belize, which presents a fair status) and it
   is less than 40% for Greater Antilles (with the exception of Dominican
   Republic 55%). Guyana is the best country for agricultural water
   management because its desirability of condition (72%) is more than all
   the countries in Americas.

AB The Atlantic warm pool (AWP) is a large body of warm water comprising
   the Gulf of Mexico, Caribbean Sea, and western tropical North Atlantic.
   The AWP can vary on seasonal, interannual, and multidecadal time scales.
   The maximum AWP size is in the boreal late summer and early fall, with
   the largest extent in the year being about 3 times the smallest one. The
   AWP alternates with the Amazon basin in South America as the seasonal
   heating source for circulations of the Hadley and Walker type in the
   Western Hemisphere. During the boreal summer/fall, a strong Hadley-type
   circulation is established, with ascending motion over the AWP and
   subsidence over the southeastern tropical Pacific. This is accompanied
   by equatorward flow in the lower troposphere over the southeastern
   tropical Pacific, as dynamically required by the Sverdrup vorticity
   balance.
   It is shown by analyses of observational data and NCAR community
   atmospheric model simulations that an anomalously large (small) AWP
   during the boreal summer/fall results in a strengthening (weakening) of
   the Hadley-type circulation with enhanced descent (ascent) over the
   southeastern tropical Pacific. It is further demonstrated-by using a
   simple two-level model linearized about a specified background mean
   state-that the interhemispheric connection between the AWP and the
   southeastern tropical Pacific depends on the configuration of the
   background mean zonal winds in the Southern Hemisphere.

AB The fecundity and egg production of four species of small clupeoid, the
   anchovies Encrasicholina devisi, E. heterolobus, and the sprats
   Spratelloides delicatulus and S. lewisi, were examined at three sites in
   the Solomon Islands, tropical South Pacific. All species are multiple
   spawners and batch fecundity ranged between 500 and 1900 eggs per
   spawning, being significantly lower in the two sprat species than in the
   co-occurring anchovies. The fecundity of all species varied between
   sites, but not markedly between seasons. In Encrasicholina, fecundity
   was positively correlated with water temperature and zooplankton
   density, whereas in Spratelloides it was correlated with the
   hepatosomatic index. These results suggest that the fecundity of
   Encrasicholina is directly related to food intake, but Spratelloides
   probably depend on energy reserves in the liver for spawning.
   Egg volume differed between species and between sites for each species.
   Egg volume was inversely related to fecundity. Both species of
   Spratelloides had fewer, larger eggs than the similar-sized
   Encrasicholina species, which had much higher batch fecundity. This may
   be a consequence of lower or more predictable egg mortality that results
   from their benthic-spawning habits. Egg dry weight varied between sites
   for all species except E. devisi, but the pattern differed for each
   species. For Spratelloides, egg weight varied in a similar manner to egg
   volume. However, at any site the egg weights of all species were similar
   and showed little seasonal variation.
   These species are fast growing and short-lived (4-8 months); they spawn
   at 2 to 4 months of age and spawn, on average, every 2 to 8 days during
   their reproductive lifespan of up to 4 months. Differences within
   species in these reproductive parameters made monthly reproductive
   output highly variable, but with a similar mean life-time egg production
   at each site.
   The estimated daily population egg production of populations of each
   species varied with stock size (estimated from catch per unit effort).
   Daily egg production was correlated in E. devisi and E. heterolobus at
   Munda and Vona Vona, which suggests that similar factors affected egg
   production at these sites. However, there was no direct relationship
   between egg production and subsequent recruitment, except for S. lewisi
   at Tulagi. These results indicate that even for short-lived,
   fast-growing tropical species that recruit within 2 months of hatching,
   recruitment is more strongly influenced by factors such as variation in
   egg and larval survival than parental stock size.

   temperature regulation in incubation mounds (the 'Seymour Model'), I
   collected data on the physical characteristics of these mounds of the
   sympatric wattled brush-turkey (Aepypodius arfakianus), brown-collared
   talegalla (Talegalla jobiensis) and New Guinea megapode (Megapodius
   decollatus) in Papua New Guinea. Data from mounds supported several
   predictions of the Seymour Model: (1) there is a critical mass needed
   for mounds to heat to incubation temperatures, (2) mounds are stable
   homeotherms, (3) mounds cool after they are abandoned, and (4) mounds
   with different proportions of organic material differ in size. Data did
   not support predictions that (1) mound size will change with changes in
   ambient air temperature, and (2) mounds in high-rainfall areas will be
   convex to shed water. Mounds of New Guinea megapodes and brown-collared
   talegallas were similar and differed from those of wattled brush-turkeys
   in size, composition, temperature profile and location of eggs. These
   differences were consistent with the Seymour Model. The Seymour Model is
   robust enough to explain differences in mounds of sympatric megapodes,
   which differ in their taxonomy, behaviour and ecology.

AB Jamaica is the third largest island in the Caribbean. It has a history
   of being significantly impacted by flooding associated with tropical
   storms and hurricanes. In this study, model-generated rainfall data are
   used to investigate implications for peak discharge in the Hope River
   watershed in eastern Jamaica, for different scenarios of a hurricane
   passing over the island. While predictions of storm and hurricane
   hazards are available on a climate scale, sub-daily rainfall and wind
   data for scenarios of their passage (i.e. variations in path, speed
   and/or intensity) over a given Caribbean island do not exist. The
   rainfall data are obtained at 25 km spatial resolution using a new tool
   known as the Simple Model for Advection of Storms and Hurricane (SMASH).
   SMASH provides rainfall and wind speed data over Caribbean islands under
   varying tracks, speeds and/or categories for a select group of
   historical hurricanes. Hurricane Ivan is explored using three
   user-defined tracks and two user-defined forward speeds. The rainfall
   data are then conditioned over a hydrological model for the watershed to
   derive peak discharges at significant sections affected by flooding from
   such extreme events. The results show that SMASH reasonably represents
   the two peaks in rainfall but underestimates their magnitudes for a
   scenario configuration that approximates the historical passage of
   Hurricane Ivan over Jamaica. SMASH also approximates well the first 6 h
   of cumulative total rainfall intensity, but thereafter underestimates
   cumulative totals. Flow scenarios from HEC-HMS indicate higher intensity
   of discharge for a track south of the island (as opposed to a direct
   hit) and a shorter lag time to peak discharge with increase in speed of
   the hurricane. The results also suggest that, even for a direct hit, the
   orientation of storm path is seemingly significant when assessing
   vulnerability. The potential to use both SMASH and a hydrological model
   to create awareness to flooding from different types of tracks and
   speeds of hurricanes is demonstrated in this study. The benefit for
   planning to avoid loss of life and property is also discussed.

AB Small Island Developing States (SIDS) are quite diverse in terms of
   various development metrics, but are uniformly vulnerable both to
   macroeconomic shocks and to changes in the biodiversity that supports
   fisheries and tourism. This special section assembles a set of papers
   that analyze international demand for the natural resources associated
   with the two sectors, and the factors that lie behind changes in their
   supply. Since each stresses the resource base, albeit in different ways,
   we argue that limits on tourist pressure will be as important as limits
   on allowable fish catches in the future. We identify the challenge for
   SIDS as the need to implement an integrated, sustainable resource
   management strategy that allows biological resources to be allocated to
   their highest valued uses, while respecting the interests of those with
   prior rights to those resources.

AB Coral reefs have been affected by natural and anthropogenic
   disturbances. Coral cover has declined on many reefs, and macroalgae
   have increased on some. The existence of alternative stable states with
   high or low coral cover has been widely debated, but not clearly
   established. We evaluate the evidence for alternative stable states in
   benthic coral-reef dynamics in the Caribbean, Kenya and Great Barrier
   Reef (GBR), using stochastic semi-parametric models based on large
   numbers of time series of cover of hard corals, macroalgae and other
   components. Only the GBR showed a consistent short-term regional decline
   in coral cover. There was no evidence for regional increases in
   macroalgae. The equilibrium distributions of our models were close to
   recently observed distributions, and differed among regions. In all
   three regions, the equilibrium distributions were unimodal rather than
   bimodal, and thus did not suggest the existence of alternative stable
   states on a regional scale, under current conditions.

AB Nesting by three species of marine turtles persists in the Dominican
   Republic, despite historic threats and long-term population decline. We
   conducted a genetic survey of marine turtles in the Dominican Republic
   in order to link them with other rookeries around the Caribbean. We
   sequenced a 740(bp) fragment of the control region of the mitochondrial
   DNA of 92 samples from three marine turtle species [hawksbill (n = 48),
   green (n = 2) and leatherback (n = 42)], and incorporated published data
   from other nesting populations and foraging grounds. The leatherback
   turtle (Dermochelys coriacea) in the Dominican Republic appeared to be
   isolated from Awala-Yalimapo, Cayenne, Trinidad and St. Croix but
   connected with other Caribbean populations. Two distinct nesting
   populations of hawksbill turtles (Eremochelys imbricata) were detected
   in the Dominican Republic and exhibited interesting patterns of
   connectivity with other nesting sites and juvenile and adult male
   foraging aggregations. The green sea turtle (Chelonia mydas) has almost
   been extirpated from the Dominican Republic and limited inference could
   be made from our samples. Finally, results were compared with Lagrangian
   drifting buoys and published Lagrangian virtual particles that travelled
   through the Dominican Republic and Caribbean waters. Conservation
   implications of sink-source effects or genetic isolation derived from
   these complex inter-connections are discussed for each species and
   population.

AB The marine ornamental fish trade began in the 1930s in Sri Lanka, spread
   to Hawaii and the Philippines in the 1950s, and expanded to a
   multi-million dollar industry in the 1970s with fisheries established
   throughout the tropical Pacific, Indian and Atlantic Oceans. Currently,
   45 countries supply global markets an estimated 14-30 million fish
   annually, with an import value of US$28-44 million. The largest
   suppliers are Indonesia and the Philippines, followed by Brazil,
   Maldives, Vietnam, Sri Lanka and Hawaii. In the tropical Western
   Atlantic, 16 countries have export fisheries, including the U.S.
   (Florida and Puerto Rico). The U.S. is the world's largest buyer,
   followed by the European Union and Japan. The global trade consists of
   over 1400 species of reef fishes, of which only about 25 are captive
   bred on a commercial scale. Damselfish, anemonefish, and angelfish
   constitute over 50% of the global volume; butterflyfish, wrasses,
   blennies, gobies, triggerfish, file-fish, hawkfishes, groupers and
   basselets account for 31% of the trade, and the remaining 16% is
   represented by 33 families. The most important fishes from the Caribbean
   are angelfish (six species), seahorses (two species), royal gramma,
   jawfish, queen triggerfish, redlip blenny, puddingwife, bluehead wrasse,
   and blue chromis. The Caribbean currently supplies a small percentage of
   the global trade in marine ornamental species, but ornamental fisheries
   in this region represent important emerging industries. It is critical
   that effective ornamental fishery management plans and regulations are
   developed and enforced, and fishery-dependent and fishery-independent
   data are collected and utilized in decision making processes to ensure
   sustainable ornamental fisheries throughout the region.

AB In the last decade, real-time flood forecasting has become a more
   feasible approach to reducing the impacts of flooding in urban areas.
   Two key tools in this context are high resolution hydrodynamic modelling
   in combination with accurate hydrological forcing. In some cases, when
   it is not possible to produce such accurate flood forecasts based on
   high resolution models and data, it may nevertheless be possible to use
   the resources currently available, accepting that there is a greater
   degree of uncertainty involved. This paper demonstrates the feasibility
   of a remotely controlled, real-time, pluvial flood forecasting system
   for Castries, St. Lucia that utilises the limited data available
   locally. The results from the study suggest that although Global
   Forecast System (GFS) rainfall data may be considered coarse for urban
   applications, there is still a significant amount of skill and usability
   after it is postprocessed and used in combination with observed rainfall
   data. Evidence from the study also suggests that the use of images from
   different sources is invaluable for 2D overland model calibration and
   validation in urban areas. Conclusions from the study are potentially
   transferable to other sites in similar data-scare and resource-limited
   locations.

AB The influence of urbanisation on physical activity and dietary changes
   was examined in a Papua New Guinea Highland population. Adult male and
   female subjects (n 56) were selected, including twenty-seven rural
   villagers and twenty-nine urban migrants. BMR was calculated from values
   measured in similar samples of Huli-speaking population, according to
   gender and body weight. Total daily energy expenditure (TEE) was
   assessed by 24 h heart rate (HR) monitoring (flex-HR method) and
   physical activity level (PAL) calculation was based on BMR. Energy,
   protein and fat intakes were measured by weighing food on a single day.
   Urban subjects were heavier and taller than their rural counterparts;
   significant differences were found in stature in men (P < 0.05) and body
   weight in women (P < 0.05). Urban subjects had longer sedentary periods
   (HR I flex-MR) and shorter active periods (HR > flex-MR) than rural
   subjects. Consequently, the former had lower TEE and PAL than the
   latter; significant differences were found in women (TEE, P < 0.05, PAL,
   P < 0.01) but not in men. Total daily energy intake and TEE were well
   balanced (<7 %) in all groups, whereas protein and fat intakes were
   considerably higher in urban subjects than rural subjects. Reduced PAL
   and increased fat intake by urban dwellers may increase the risks of
   obesity and chronic degenerative diseases.

   and more loss than those found within vegetation or on the beach.
   Fragmentation was not significantly different across localities (p =
   0.045). This result suggests that the fossil record of land crabs may be
   biased as a result of their low preservation potential in terrestrial
   environments. The discovery of eight poorly preserved Holocene chelae on
   San Salvador Island contrasts starkly with the abundance and
   preservational quality of surficial remains. Rapid burial is likely
   required for their preservation but may not ensure the preservation of
   the cuticle.

AB Objective: This study intends to explore young people's knowledge,
   attitudes and practices regarding dengue fever in Trinidad and Tobago.
   Methods: Interviews and focus groups were carried out with young people
   studying at the University of Trinidad and Tobago. Thematic analysis was
   then conducted on these scripts and recommendations for improvement were
   made.
   Results: All participants had some knowledge about dengue fever;
   however; the extent of this knowledge varied greatly. Participants knew
   most about the mode of spread and symptoms. All participants did
   something at home as a means of vector control of the disease; ensuring
   no stagnant water was present in containers in the yard was the most
   popular method of vector control. All participants were aware that the
   government sprayed the neighbourhoods against mosquitoes; however, the
   majority thought they did not do this often enough.
   Conclusion: Following the results of this study, three recommendations
   were made: the government should spray on a more regular basis,
   particularly just before the rainy season; a pilot study should take
   place investigating whether a fining scheme would improve vector control
   and dengue fever health education should be improved.

AB Freshwater, aquaculture, fisheries, biodiversity, forests, and
   agricultural land have high economic and social value throughout the
   Africa, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) region; but they can also be
   over-exploited, with damaging consequences for local economies, long
   term stability and for the Earth system as a whole - especially the
   climate system. The ACP's fast growing population puts growing pressure
   on the environment to provide food, water and fibre, on the regions'
   urban centres and transport networks, and on energy sources. Information
   on the location, condition and evolution of resources is an important
   step towards sustainability, but unfortunately such information can be
   hard to get. Earth observing satellite technology combined with
   geographical information management can help fill the information gap.
   In this objective, and because of its unique position to support the
   implementation of advanced interoperable geospatial technologies, the
   Joint Research Centre (JRC) of the European Commission (EC) is
   setting-up of an "Observatory for sustainable development" as single
   portal to support decision-making for development in the fields of
   natural resource and food security. The African Union and European Union
   recognise the importance of this service and are beginning to develop
   this capacity as part of the AU EU joint strategic partnership. This
   paper describes the needs, and presents the first steps taken by the JRC
   and by the joint partnership in harnessing space technologies to help
   meet Millennium Development Goals, in particular eradication of poverty,
   and environmental sustainability.

   evaluated, at 2 tree densities (3333 and 6666 trees ha(-1)) for the
   Western Highlands Province (WHP) and National Capital District (NCD) of
   Papua New Guinea. Of the 10 species tested, the best production of
   firewood was from Eucalyptus grandis and Eucalyptus robusta in WHP and
   Eucalyptus tereticornis in the NCD, with values of 2.97 m(3), 2.55 m(3),
   and 0.92 m(3) for a 500 m(2) woodlot respectively at the denser spacing.
   E. grandis and E. robusta produced best tree form in WHP while
   Eucalyptus pellita produced best form in NCD. Best coppice performance
   was observed in E. robusta in WHP and E. tereticornis in NCD. The
   burning characteristics of SRC firewood and charcoal were also assessed,
   as well as how SRC firewood will appeal to consumers. In the highlands
   SRC firewood and charcoal yield higher estimated returns to labour
   (USD20.00 and USD11.16 person(-1)day(-1)) compared with main alternative
   crops of sweet potato and coffee (USD9.77 and USD6.98 person(-1)day(-1)
   respectively). SRC pole production has a low return to labour (USD7.44
   person(-1)day(-1)) but could complement SRC production as part of a
   thinning regime. The main limitation in promulgating SRC systems could
   be market acceptance and finding a small-business model that integrates
   well with the indigenous non-market economy. The poor growth rates
   around the NCD due to limiting biophysical conditions make a 2 year
   rotation cycle unfeasible. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Sediment contamination in the Caribbean has not been extensively
   studied. This review article outlines known cases of sediment
   contamination in the Caribbean and their impacts on Caribbean
   ecosystems. It also discusses regulation and remediation of contaminated
   sediments in the Caribbean and speculates on what the future holds
   regarding sediment toxicity. Existing information suggests that sediment
   contamination may be widespread, although not severe in most areas.
   Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands contain two National Priority
   List sites and one candidate site under U.S. Superfund jurisdiction.
   These territories will be more extensively studied under the U.S.
   Environmental Monitoring and Assessment Program. Regulation of sediment
   contamination is difficult within the Caribbean region because
   jurisdiction is shared by 27 independent countries and a number of
   territories and dependencies. In addition to establishing control of
   natural resources within a 200-mile offshore limit for each Caribbean
   nation, the recently created Exclusive Economic Zone contains provisions
   for environmental protection and management, but many governments in the
   region lack the resources to implement them. The Caribbean Action Plan
   formalizes international cooperation and assistance to overcome some of
   these limitations. Many Caribbean countries have experienced a strong
   industrial expansion and a rapid population growth during the last 30 to
   40 years, and there is potential for further contamination as these
   islands develop.

AB The Gulf of Uraba represents the southernmost portion of the Caribbean
   Sea. Due to the large amounts of sediment and freshwater discharged by
   the Atrato river and several minor streams, water conditions in the area
   are far from being optimal for coral settlement and growth. However,
   fringing and patch reefs are developed along the rocky shores of the
   northwest margin of the Gulf. Based on field observations performed at
   44 sites (12 of them assessed quantitatively), interpretation of air
   photography of the area and depth profiles, the distribution, structure
   and zonation of the reefs are described. Classification analysis of the
   12 sample sites yielded four coral assemblages: Diploria strigosa,
   crustose algae, Siderastrea siderea, Agaricia spp., and mixed massive
   corals. Other two assemblages, dominated respectively by Millepora
   complanata and thickets of Acropora palmata were noticed during
   reconnaissance dives. The distribution of these zones within the reef
   seems likely to be mainly controlled by wave exposure, bottom
   topography, sedimentation, and light penetration. Reef development,
   coral diversity and live coral cover increase along the coast in a SE-NW
   direction, with an evident maximum near to the cove of Sapzurro,
   suggesting an overall improvement of conditions for coral growth and
   settlement in that direction. A total of 33 species of hard corals were
   recorded during the survey. It is apparent that the live coral cover,
   particularly of foliose and branching species, has notably declined
   recently.

AB Theoretical and empirical evidence suggest that positive feedbacks can
   increase resilience in ecological communities. On Caribbean coral reefs,
   there have been striking shifts from physically complex communities with
   high coral cover to relatively homogenous communities dominated by
   macroalgae, which have persisted for decades. However, little is known
   about positive feedbacks that may maintain coral reef community states.
   Here, I explore a potential consumer-mediated feedback on a Jamaican
   reef by examining how grazing by a keystone herbivore (Diadema
   antillarum) is enhanced by physical structure, which offer refugia from
   predation. Surveys revealed that habitat complexity and Diadema density
   were positively related. Increasing habitat complexity by adding
   physical structure significantly decreased macroalgal cover and
   increased the proportion of urchins in algal habitats in field
   manipulations. Experimental increases in urchin density also decreased
   macroalgal cover, but did not affect the proportion of urchins in algal
   habitats. These results suggest that the low habitat complexity of
   macroalgal-dominated reefs may inhibit an urchin-mediated shift to coral
   dominance and that positive feedbacks must be considered in reef
   restoration efforts.

PY 2007
AB Papua New Guinea (PNG) is an independent state occupying the eastern
   half of New Guinea, the world's largest and highest tropical island. In
   recognition of its extensive remaining forest cover, spectacular
   biological diversity and low human population density, New Guinea has
   been recognised as one of the world's five High Biodiversity Wilderness
   Areas (Mittermeier et al. 2003). In addition to extensive low- and
   mid-elevation tropical forests, New Guinea has extensive high-montane
   environments, particularly along the central mountainous spine of the
   island. This central cordillera, formed by uplift resulting from the
   collision of the Australian Plate with the Pacific Plate, presents
   dramatic gradients of topography, elevation, temperature and rainfall
   that have promoted rapid evolution of an exceptionally diverse biota.
   Although the montane birds and flora of New Guinea have been moderately
   well documented (e.g. Royen 1982, Beehler et al. 1986), documentation of
   most biota at high elevations has been sporadic at best and major gaps
   in survey effort continue to hinder meaningful discussions about
   conservation priorities for, and biogeographic relationships among, the
   New Guinean biota. With an area of 12,800 km2 Enga Province in Papua New
   Guinea's central highlands region includes a higher proportion of upper
   montane (>3,000 m) environments than any other province in Papua New
   Guinea (Loeffler 1977). It is also the site of the Porgera Mine, a major
   openpit gold mining operation that accounts for 14% of the country's
   export earnings, making it the world's eighth largest gold producer in
   terms of 2005 output. Remarkably, despite the substantial infrastructure
   established by this mining operation, Enga Province appears to have the
   lowest biological survey effort of any province in the country. Prior to
   this RAP survey only a handful of collections had been made in the
   province. The proximity of Porgera Mine to the vast Kaijende Highlands
   provided the opportunity to redress this paucity of biological
   information through a RAP biodiversity survey designed and conducted by
   Conservation International and the PNG Department of Environment and
   Conservation, and sponsored by the Porgera Joint Venture mining
   operation. Scope of Project The RAP biodiversity survey reported here
   was undertaken as part of a long-term commitment by Conservation
   International (CI) to assist with the establishment of a Conservation
   Area covering the Kaijende Highlands of Enga Province. Discussions
   between CI, the PNG Department of Environment and Conservation (DEC) and
   the Porgera Joint Venture partners (PJV) resulted in a consensus that CI
   would play a lead role in developing the project. To this end CI has
   established an office at Porgera with funding support from PJV.
   Locally-based CI staff are working with local landowners and local NGOs
   to establish the area (see Map) as a Conservation Area under the
   Conservation Area Act with assistance from the DEC. The Mt. Kaijende
   Conservation Area will have a management plan and a development plan,
   rules, a management committee, and the steps towards establishment will
   allow for participation by the general public and by landowners.
   Follow-up awareness activities during 2007 have generated substantial
   support from local landowners, the PNG Mining Department and other
   stakeholders. The RAP results reported here are the result of a
   successful partnership between CI, DEC, PJV and a number of local
   communities. We hope that the information gathered during this survey
   will play a useful role in informing the development of sustainable
   management strategies for this spectacular region. RAP SURVEY OVERVIEW
   AND OBJECTIVES Conservation International's Rapid Assessment
   Program(RAP) is an innovative biological inventory program designed to
   use scientific information to catalyze conservation action. RAP methods
   are designed to rapidly assess the biodiversity of highly diverse areas
   and to train local scientists in biodiversity survey techniques. Since
   1990, RAP's teams of expert and host-country scientists have conducted
   60 terrestrial, freshwater aquatic (AquaRAP), and marine biodiversity
   surveys and have contributed to building local scientific capacity for
   scientists in 26 countries. Biological information from previous RAP
   surveys has resulted in the protection of millions of hectares of
   tropical forest, including the declaration of protected areas in
   Bolivia, Peru, Ecuador, and Brazil and the identification of
   biodiversity priorities in numerous countries. The primary objective of
   this RAP survey was to document the plant, herpetofauna, bird and mammal
   diversity of the Kaijende Highlands, a vast region of near-uninhabited
   montane forest and grasslands in Enga Province. The information we
   gathered will be used to make recommendations about the conservation
   significance of, and management options for, the remarkable biodiversity
   of this area. Survey sites were selected to include the major habitat
   types contained within the proposed Mt. Kaijende Conservation Area. The
   specific aims of this RAP survey were to: * Produce an overview of the
   diversity and conservation significance of selected plant and animal
   taxa at elevations between 2,000 and 3,300 m. * Evaluate threats to
   biodiversity of the region, and recommend management strategies for
   their mitigation that are relevant to local communities, government
   agencies, and the nearby Porgera Mine. * Provide on-site training in
   biodiversity inventory techniques for staff from DEC.* Make RAP data
   available for decision-makers at all levels of Government, and to local
   communities, NGOs and the general public, with a view to promoting the
   establishment of a Conservation Area in the Mt. Kaijende Highlands.
   Study Area The Kaijende Highlands incorporate an extensive area of
   montane habitats (>2,000 m elevation) adjacent to the Porgera Mine in
   Enga Province, Papua New Guinea (see Map). Population density in the
   proposed Conservation Area is extremely low, but trails linking small
   villages and others used by hunters criss-cross the area. A
   well-travelled trailthrough the high-montane grasslands of the Kaijende
   Highlands links Porgera Town with the Mt. Kare goldfields. As in most
   areas of Melanesia, land ownership in this region is complex and
   numerous clans lay claim to parts of the Kaijende Highlands. The area
   behind Mt. Kumbepara, from Omyaka to the Porgera Reservoir, is owned by
   the Pulumaini, Angalaini, Tieni and Aipakani clans. The Omyaka camp site
   was on Pulumaini land. The LakeTawa area belongs to people from Kole and
   Kanzawi villages (Paiela) who also own the Mt. Kare area. The Paiela
   Road area is owned by the Pulumaini, Angalaini, Tieni and Tuanda clans.
   Land around Suyan is owned by the Aipakani-Kealo/ Pepe (Suyan Camp), and
   the Timain and Paiam clans (areas behind Suyan). Site descriptions The
   climate of the Kaijende Highlands area, extrapolated from rainfall and
   temperature data collected at the PJV Environment Department offices on
   the Porgera Mine site at around 2,200 m, is relatively aseasonal. Mean
   monthly minimum air temperature recorded daily between 2001 and 2004
   varied between just 11.3 and 13.0[degree]C and mean monthly maximum
   temperature varied between 18.8 and21.0[degree]C (Figure 1).
   Precipitation is high, with a long-term (1974 - 2006) mean annual
   rainfall of 3,679.6 mm (range 2,505.8 - 4,413.0 mm) but rainfall shows a
   more pronounced seasonal effect than temperature (Figure 2). The mean
   monthly rainfall calculated for each month over 33years was 306.6 mm
   when calculated across all months, but there are distinctly wetter and
   drier 'seasons' with a maximum mean monthly rainfall of 370 mm in March
   and a minimum of 246.6 mm in July. Figure 2 shows long-term (1974 -
   2006) mean monthly rainfall and the 2005 total rainfall for Porgera Mine
   to illustrate the period leading up to and including this RAP survey.
   The RAP survey was conducted during a year when rainfall in September
   was much higher than the long-term mean. However maximum and minimum
   monthly rainfall totals at Porgera over the same period do not follow
   the trend shown by the monthly means illustrated in Figure 2; they show
   that most months can be extremely wet (> 450 mm) or extremely dry (<150
   mm) in any given year. Although the Porgera climate data probably
   broadly reflect conditions at the lower elevations throughout the
   KaijendeHighlands, including Lake Tawa, it should be noted that climate
   in the area varies dramatically with topography and altitude. The
   highest elevations of the Kaijende Highlands experience climatic
   conditions that are much more extreme than those reported for Porgera,
   and air temperatures recorded in the upper-montane grasslands around
   Omyaka and Waile Creek during this survey regularly dropped to
   5[degree]C. Unfortunately, comprehensive rainfall and temperature data
   for these high-montane sites are unavailable. The survey was conducted
   around four major 'sites' at elevations between 2,000 m and 3,400 m.
   These localities provided access to a range of habitats including
   montane grasslands, upper montane forests, mid-montane forest, and
   disturbed mid-montane forest regrowth and gardens. Geologically, this
   highland area is on the New Guinea Fold Belt (Hill and Hall 2003), and
   lies to the south of the complex system of geological terranes that have
   accreted to northern New Guinea (Pigram and Davies 1987). The survey
   schedule and location of major sites are presented in Table 1. The major
   vegetation formations of the study area are described in detail in
   Chapter 1 and a gazetteer for, and brief descriptions of vegetation at,
   each major site and each 'sub-site' are presented in Appendix 1. The
   general topography of Lake Tawa, and the location of significant
   collection sites and habitats around this valley are illustrated in
   Figure 3. SUMMARY Of RAP RESUlTS By TAXONOMIC GROUP vegetation The flora
   of the Kaijende Highlands occurs in three principal vegetation
   formations: 1) lower montane forest, 2) upper montane forest, and 3)
   subalpine grassland. A total of 492 tracheophytic plant species were
   documented during this survey including 112 ferns and lycophytes, 6
   gymnosperms, 69 monocots, and 305 dicots from a total of 262 genera. At
   least 16 plants are determined as species new to science,including five
   arborescent taxa, five understory shrubs, two vines, two orchids, and
   two ferns. Herpetofauna Seventeen frog and two reptile species were
   documented from montane forests and montane grassland habitats in the
   Kaijende Highlands. At least eight of the frog species are undescribed
   and one of these probably warrants recognition as a new genus. This
   survey documented the second known population of Callulops glandulosus,
   and a very large species of Albericus found at Lake Tawa may represent
   only the second known population of A. fafniri. Both of these species
   were considered Data Deficient by the Global Amphibian Assessment. One
   other frog, Litoria becki, found only in high-montane grassland
   habitats, was considered Vulnerable in the recent Global Amphibian
   Assessment. Although the reptile fauna was depauperate, this reflects
   the high-elevationfocus of our survey and the low diversity is probably
   typical of sites at similar elevations elsewhere in New Guinea. One of
   the two species documented, a skink of the genus Sphenomorphus, may
   represent an undescribed taxon. Birds Nineteen days of surveys,
   including a series of 'walkingcensuses' undertaken at key sites,
   detected 102 species of birds. The Long-bearded Melidectes (Melidectes
   princeps) was recorded for the first time west of the Mount Hagen
   massif. The Ribbon-tailed Astrapia (Astrapia mayeri), a spectacular
   long-tailed species with a severely circumscribed distribution centered
   on our study area, was common from 2,117 m at Lake Tawa to 3,200 m at
   Omyaka Camp. Although the Crested Bird of Paradise (Cnemophilus
   macgregorii) was not encountered on this survey, one local informant at
   Omyaka Camp stated that it was present and the species was apparently
   collected in a DEC field survey (Kula 1989). It appears that there is a
   substantial geographic break in this species' range between the
   Hagen/Giluwe area and the Star Mountains of Papua (Indonesia). This
   provides an intermediate-stage example of Diamond's "drop-out"
   phenomenon(Diamond 1972). The Kaijende Highlands support a rich upland
   bird fauna that might best be conserved through the creation of a large
   contiguous community-managed reserve that encompasses uninhabited
   traditional hunting lands. Mammals This survey confirmed the occurrence
   of one monotreme, 18 marsupials, nine rodents, two bats, and two
   non-native placental mammals (wild-living dogs and pigs) in the Kaijende
   Highlands. Previous surveys in this area had recorded just one marsupial
   species, three rodent species, and one bat species that were not
   detected in the current survey. Our survey brings the total number of
   native marsupials, rodents, and bats recorded in the Kaijende Highlands
   to 35 and in Enga Province to 39. Significant new records for the
   Kaijende Highlands include the third vouchered locality for Calaby's
   Pademelon (Thylogale calabyi) and the first record of the Giluwe Rat
   (Rattus giluwensis) outside of the immediate vicinity of Mt. Giluwe in
   Southern Highlands Province. CONSERvATiON RECOMMENDATIONS Protection of
   important habitats The Cyathea savanna that dominates the Kaijende upper
   montane zone at elevations between 3,000 m and at least 3,400 m is
   unique to the island of New Guinea. These upper montane habitats and
   vegetation formations are not protected by existing conservation
   initiatives in Papua New Guinea. Because island endemism is higher in
   Upper Montane Forest and subalpine environments than in the low
   elevation habitats typically covered by many conservation areas in Papua
   New Guinea, protection of the Kaijende Highlands will provide security
   for a number of endemic taxa presently excluded from conservation
   consideration. This survey has identified a suite of plants, frogs and
   mammals that appear to be dependent on these subalpine environments. The
   highaltitude tree fern savanna, tussock grassland, and adjacent upper
   montane (elfin) forests also support a poorly known assemblage of mammal
   species that have become rare or disappeared from many other montane
   sites in New Guinea. Another habitat that may require specific targeting
   for conservation action is limestone outcrops. Three new plantspecies
   were associated with karst formations during the 2005 RAP survey and
   additional surveys are required to determine whether these localized
   habitats harbor a substantial endemic plant or animal biota. The
   Kaijende Highlands not only harbor a large number of poorly known and
   significant species and habitats, but the landscapes of the region are
   scenic and visually stunning. The aesthetic beauty of the Kaijende
   Highlands provides afurther compelling argument for protection of these
   montane habitats. The Cyathea grassland panoramas at Omyaka and Waile
   Creek and the lakeside vistas at Lake Tawa are among the most
   spectacular ever encountered by the RAP team, and the dramatic limestone
   pinnacles emerging fromdense mid-montane forest near Porgera are
   breathtaking. Our results strongly vindicate the current efforts to
   establisha Wildlife Conservation Area in the Kaijende Highlands.
   Conservation International, the PNG Department of Environment and
   Conservation and PJV are working with local communities to develop a
   sustainable, long-term conservation plan for the proposed Conservation
   Area. We hope that the results of our survey will be used to promote
   interest in the Kaijende Highlands among local communities, and among
   decision makers in Local, Provincial and National Governments.
   Particular attention should be placed on educating local landowners
   about the significance of their unique biota on a global scale, about
   the importance of adopting sustainable hunting practices to ensure the
   longterm survival of many bird and larger mammal species that are
   becoming scarce in the mountains of New Guinea, and about the benefits
   of protecting their montane forests and about the benefits of protecting
   their montane forests and grasslands from increasingly frequent fires
   and other destructive human activities. With the interest and support of
   the local communities, the Kaijende Highlands could become a model
   protected area in Papua New Guinea. Species-specific recommendations
   Studies are needed to assess in greater detail the distribution,
   abundance, and threats faced by wallabies, tree-kangaroos, and echidnas
   in the Kaijende Highlands. These large mammals have disappeared from
   most areas with high human population density throughout New Guinea.
   Although Zaglossus and at least three different kangaroo species
   (Dendrolagus dorianus, Dorcopsulus vanheurni, and Thylogale calabyi)
   still persist in the vicinity of Porgera, the 2005 RAPteam did not
   encounter living animals of these species. They were documented solely
   based on information from informants or from trophy jaws. Clearly there
   is at least some hunting pressure on these animals. Obtaining
   information about abundance, hunting pressure, and microdistributionof
   large mammals in the region is a high priority if these species are to
   be conserved in the long term. These studies will require the assistance
   and knowledge of local communities, and might prove to be a
   straightforward and manageable project, perhaps one that can be
   undertaken by a sponsoredstudent or a PJV Environmental Officer. Future
   Research The cost and logistical challenges of working in New Guinea's
   remote high-montane environments are a major impediment to research. As
   a result, most upper montane habitats on the island remain very poorly
   documented. The success of our Kaijende survey was due in large part to
   the logistical support provided by the Porgera mine, and also to the
   infrastructure, including roads, that has been established in the
   surrounding district. Few areas in Papua New Guinea offer such
   advantages for an ongoing program of conservationassessments and
   biological studies. Long-term monitoring programs The upper montane
   habitats of the Kaijende Highlands provide an opportunity to monitor
   long-term floristic change caused by global warming. Upper Montane
   Forest is acutely responsive to temperature shifts induced by climatic
   change, as demonstrated by palynological evidence from Holocene
   sediments. Baseline studies should be established that not only document
   subsequent shifts in upper montane forest composition and distribution,
   but also examine concurrent changes in abundance and assemblage
   structure of animal taxa associated exclusively or primarily with these
   habitats. Fauna identified as high priorities for monitoring programs
   include a new genus and species of frog known only from grasslands at
   Omyaka, and a number of large mammal species that may already be under
   threat from over-hunting.Biodiversity surveys The results of the short
   Kaijende Highlands RAP survey were spectacular and it is clear that
   additional biodiversity surveys targeting habitats and elevations not
   covered during the 2005 RAP survey will document numerous additional
   species in the proposed Mt. Kaijende Conservation Area. Additional
   surveys will also be critical for assessing the distribution and
   conservation status of a number of threatened or significant species
   encountered or otherwise documented during the 2005 RAP survey (e.g.
   Thylogale calabyi, Zaglossus bartoni and Dendrolagus dorianus, three new
   species of microhylid frogs, several new plant species). Inasmuch as the
   flora and vertebrate fauna of the Upper Montane Forests are highly
   significant from a conservation perspective but relatively depauperate
   in terms of species richness, a series of targeted surveys could provide
   themost comprehensive biodiversity assessment of Upper Montane Forest
   and grasslands for any area in New Guinea to date. All participants in
   the Kaijende RAP survey noted that extending biodiversity survey
   activities to areas below 2,000 m elevation would dramatically increase
   the variety of biota documented. With support from PJV a trans-watershed
   biodiversity survey transect extending from the Kaijende Highlands to
   the lowlands along the Strickland River would be an ambitious project
   that would put the Kaijende Highlands fauna and flora in a broad
   biological and biogeographiccontext. In addition, with community support
   any future extension of the boundaries of the Conservation Area to
   accommodate contiguous habitats below 2,000 m elevation would
   substantially increase the biodiversity values of the Conservation Area.
   Ecotourism potential Tourism is a small but potentially lucrative
   business for Papua New Guinea. Few areas in the country can boast the
   combination of spectacular scenery and established infrastructure of the
   Kaijende Highlands region. Properly marketed, the Kaijende Highlands
   could attract visitors from elsewhere in PNG andfrom overseas. Formal
   designation of the Kaijende Highlands as a Conservation Area will
   increase the area's attractiveness as a travel destination. However it
   should be recognized that the tourism market is small. Studies to assess
   the potential of specialised eco-tours, or the promotion of
   research-based 'tourism' should be conducted as a matter of priority.

AB OCEANIAFOODS was established in 1987. Countries under its umbrella are
   Australia, New Zealand and the Secretariat of Pacific Communities (SPC,
   formerly the South Pacific Commission), which represents 22 Pacific
   Island governments. The convenorship rotates among these three regions.
   This report highlights major activities undertaken by OCEANIAFOODS from
   2002 to 2005. The SPC, based in New Caledonia, includes a Lifestyle
   Health section (LHS) and a sub-office in Fiji. In Fiji, the Food and
   Agriculture Organisation (FAO) commissioned a project to strengthen food
   analytical capability in the Pacific region. The project, which ran from
   April 2002 to August 2004, succeeded in meeting all its goals with some
   adjustments. In Australia, food composition work is undertaken by Food
   Standards Australia New Zealand (FSANZ) and has focused on three key
   areas: providing a free web-based nutrition panel calculator for
   nutrition labelling, preparing for the release of updated Australian
   nutrient data, and initiating several small analytical projects
   including the analysis of iodine levels in common foods and folates and
   folic acid in foods such as breakfast cereals. Activities outside FSANZ
   include further research on folate analysis at the University of New
   South Wales. In New Zealand, the focus has been on developing the food
   composition database. In 2003, Dr. Heather Greenfield reviewed the New
   Zealand Food Composition Database (NZFCDB), and in July 2004 the
   Ministry of Health renewed Crop and Food Research's contract until June
   2007 to maintain the database. Publications over the last 3 years
   include the sixth edition of the concise food composition tables and
   release of an updated FOODFiles2004 electronic data files. In April
   2005, the Seventh OCEANIAFOODS Conference, Innovations in Nutrient
   Information, was held in Wellington, New Zealand. Fifty-nine delegates
   attended the conference at which keynote addresses were given by Joanne
   Holden (USA), Bill Aalbersberg (Fiji), and Heather Greenfield
   (Australia). The conference resulted in 13 recommendations being
   formulated. The convenor of the next OCEANIAFOODS conference is

AB The effective rural electrification method varies with economic status
   and geographical location, and the benefits of decentralized generation
   differ for each energy system depending on its characteristics. This
   paper evaluates the most effective generation strategies with rural
   electrification in an optimized power system of Papua New Guinea (PNG)
   using a linear programming model. The energy system model developed for
   the study includes decentralized generation, centralized generation, and
   grid systems of electricity and gas with consideration for the current
   energy system and infrastructure. Two methods of rural electrification,
   decentralized generation and grid extension, are compared with and
   without the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM). The results of
   simulations show that extending the power grid that allows economical
   generation such as coal-fired power and hydropower to supply rural
   electricity is a more cost effective way for rural electrification.
   Although grid extension is more capital intensive than decentralized
   generation, the former reduces the total system cost through reduction
   of the fossil fuel use. Extending the power grid is also effective at
   attracting CDM investments, since it makes the power system flexible and
   provides opportunities to advance low emitting energy such as
   hydropower. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB New bathymetric and geophysical data were collected in the region east
   of the island of Malaita during the SOPACMAPS II cruise of the French
   research vessel L'ATALANTE. This region, part of the Malaita
   Anticlinorium was interpreted as a piece of oceanic crust from the
   Ontong Java Plateau obducted over the old Solomon Islands are during
   collision between the Pacific and Australian plates. It has been
   generally accepted that convergent motion between the Australia and
   Pacific plates since the Late Miocene was absorbed exclusively along the
   San Cristobal trench, southwest of the Solomon Islands Are.
   Bathymetry, imagery, and geophysical data (magnetism, gravity, seismic)
   acquired during the SOPACMAPS II survey allow us to classify the
   successive parallel ridges mapped within the region as being recent
   volcanic, oceanic crust, or deformed sedimentary ridges.
   Seismic profiling provides evidence of successive compressive events
   along the Malaita margin caused by the relative motion between the
   Solomon Islands and the Pacific plate. The main phase of convergence
   probably occurred during Oligocene-early Miocene time, but some relative
   motion between the two domains are still being absorbed along the East
   Malaita boundary. The existence of active faulting in the sedimentary
   cover throughout the region and the present-day deformation of the outer
   sedimentary ridge is a good illustration of this phenomenon.

AB The taxonomic status of many dolphin populations remains uncertain in
   poorly studied regions of the world's ocean. Here we attempt to clarify
   the phylogenetic identity of two distinct forms of bottlenose dolphins
   (Tursiops spp.) described in the Melanesian region of the Pacific Ocean.
   Mitochondrial DNA control region sequences from samples collected in New
   Caledonia (n=88) and the Solomon Islands (n=19) were compared to
   previously published sequences of Tursiops spp., representing four
   phylogenetic units currently recognized within the genus. Phylogenetic
   reconstructions confirm that the smaller coastal form in Melanesia
   belongs to the same phylogenetic unit as T. aduncus populations in the
   Pacific, but differs from T. aduncus in Africa, and that the larger more
   oceanic form belongs to the species T. truncatus. Analyses of population
   diversity reveal high levels of regional population structuring among
   the two forms, with contrasting levels of diversity. From a conservation
   perspective, genetic isolation of T. aduncus in the Solomon Islands
   raises further concern about recent impacts of the commercial,
   live-capture export industry. Furthermore, the low level of mtDNA
   diversity in T. aduncus of New Caledonia suggests a recent population
   bottleneck or founder effect and isolation. This raises concerns for the
   conservation status of these local populations.

AB The final closure of the Isthmus of Panama at approximately 3.5 Ma
   divided the American tropical ocean into two separate and different
   oceanographic regions. Consequences for the marine biota were profound,
   but, hitherto, correlation of the Pacific and Caribbean coastal sections
   has not been precise enough to track biologic patterns. We present here
   a correlation of 31 sections from the Pacific and Caribbean coasts of
   Costa Rica and western Panama. Using calcareous nannofossils and
   planktonic foraminifera at both the tops and bottoms of each formation,
   we estimate that the Caribbean section ranges from 8.2 Ma to 1.7 Ma; and
   the Pacific sequence, from 3.6 Ma to <1.7 Ma. These intervals bracket
   postulated dates for final closure of the Isthmus and provide the first
   well-dated record of middle and late Pliocene faunas from the region.
   The Caribbean and Pacific sections include very different environments
   of deposition, yet there is sufficient overlap and diversity of habitats
   to permit meaningful biological comparisons. On the Caribbean side,
   formations tied together by the overlap of the upper Pliocene markers
   Sphenolithus abies and Pseudo-emiliana lacunosa (3.5 Ma to 3.6 Ma) range
   from very shallow to shallow inner shelf (<200 m) and upper slope
   (200-800 m). The Pacific coast sections were mostly deposited in a
   trench slope environment, which is absent on the Caribbean side. These
   sections fortuitously include abundant thick intra-formational slumps
   containing shallow-water fauna more appropriate for biological
   comparison with the Caribbean biota. Similarly, the approximately 1.9 Ma
   to 1.5 Ma interval, well constrained by various taxa, includes middle-
   to outer-shelf, and inner-shelf to upper-slope deposits on the Caribbean
   side, and marginal-marine to inner-shelf deposits on the Pacific coast.
   Using our new biostratigraphic framework to correlate previously poorly
   constrained mollusc collections, we show that evolutionary divergence of
   the Pacific and Caribbean near-shore marine faunas had occurred by 3.5
   Ma. This strongly suggests that the Isthmus was effectively closed by
   this time.

   Forest which is the highest species diversity for bats reported from any
   protected area in the world. There are, however, few tropical sites that
   have relatively complete inventories. A summary for bat species
   diversity in southern Venezuela, Guyana, Suriname, and French Guiana
   indicates that at least 146 species of bats are known from the Guianan
   subregion. Intense inventory surveys, especially in the often neglected
   subcanopy, suggest that species richness is probably underestimated in
   most Neotropical areas. Likewise, species-level diversity in the Guianan
   subregion is higher than previously suggested. Surveying and monitoring
   biodiversity are critical to developing a National Protected Areas

AB In 1974 petrodollars helped to boost living standards for many of the
   population of the Republic of Trinidad and Tobago.  Yet, a failure to
   address the consequences of uncontrolled urbanization, especially in and
   around the capital, Port of Spain, threatens to undermine further
   improvements in the quality of Trinidadian life.  Trinidad's
   urbanization has been associated with upward social mobility and a
   burgeoning middle class, such that social aspirations and spatial
   mobility tend to coincide.  Thus, internal migration has involved a
   heterogeneous mixture of classes with the common denominator being a
   desire to improve one's standard of living.  For most this means
   residence in or proximity to Port of Spain, the country's commercial,
   administrative, and cultural hub.  Migration into and within Port of
   Spain and northwest corridors of West and East St. George County has
   contributed to several tricky problems, overwhelming regional planning
   efforts, inflating the costs of houses and land, and accelerating social
   alienation among urban Trinidadians.  Problems could have been eased if
   government planning had given adequate recognition to spatial variations
   in societal organization, regional economic structures, and resource
   distribution.  Trinidad changed markedly in the years 1974-81.  New
   wealth has brought its own problems and old problems have worsened for
   lack of attention.  The idea of decentralized growth poles at Sangre
   Grande, Point Fortin, La Brea, and Guayaguayare-Galeota now seems
   impossible to realize.  The Capital region has for 10 years been
   absorbing a larger share of the population, now roughly half the total. 
   It generates virtually all the island's employment opportunities and
   attracts the lion's share of private sector investment.  Overcrowding in
   residences, unsanitary drainage, shortages of potable water, traffic
   congestion, and air pollution all have reduced the quality of life
   compared to 10 years ago.  From 1974 onward the issue of economic
   development no longer focused on whether or not local or foreign
   financial resources could be mobilizied, but rather how this huge
   financial surplus would be deployed to encourage a diversified and
   interdependent econmy with longterm sustainable capacities to absorb and
   provide for Trinidadian and Tobagonian workers and their dependents. 
   The Prime Minister's model of state capitalism failed to generate
   sufficient output and economic vigor to enable Trinidad's economy to
   withstand the 1981-83 recession.  The high level of government
   involvement in running the economy has not meant centralized regulation
   or even coordination of state enterprises.  Final discussion turns to
   the internal migration and growth of the capital region, the preeminence
   of Port of Spain, land and housing problems, and the inflationary spiral
   in land and housing prices.

AB Marine biodiversity in the Coral Triangle is several times higher than
   anywhere else, but why this is true is unknown because of poor
   historical data. To address this, we compared the first available record
   of fossil cheilostome bryozoans from Indonesia with the previously
   sampled excellent record from the Caribbean. These two regions differ
   several-fold in species richness today, but cheilostome diversity was
   strikingly similar until the end of the Miocene 5.3 million years ago so
   that the modern disparity must have developed more recently. However,
   the Miocene faunas were ecologically very different, with a greater
   proportion of erect and free-living species in the Caribbean compared to
   the less well-known Coral Triangle. Our results support the hypothesis
   that modern differences in diversity arose primarily from differential
   extinction of Caribbean erect and free-living species concomitant with
   oceanographic changes due to the uplift of the Isthmus of Panama, rather
   than exceptional rates of diversification in the Indo-Pacific.

AB Marine arenicolous fungi constitute a valuable resource inhabiting
   deteriorated ecosystems, where diversity is threatened by human-related
   activities. Though, information regarding their genetic diversity
   remains poor. Therefore, the aim of this study was to suggest
   inter-simple sequence repeat (ISSR) primers as an accessible tool to
   conduct screenings of the genetic diversity in marine fungal species,
   using as a model Corollospora maritima sensu lato. Our results
   demonstrated that ISSRs represent an efficient genotyping technique. We
   were able to calculate the standard summary statistics for population
   genetics, indicating that isolates from the Caribbean Sea and the Gulf
   of California harbor high levels of genetic diversity compared to
   isolates from other littorals. (C) 2016 The Mycological Society of

AB Local festivals are usually the highlights on the small island, Tobago,
   West Indies. The street vendors capitalized on the Carnival season where
   they provide a variety of foods and beverages on-demand for masqueraders
   and spectators. Therefore, this study examined food safety and hygienic
   practices by vendors and consumer perception of such practices at the
   Carnival festivals in Tobago. Standard structured questionnaires and
   observational checklists were compiled and administered to 50 vendors
   and 150 consumers at five Carnival events. Each vendor was observed for
   frequency of practices for 15-20min. Consumers were sampled
   systematically (every fifth person encountered) at each event. The
   vendors examined were generally female (70.0%), 41-50 years old (34.0%),
   possessed less than primary education (36.0%), acquired more than 5
   years of experience (44.0%) and were stationary (78.0%). The most common
   food prepared and sold was hot dog (36.0% of all sold foods). Educated
   vendors practised good personal hygiene and on-site food handling,
   whereas the others performed improper practices such as absence of
   aprons and hair covering, wearing of jewellery and handling money while
   serving. Also, vendors displaying valid food badges generally practised
   more proper personal hygiene and food handling than those without
   badges. The majority of the consumers examined were residents of Tobago
   (80.0%), female (74.7%), 21-30 years old (39.3%) and possessed secondary
   education (53.3%). More than half of the consumers purchased foods at
   Carnival events (57.3%). Most (82.7%) who did not purchase stored foods
   in coolers. More than half (58.0%) had seen or read Carnival food safety
   articles in the local newspapers and most (96.0%) were aware that
   illnesses can be transmitted via consumption of food. Additionally, 42
   out of 74 respondents (56.8%), who indicated that they were affected by
   foodborne illness, sought medical help when foodborne illness was
   suspected. However, a mere 13 out of 74 consumers (17.6%), who indicated
   that they were affected by foodborne illness, lodged reports of
   suspected foodborne illness with the local health authority. Younger
   consumers (21-30 years old) mostly read food safety articles and were
   conscious of illness being transmitted via consumption of food. In
   addition, the more educated consumers (tertiary education) indicated
   awareness as well as formal reporting of foodborne illness. Some gaps in
   vendor practices included handling of money while serving (78.0%),
   failure to clean utensils (68.0%) and access to water (48.0%).
   Noteworthy, only visual observation and interviews were utilized in the
   study.

AB The Ladolam hydrothermal system, on Lihir Island, Papua New Guinea,
   hosts one of the youngest and largest gold deposits in the world.
   Several deep ( more than 1 kilometer) geothermal wells were drilled
   beneath the ore bodies to extract water at >275 degrees C and to
   facilitate open-pit mining. Using a titanium down-hole sampler, we
   determined that the deep geothermal brine of magmatic origin contains
   similar to 15 parts per billion gold. At the current gold flux of 24
   kilograms per year, this deposit could have formed within similar to
   55,000 years. The combination of sustained metal flux and efficient
   metal precipitation led to the formation of a giant hydrothermal gold
   deposit in a short period.

AB Ocean fish are an important staple food for many Caribbean persons. Some
   species, however, have high Hg concentration levels and represent a
   significant source of Hg exposure. This study assessed Hg concentrations
   in fish species commonly caught and consumed in Barbados as well as Hg
   exposure of those who work in the fishing industry. Total Hg
   concentrations were measured in 100 fish samples. Human Hg
   concentrations were determined from hair snippets taken from 46 fisher
   folk and fish consumption habits evaluated using interview-administered
   questionnaires. Mercury levels varied by fish species with predatory
   fish species having the highest concentrations. Low Hg concentrations
   were found in dolphinfish (Coryphaena hippurus) and flyingfish
   (Hirundichthys affinis). Reported fish consumption rates were high and
   varied significantly between men and women, 2675 +/- 1600 and 1275 +/-
   600 (g/week), respectively (p = 0.01). The median hair Hg concentration
   was 3.1 +/- 2.3 mu g/g (range: 0.01-15.6 mu g/g) and significantly
   associated with consumption of "high-risk" fish species (p = .02). These
   results show that it is possible to make informed choices concerning
   fish consumption habits in order to maximize benefits while minimizing
   the effect of Hg exposures, especially for sensitive groups such as
   pregnant women and infants.

AB Speleonectes epilimnius (described earlier in this issue), was observed
   at the surface of cave pools and in the laboratory. This unique cave
   habitat for remipedes is described. Videotapes of six live specimens
   shot under a microscope provided the only detailed observations to date
   for feeding, grooming, and resting behaviors for remipedes. During
   feeding, maxillae 1 and 2 held food tightly while repeatedly piercing,
   scratching, and rotating it; they periodically moved food to the
   mandibles, which rapidly chewed off tissue in typical crustacean
   fashion. Peristalsis moved food throughout the midgut and to diverticula
   of trunk segments, but not to the anal segment. Several structures were
   used in grooming. Antenna 1 was groomed by power strokes of anterior
   swimming appendages. Antenna 2 and frontal filaments groomed each other.
   Maxillae 1-2 and maxillipeds groomed the mouth area, posterior third of
   the body, and each other.

AB A new species of Rypticus is described from the Bahamas, Bermuda,
   Florida, and the Caribbean Sea. The species previously has been confused
   with the spotted soapfish, R. subbifrenatus Gill 1861, with which it
   shares a similar pattern of dark spotting on the body. The new species
   differs from R. subbifrenatus in having yellow pigment on the pectoral
   fin and distal portions of the soft dorsal, caudal, and anal fins in
   life (pale in preservative); a different configuration of dark spots on
   the head; usually dark spots on the belly and caudal fin; almost always
   four dorsal-fin spines; and modally 25 total dorsal-fin elements, 15
   pectoral-fin rays, and 23 total caudal-fin rays. The lower jaw typically
   extends further anteriorly beyond the upper jaw in the new species than
   in R. subbifrenatus, and the caudal peduncle is usually narrower. The
   new Rypticus typically inhabits deeper waters than R. subbifrenatus, and
   is commonly found on vertical slopes and walls vs. shallow, flat areas.
   The new species likely would have continued to go unnoticed without
   examination of genetic data, as there was little reason to look further
   at R. subbifrenatus until DNA barcoding revealed two distinct genetic
   lineages within the species. The value of DNA barcoding data in
   systematic studies and the need for increased support of taxonomy are
   highlighted. A neotype for Rypticus subbifrenatus is designated.

AB To determine pseudopterosin composition and concentration in colonies of
   Pseudopterogorgia elisabethae from the islands of San Andres and
   Providencia, we collected fragments of individual colonies at various
   sites and depth ranges around the islands. Chromatographic profiles of
   the polar fraction, particularly those obtained by HPLC-MS analyses,
   allowed us to recognize two different chemotypes. Chemotype 1
   characterized samples from Providencia whereas chemotype 2 characterized
   samples from San Andres. A complex pseudopterosin mixture (compounds
   1-13) characterized chemotype 1. These compounds were isolated by a
   combination of chromatographic methods and identified by spectroscopic
   methods (MS, UV, H-1, and C-13 NMR). We identified the known
   pseudopterosins G and K and seco-pseudopterosin A. We also isolated and
   identified seven new compounds, pseudopterosins P-V, isomers of known
   pseudopterosins. Pseudopterosins G and K were found at concentrations
   ranging between 1 and 3% of the animal dry mass. Pseudopterosins Q and U
   were the major compounds reaching up to 6% of the animal dry mass at
   some locations. Major metabolites in chemotype 2 had a molecular weight
   and fragmentation pattern different from that observed in the
   pseudopterosins, as determined by HPLC-MS. Total pseudopterosin
   concentration in this chemotype was below 3% dry mass at all sites.
   Total pseudopterosin concentration was significantly higher in chemotype
   1, with concentrations ranging between 4 and 20% dry mass. At most
   locations on Providencia, however, total pseudopterosin concentration
   ranged between 11 and 15% dry mass. Concentrations exceed reports from
   other locations in the Caribbean. Furthermore, pseudopterosin
   composition in our samples is quite different from those in specimens of
   P. elisabethae from the Bahamas and Bermuda. Pseudopterosins G, K, and
   P-V are characteristic of P. elisabethae colonies from the island of
   Providencia, while pseudopterosins A-D are characteristic of colonies of
   P. elisabethae from the Bahamas islands, and pseudopterosins E-L have
   been isolated from P. elisabethae from the Bahamas and Bermuda. The
   overall morphology of P. elisabethae can be variable, and chemical
   differences are not correlated to specific morphs. We confirmed the
   species identity of each colony by morphological and sclerite analysis
   and found no significant differences in sclerite dimensions among
   different colonies and chemotypes.

   migrants had higher body mass index and more body fat than their rural
   counterparts, particularly the females. The physical exertion index
   calculated for observed activities using heart rate values was much
   higher in farming activities in the rural area than in sedentary work
   activities in the urban area. In addition, walking time was notably
   shorter in the urban group than in the rural group (118 vs 52 min/day in
   males and 116 vs 29 min/day in females). Consequently, despite the urban
   group spending a shorter time resting and a longer time working, their
   daily physical activity level did not achieve the desirable level
   (1.75-1.80). It is thus necessary for urban residents to increase
   walking time to about 2 h per day, the level observed in their rural
   counterparts.

   species and 83 genera of Rhodophyta, 23 species and 15 genera of
   Phaeophyceae, and 48 species and 25 genera of Chlorophyta. Sixty-two of
   the records are additions to the Samoan flora, bringing the total known
   macro-algal flora for the entire Samoan Archipelago to 360 species and
   subspecific taxa. The following new combinations are made: Hinksia
   van-bosseae (Setchell & Gardner) Skelton and South (previously
   Ectocarpus van-bosseae), Antithamnionella simplex (Dawson) Skelton and
   South (previously Antithamnion simplex), Neosiphonia ferulacea (Suhr ex

   J. Agardh), Neosiphonia howei (Hollenberg in W.R. Taylor) South and
   Skelton (previously Polysiphonia howei Hollenberg in W.R. Taylor), and
   Neosiphonia polyphysa (Kutzing) South and Skelton (previously
   Polysiphonia polyphysa Kutzing. Four species are regarded as recently
   introduced to the Samoan flora: Spatoglossum macrodontum J. Agardh,
   Codium arenicola sp. inedit., Codium geppiorum O. Schmidt and Gracilaria
   ephemera Skelton, South & Millar. Their restriction to the area around
   the Harbour suggests that they were imported on shipping. Two species,
   Kappaphycus alverezii (Doty) Doty ex P. Silva and Eucheuma denticulatum
   (Burman) Collins & Hervey, were deliberately introduced for mariculture
   in the 1980s, but the farming failed and no relicts of these
   introductions have been detected. Ninety-five percent of the flora
   consists of widely distributed species (Western-Central Pacific,
   Indo-Pacific, pan-tropical / -subtropical, and cosmopolitan), and there
   is a very low level of endemism (1.3 %), which, it is suggested, may be
   due to the relatively young age of the Samoan Archipelago and to its
   position mid-way along the Indo-West Pacific biodiversity gradient.
   Taxonomic, nomenclatural and distributional appraisals of the species
   are presented, together with an iconography of digital images covering
   most species. Comparisons of Samoan specimens with collections from
   other Pacific Island material held in SUVA-A, and historical collections
   from Samoa algae held in UC and BISH, are also made to expand the scope
   of the treatments. Voucher material of all collections has been
   deposited in SUVA-A, with duplicates to be deposited in BISH.

AB Dietary change in Micronesia has led to serious problems of vitamin A
   deficiency and other nutritionally-related health problems. It is
   essential to identify nutrient-rich indigenous foods that may be
   promoted for health improvements. Giant swamp taro (Cyrtosperma
   merkusii) is important for food and culture on atoll and mountainous
   islands of Micronesia. There are many Cyrtosperma cultivars, but few
   have been analyzed for nutrient content. Samples were collected in the
   Federated States of Micronesia (Pohnpei, Chuuk and Yap) and the Republic
   of Palau, assessed for corm flesh color and other attributes, and
   analyzed for carotenoids (beta- and alpha-carotene, beta-cryptoxanthin,
   lutein, zeaxanthin, and lycopene) and minerals (including iron, zinc,
   and calcium). Of 34 cultivars analyzed, beta-carotene concentrations
   varied from 50 to 4486 mu g/100 g. Yellow-fleshed cultivars generally
   contained higher carotenoid concentrations. Of the ten cultivars
   analyzed for mineral content (wet weight basis), substantial
   concentrations of zinc (5.4-46.1 mg/100 g), iron (0.3-0.8 mg/100 g) and
   calcium (121--305mg/100g) were found. All cultivars were acceptable for
   taste and production factors. These carotenoid- and mineral-rich
   cultivars should be considered for promotion in Micronesia and other
   areas for potential health benefits. (C) 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights

AB Groundwater on islands occurs in the form of freshwater lenses that
   serve as an important water resource for local inhabitants. These lenses
   are highly vulnerable to salinization due to natural recharge variations
   and groundwater abstraction. Determining the sustainable yield from
   freshwater lenses is challenging because the lens response during
   drought periods and the long-term effects of pumping are both difficult
   to predict. The exceptionally detailed and long data record for Bonriki
   Island of the Tarawa atoll (Kiribati) made it possible to develop a
   three-dimensional variable-density model of the island. Field data and
   modelling results highlight the strong control of rainfall variability
   and pumping on the temporal dynamics of the freshwater lens. The model
   reproduces the salinity observations in both monitoring and pumping
   wells reasonably well, and provides a rare example of physically based
   island simulation based on an extensive data set. It enables the
   analysis of freshwater volume and fluxes of submarine groundwater
   discharge, which is impossible based on the field observations alone.
   Under natural as well as abstraction conditions, submarine groundwater
   discharge responds rapidly and almost proportionally to recharge.
   Theoretical model scenarios with scaled abstraction rates show that lens
   contraction caused by pumping is a nearly linear function of the total
   pumped volume, whereby the abstraction rate and the timing of depletion
   are approximately inversely proportional. Modelling indicates that when
   monthly recharge inputs fall below around 2500 m(3)/d (i.e., a flux of
   1.7 mm/d) plus the abstraction rate, the lens tends to contract. Thus,
   despite the highly distributed and extensive abstraction network on
   Bonriki Island, a significant amount of recharge is eventually lost to
   submarine groundwater discharge. The long-term freshwater storage trend
   indicates that Bonriki Island's lens is still contracting after 27.5
   years of pumping, and lens thinning is threatening to impact the water
   supply salinity. This means that even permeable, small islands like
   Bonriki may take at least two decades to realise new equilibrium
   conditions that reflect pumping stresses, which is an important
   consideration in assessing the sustainable yield of small islands, in
   particular those less resilient to pumping than Bonriki.

AB Invasive mammals can be important reservoirs for human pathogens. A
   recent study showed that 12% of mongooses carried Salmonella spp. in
   their large intestines. We investigated whether anthropogenic,
   environmental and climatic variables predicted Salmonella status in
   mongooses (Herpestes auropunctatus) in Grenada. Using multivariate
   logistic regression and contingency table analysis, we found that
   increased human density, decreased distance from roads, and low monthly
   precipitation were associated with increased probability of Salmonella
   carriage. Areas with higher human density likely support a higher
   abundance of mongooses because of greater food availability. These areas
   also are a likely source for infection to mongooses due to high
   densities of livestock and rodents shedding Salmonella. The higher
   probability of Salmonella carriage in mongooses during drier months and
   closer to roadsides is likely due to water drainage patterns and limited
   water availability. Although the overall prevalence of Salmonella in
   mongooses was moderate, the strong patterns of ecologic correlates,
   combined with the high density of mongooses throughout Grenada suggest
   that the small Indian mongoose could be a useful sentinel for Salmonella
   surveillance. Its affinity for human-associated habitats suggests that
   the small Indian mongoose is also a risk factor in the maintenance and
   possible spread of Salmonella species to humans and livestock in
   Grenada.

AB Raja Ampat is an archipelago of about 1,500 small islands located
   northwest off the Bird's Head Peninsula of Indonesia's West Papua
   province. It is part of the Coral Triangle, a region recognized as the
   "epicenter'' of tropical marine biodiversity. In the course of a
   large-scale survey on shallow benthic foraminifera we have discovered
   one new genus and five new species of recent miliolid benthic
   foraminifera from the highly diverse reefal and nearshore environments.
   The new fischerinid genus Dentoplanispirinella is characterized by its
   planispiral coiling and by the presence of a simple tooth, that
   differentiate it from Planispirinella Wiesner. It is represented in our
   sample material by the new species Dentoplanispirinella occulta. The
   other four species described herein are Miliolinella moia, Miliolinella
   undina, Triloculina kawea and Siphonaperta hallocki. All new species are
   comparatively rare and occur sporadically in the sample material.
   Detailed morphological descriptions, scanning electron microscopy
   pictures of complete and dissected specimens as well as micro-computed

AB Data collected from hydrographic stations occupied within the Venezuelan
   and Columbian basins of the Caribbean Sea from 1922 through 2003 are
   analyzed to study the decadal variability of deep temperature in the
   region. The analysis focuses on waters below the 1815-m sill depth of
   the Anegada-Jungfern Passage. Relatively dense waters (compared to those
   in the deep Caribbean) from the North Atlantic spill over this sill to
   ventilate the deep Caribbean Sea. Deep warming at a rate of over 0.01
   degrees C decade(-1) below this sill depth appears to have commenced in
   the 1970s after a period of relatively constant deep Caribbean Sea
   temperatures extending at least as far back as the 1920s.
   Conductivity-temperature-depth station data from World Ocean Circulation
   Experiment Section A22 along 66 degrees W taken in 1997 and again in
   2003 provide an especially precise, albeit geographically limited,
   estimate of this warming over that 6-year period. They also suggest a
   small (0.001 PSS-78, about the size of expected measurement biases) deep
   freshening. The warming is about 10 times larger than the size of
   geothermal heating in the region, and is of the same magnitude as the
   average global upper-ocean heat uptake over a recent 50-year period.
   Together with the freshening, the warming contributes about 0.012 m
   decade(-1) of sea level rise in portions of the Caribbean Sea with
   bottom depths around 5000 m. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Plant litter breakdown is a key ecological process in terrestrial and
   freshwater ecosystems. Streams and rivers, in particular, contribute
   substantially to global carbon fluxes. However, there is little
   information available on the relative roles of different drivers of
   plant litter breakdown in fresh waters, particularly at large scales. We
   present a global-scale study of litter breakdown in streams to compare
   the roles of biotic, climatic and other environmental factors on
   breakdown rates. We conducted an experiment in 24 streams encompassing
   latitudes from 47.88 degrees N to 42.88 degrees S, using litter mixtures
   of local species differing in quality and phylogenetic diversity (PD),
   and alder (Alnus glutinosa) to control for variation in litter traits.
   Our models revealed that breakdown of alder was driven by climate, with
   some influence of pH, whereas variation in breakdown of litter mixtures
   was explained mainly by litter quality and PD. Effects of litter quality
   and PD and stream pH were more positive at higher temperatures,
   indicating that different mechanisms may operate at different latitudes.
   These results reflect global variability caused by multiple factors, but
   unexplained variance points to the need for expanded global-scale
   comparisons.

AB This article describes pathways through which trade policy change in two
   Pacific Island countries has contributed to changes in the food supply,
   and thereby to the nutrition transition. The effect of various trade
   policies from 1960 to 2005 on trends in food imports and availability is
   described, and case studies are presented for four foods associated with
   the nutrition transition and chronic disease in the Pacific. Trade
   policies (including liberalization, export promotion, protection of the
   domestic meat industry and support for foreign direct investment) have
   contributed to a reduced availability of traditional staples, and
   increased availability of foods associated with the nutrition
   transition, including refined cereals (particularly polished rice and
   white flour), meat, fats and oils, and processed food products. This
   study suggests that promoting healthier imports and increasing
   production of healthier traditional foods, in both of which trade policy
   has an important effect, has the potential to improve diets and health,
   in conjunction with other public health intervention.

AB Ensuring strong sectorial linkages exist with tourism and other sectors
   in the economy to retain and distribute tourism benefits to communities
   is often the goal of destination planners. While agriculture and tourism
   food linkage is considered, the literature suggests that farmer-hotel
   supply chain relationships are often weak, resulting in economic
   leakages due to high food importation to support the tourism sector,
   particularly in developing tourism destinations. The traditional
   transactional management of hotel supply chains fails to facilitate
   consistent and strong trade between the two sectors. Therefore, a
   service-oriented farmers-hotel supply chain is proposed, which places
   greater value on local food by making the local food part of the service
   experience. Research findings indicated that service-oriented approach
   through value co-creation, valued relationships and leveraging
   intangible resources embedded in local food although not fully exploited
   in this case study presents opportunities to improve and strengthen of
   local food supply chains.

AB Boron concentrations and isotopic compositions were determined for vent
   fluids from 11 sites in arc/back-arc seafloor hydrothermal systems. This
   new dataset allowed a systematic comparison of boron behavior during
   water-rock interaction in different geological settings. In
   sediment-starved hydrothermal systems (e.g., Manus Basin, Izu-Bonin Arc,
   Mariana Trough), end-member fluids showed large variations in boron
   concentration (0.53-1.52 mmol/kg) and delta B-11 value (13.5-29.7%),
   reflecting the interaction of seawater with varied types of rock that
   occur in arc/back-arc settings. Based on the model calculations, the
   boron concentration and delta B-11 value of the fluid are better
   explained by an equilibration between seawater and rock than a mixing
   model. The Chlorine-depleted fluids from phase-separated hydrothermal
   systems (e.g., North Fiji Basin) had low boron concentrations (0.44-0.55
   mmol/kg) and high delta B-11 values (34.5-36.1%). The small
   fractionations of boron and boron isotopes during phase separation
   suggest that these characteristics were acquired during water-rock
   interaction rather than phase separation and segregation processes. The
   fluids from sedimenthosted hydrothermal systems (e.g., Okinawa Trough)
   are characterized by high boron concentrations (3.9-4.8 mmol/kg) and low
   delta B-11 values (2.5-2.9%). These fluids also showed high Cs/B ratios,
   indicating interactions with terrigenous sediments. Model calculations
   demonstrate that the combined evaluation of delta B-11 values and Cs/B
   ratios are useful for a quantitative estimate of sedimentary
   contributions in seafloor hydrothermal systems. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

AB Paratrichosma spp. are capillarid worms that parasitize the abdominal
   skin of crocodiles. They are likely not a threat to crocodiles' health,
   but they affect the skins' commercial value. No successful treatment
   exists against this parasite, and present knowledge of its life cycle is
   limited. Herein we report new information on Paratrichosoma recurvum
   occurrence in wild American crocodiles Crocodylus acutus from Mexican
   Caribbean islands and its relation to environmental (water salinity,
   temperature, climatic events) and biological (body condition) factors.
   The percentage of parasitized crocodiles (30.3%) is among the highest
   recorded in wild crocodilian populations. Small (< 40.8 cm total length
   [TL]) and large (> 270 cm TL) crocodiles are less parasitized, probably
   due to the characteristics of their skin or of the parasite life cycle.
   Two individuals appeared to have eliminated worms naturally between
   their capture and recapture. The thorax-abdomen is the most parasitized
   area of the body of crocodiles. The risk of infection is not associated
   with the sex of the crocodile, but there was a difference in the
   proportion of parasitized crocodiles between sites, which could be
   related to different environmental conditions. The body condition of a
   crocodile does not seem to be affected by the parasite. Climatic events
   and water temperature show no effect on the parasitism of crocodiles,
   but salinity could have an effect. The infection of crocodiles by P.
   recurvum could depend more on an individual's behavior than on
   environmental conditions.

AB Seagrass species and their distributions were recorded from 18
   localities in the tropical and subtropical Pacific. These field
   observations were collated with a review of the recent literature,
   enabling the present distribution patterns of seagrass species in the
   western Pacific to be described and the origin of those species to be
   discussed in relation to the major oceanic currents of the region.
   The major tropical seagrasses of the western Pacific are Thalassia
   hemprichii, Enhalus acoroides, Cymodocea rotundata, C. serrulata,
   Halodule uninervis, Syringodium isoetifolium and Thalassodendron
   ciliatum, with T. hemprichii and E. acoroides being the two most widely
   distributed species. Species are found in coastal waters along the
   Equatorial Countercurrent and the Kuroshio and East Australian Currents.
   The highest number of seagrass species occurs in the coastal waters of
   Malesia enclosed by Indonesia, Borneo, Papua New Guinea and the Torres
   Strait (northern Australia). This area is considered to be the source of
   all of the seagrass species of the western Pacific, i.e. the centre of
   their origin. A relationship between the distance from this centre of
   origin along the above three major ocean currents and the diversity of
   seagrass species was found: the further from the origin, the poorer the
   seagrass diversity. These observations support the centre-of-origin
   theory that was first proposed by den Hartog to describe the processes
   responsible for the present distribution patterns of seagrasses in the
   western Pacific.

AB As part of ongoing revisionary work on Antillean Megaionychidae, we
   document four new sloth species from Quaternary cave localities in Haiti
   and the Dominican Republic. The new taxa and their tribal affiliations
   are as follows: Megalocnus zile (Megalocnini), Acratocnus ye
   (Acratocnini), and Neocnus dousman and N. toupiti (Cubanocnini).
   Significantly, each is closely related to species in genera long known
   from Cuba. This observation is of primary biogeographical importance
   because the most parsimonious explanation for the presence of parallel
   arrays of lower-level clades of sloths on opposite sides of the Windward
   Passage is vicariance, not a series of uncoordinated over-water
   dispersals. For a brief period in the late Paleogene, eastern Cuba,
   northern Hispaniola, Puerto Rico, and the Aves Rise formed a large
   positive structure (GAARlandia) that was evidently briefly continuous
   with northwestern South America. We infer that the later subdivision and
   subsidence of major portions of GAARlandia must have finely vicariated
   its biota (which included sloths at least as early as the Early
   Oligocene). On this argument, Megalocnus, Acratocnus, Neocnus, and
   Parocnus (= Mesocnus) must have already been in existence as independent
   clades at the time of origin of the Windward Passage (early Neogene),
   because cladistically diagnosable members of these taxa occur in
   Quaternary contexts in both Cuba and Hispaniola. This interpretation is
   consistent with several new lines of evidence concerning the
   paleontological and paleogeographical history of the Caribbean region.

AB Breadfruit (Artocarpus altilis and A. mariannensis) is considered the
   most important staple crop in Kiribati, as a source of carbohydrates and
   other nutritional benefits. Non-food uses include medicine, firewood,
   timber for house and canoe construction, organic composting and
   livestock fodder. Breadfruit production is affected adversely by
   environmental and pest and disease problems. Fruit rots reduced yields
   on 'Bukiraro' by 70% in 2000. Consumption, especially among I-Kiribati
   youth, has decreased, primarily due to modern lifestyle changes. The
   Agriculture Division, Ministry of Environment, Lands and Agricultural
   Development's production activities and programmes have significantly
   contributed to improving breadfruit production, management, diversity
   and conservation. The Division's promotion of pruning methods resulted
   in the adoption of this method by about 40% of Kiribati breadfruit tree
   growers, improving disease and pest control, and increasing harvests.
   New breadfruit cultivars that perform and produce well under atoll
   conditions have been introduced into Kiribati, with the potential to
   create year-round fruiting. This paper describes the Division's
   programmes, outcomes and recommendations for additional needs to
   continue improving the status of breadfruit in Kiribati.

AB In order to demonstrate how scleractinian corals contribute to marine
   biodiversity by their host function, information on associated fauna was
   gathered during a biological survey at St. Eustatius, eastern Caribbean.
   This knowledge is especially urgent for a host coral such as Helioseris
   cucullata (Agariciidae), which has undergone strong declines in
   abundance at various Caribbean localities and has a poor record of
   associated fauna. New records of H. cucullata as host are presented for
   the coral gall crab Opecarcinus hypostegus (Cryptochiridae), the
   Christmas tree worm Spirobranchus giganteus (Serpulidae) and an
   unidentified serpulid tube worm of the genus Vermiliopsis. A second
   association record is reported for the coral barnacle Megatrema
   madreporarum (Pyrgomatidae). Coral-associated copepods were not found on
   H. cucullata despite a search for these animals. The new records were
   compared with previous records of other host coral species that showed
   elements of the same associated fauna. The present findings indicate
   that new discoveries concerning Caribbean coral reef biodiversity can
   still be made during field expeditions by targeting the assemblages of
   associated fauna of specific benthic host species.

   species are now present in the four geomorphological zones of this reef:
   the low-relief spur-and-groove zone, the inner reef slope, the outer
   ridge, and the fore-reef slope (to a depth of 30 m). Five species are
   new additions to the sponge fauna reported for Belize, and six species
   account for 42.6% of the total assemblage: Niphates erecta (9.60%),
   Aiolochroia crassa (8.8%), Niphates digitalis (6.9%), Callyspongia
   plicifera (6.63%), Aplysina archeri (5.37%) and Xestospongia muta
   (5.37%). Species richness, average density, diversity and evenness
   indexes are statistically similar in these four zones but some species
   appear to be more dominant in certain areas. In the same 30 years, coral
   cover has decreased by more than 90%, while the octocoral cover has
   greatly increased (by as much as 10-fold in the low-relief
   spur-and-groove zone). Thus the Carrie Bow fore reef appears to be
   undergoing a transition from coral dominance in the late 1970s to algae
   dominance today, with other benthic groups such as sponges and
   octocorals showing signs of gradual recovery.

AB Paleotropical islands are experiencing extensive land-use change, yet
   little is known about how such changes are impacting wildlife in these
   biodiversity hotspots. To address this knowledge gap, we characterized
   bat responses to forest conversion in a biodiverse, human-threatened
   coastal rainforest habitat on Makira, Solomon Islands. We analysed
   similar to 200 h of acoustic recordings from echolocating bats in the
   four dominant types of land use on Makira: intact forest, secondary
   forest, food gardens and cacao plantations. Bat calls were identified to
   the species level using a supervised classification model (where
   labelled data are used to train the system). We examined relative
   activity levels and morphological traits across habitats. Relative
   activity levels were highest in intermediately disturbed habitats and
   lowest in the most heavily disturbed habitat, although these differences
   were not significant. There were significant differences in the mean
   forearm length of bat assemblages across habitats, with the highest mean
   forearm length found in the most open habitat (Cacao). Overall, our
   study constitutes the first detailed exploration of anthropogenic
   effects on mammalian diversity in the Solomon Islands and includes the
   first acoustic and morphological information for many bat species in
   Melanesia. We use our experience to discuss the challenges of acoustic
   monitoring in such a remote and poorly studied region.

AB While not well-known or well-studied, Grenada's (Caribbean) Carib Stones
   host over 100 individual petroglyphs (rock engravings) representing some
   of the Caribbean's best examples. Two sites were assessed for this
   study: Duquesne Bay along the northwest Caribbean coast and Mt. Rich in
   the northern tropical rainforest. Their importance notwithstanding,
   little has been done to manage or assess the Stones other than basic
   glyph recording. This study employed the Rock Art Stability Index (RASI)
   to assess and document each panel's overall geologic stability. Using
   more than three-dozen rock decay elements, RASI represents an efficient
   and rapid tool to assess petroglyphs and pictographs, assigning an
   "Excellent-Good-Problems-Urgent Danger-Great Danger-Severe Danger"
   ranking based on a quantitative score. Overall, 13 panels were assessed
   individually, with a few exhibiting "Good" status, two in "Great
   Danger", and the remaining exhibiting "Problems". Analyses show the
   Duquesne Bay site remains at the behest of its proximity to water, such
   as stagnating puddles, waves, or storm and household runoff. In
   contrast, the Mt. Rich site receives substantial rainfall and remains
   under rainforest canopy, yet is significantly more stable. This research
   demonstrates the need for further monitoring efforts and lays the
   groundwork for continued study and assessment of the Carib Stones, while
   at the same time raising their profile to the international stage in
   hopes of securing greater recognition ultimately leading to better
   management practices. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Nothofagus subgenus Brassospora now occurs only in New Guinea and New
   Caledonia, but is well known from fossil deposits of South America, New
   Zealand, Antarctica and Australia. It is commonly used for
   palaeoclimatic interpretation, but the climate characteristics of the
   extant species have not been described. In this paper we used the
   climatic estimation software, BIOCLIM, to derive a climate profile of 24
   variables for each of the 14 species of Nothofagus native to New Guinea,
   and lapse rates and isohyet maps to describe the annual mean temperature
   and rainfall range of the five species native to New Caledonia. The New
   Guinea species occur at annual mean temperatures ranging from 10.6 to
   23.5 degrees C, with annual precipitation of 1762-7733 mm. The first
   three axes of a principal components analysis explained 85 % of the
   total variation, the first axis comprising temperature variables, the
   second comprising precipitation range and precipitation of the wet
   season, and the third axis comprising dry-season precipitation and
   annual and diurnal temperature range. Some species had distinct
   combinations of positions along these component axes, indicating clear
   niche differentiation with respect to climate. The New Caledonian
   species occur at annual mean temperatures of 14.5-23.5 degrees C, and
   annual precipitation of c. 1500-3500 mm. Although there was no
   signifcant difference in annual mean temperature and precipitation
   between the New Guinea and New Caledonian species, comparison of median
   values across species suggests specialisation of most New Caledonian
   species towards slightly drier conditions than the New Guinea species
   that occur at similarly high annual mean temperatures. Use of subgenus
   Brassospora to interpret palaeoclimates should take into account the
   variation in climate experienced across the range of extant species.

AB The tropical river ocean processes in coastal settings (TROPICS) program
   in Indonesia (Indotropics) was carried out in the Mamberamo estuary on
   May-June 1999 and August 2000. The Mamberamo River flows northward from
   the high mountains of West Papua to the narrow and steep continental
   slope of the Pacific Ocean. The data for the 1999 Mamberamo estuary
   cruises show the dispersal of fresh water coming out of the Mamberarno
   River into the Bismarck Sea, and the plume is clearly defined by the
   pattern of salinity, turbidity, and nutrient distribution. The Mamberamo
   River and other nearby rivers supply high concentrations of phosphate
   and nitrate to the New Guinea Coastal Current, so that nutrient
   concentrations are higher in the surface estuarine plume, compared to
   offshore areas. The distribution of fishes and benthic animals were also
   sampled over this area. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

   as currently delineated. We introduce the new tribe Amphidurini and the
   new genus Neogyptis to accommodate these new findings. Amphidurini is
   sister to Gyptini and Ophiodromini and includes Amphiduros Hartman,
   1959, Amphiduropsis, Pleijel, 2001, Neogyptis gen. nov., and, possibly,
   Parahesione Pettibone, 1956. Morphologically, Amphidurini can be
   separated from Gyptini by the distally, rather than subdistally,
   inserted ventral cirri, and Neogyptis by the combination of this
   feature, the presence of a median antenna, and a distal ring with
   papillae on the proboscis. We redescribe and transfer the four species
   Gyptis crypta Pleijel, 1993, Gyptis mediterranea Pleijel, 1993, Gyptis
   plurisetis Hilbig, 1992, and Gyptis rosea (Malm, 1874) from Gyptis to

AB The Small Island Developing States are characterized by an unstable
   economy and low-lying, densely populated cities, resulting in a high
   vulnerability to natural hazards. Flooding affects more people than any
   other hazard. To limit the consequences of these hazards, adequate risk
   assessments are indispensable. Satisfactory input data for these
   assessments are hard to acquire, especially in developing countries.
   Therefore, in this study, a methodology was developed and evaluated to
   test the sensitivity of a flood model towards its input data in order to
   determine a minimum set of indispensable data. In a first step, a flood
   damage assessment model was created for the case study of Annotto Bay,
   Jamaica. This model generates a damage map for the region based on the
   flood extent map of the 2001 inundations caused by Tropical Storm
   Michelle. Three damages were taken into account: building, road and crop
   damage. Twelve scenarios were generated, each with a different
   combination of input data, testing one of the three damage calculations
   for its sensitivity. One main conclusion was that population density, in
   combination with an average number of people per household, is a good
   parameter in determining the building damage when exact building
   locations are unknown. Furthermore, the importance of roads for an
   accurate visual result was demonstrated.

AB Biodiversity conservation planning requires trade-offs, given the
   realities of limited resources and the competing demands of society. If
   net benefits for society are important, biodiversity assessment cannot
   occur without other sectoral factors "on the table". In trade-offs
   approaches, the biodiversity value of a given area is expressed in terms
   of the species or other components of biodiversity that it has that are
   additional to the components protected elsewhere. That "marginal gain"
   is called the complementarity value of the area. A recent whole-country
   planning study for Papua New Guinea illustrates the importance of
   complementarity-based tradeoffs in determining priority areas for
   biodiversity conservation, and for designing economic instruments such
   as biodiversity levies and offsets. Two international biodiversity
   programs provide important new opportunities for biodiversity trade-offs
   taking complementarity into account. Both the Millennium Ecosystem
   Assessment and the Critical Ecosystems or "hotspots" programs can
   benefit from an explicit framework that incorporates tradeoffs, in which
   a balance is achieved not only by land-use allocation among areas, but
   also by the crediting of partial protection of biodiversity provided by
   sympathetic management within areas. For both international programs,
   our trade-offs framework can provide a natural linkage between local,
   regional and global planning levels.

AB The shrew Crocidura thomensis is a little-known species endemic to Sao
   Tome Island. We review its distribution, ecology and conservation status
   based on nine published and.. new records. The species has a wide
   distribution across Sao Tome, preferring rugged forested areas with high
   rainfall. The location of new records coincides with that of historical
   records but the proportion of records in plantations has declined,
   possibly as a result of agricultural intensification, increased use of
   pesticides, and presence of exotic species. The shrew is restricted to a
   single island, its extent of occurrence is <1,000 km(2) and its habitat
   is declining in extent and quality, and thus its categorization as
   Endangered on the IUCN Red List remains appropriate. It is important to
   gain a better knowledge of population trends, ecological preferences and
   sensitivity to potential threats, but the effective protection of Sao
   Tome Obo Natural Park and surrounding forests is the most important
   measure to ensure the long-term survival of this mammal.

   Location Motmot, an island in Lake Wisdom which occupies the caldera of
   Long Island, Papua New Guinea.
   Methods Arthropod sampling by means of pitfall, water and tube traps,
   fallout collectors, and hand collecting.
   Results At least thirty-five species of arthropod were collected in 6
   days between 23 June and 3 July 1999. Lycosid spiders and ants dominated
   in all areas. The predator-scavenger arthropod population is largely or
   entirely dependent on allochthonous input of aquatic insects from the
   surrounding lake.
   Main conclusions Major changes in the arthropod fauna since the pioneer
   surveys of Ball and his colleagues in the 1970s are the loss of a strand
   flotsam community as the island has eroded to form a predominantly
   cliffed coastline. Ant and spider diversity has increased. The current
   colonists include a. number of widespread 'tramp' species sensu Diamond.

   new records for the island. Although most taxa represent rather common
   species, which are generally widespread in the Indian and western
   Pacific Ocean, some are of special interest to algal systematists and
   biogeographers. Renouxia antillana is reported for the first time for
   the Indian Ocean. The presence of Renouxia also constitutes the first
   record of the order Rhodogorgonales for the entire Indian Ocean. A few
   species have interesting distribution patterns. Halydictyon sp. is
   restricted in its distribution to South Africa, Mauritius and Australia.
   Despite these interesting records, the red algal flora of Rodrigues is
   most remarkable by the absence of several 'ubiquitous' species.

   terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism (T-RFLP) analysis. The
   least number of bacterial ribotypes and bacterial isolates were
   retrieved from Bahamas reference and sponge surfaces, while the
   bacterial communities from Hong Kong Callyspongia sp. and reference
   surfaces were more diverse. Microbial communities from the 2 sponges
   were different from each other and from reference substrata. Gas
   chromatographic-mass spectrometric (GC-MS) analysis of dichloromethane
   extracts revealed that more than 60% of the compounds were similar in
   the 2 species Callyspongia sp. and C, plicifera, compared to the
   compounds of Halichondria spp. At tissue level (TL) concentrations, both
   sponge extracts predominantly inhibited the growth of bacteria from
   reference substrata. Multifactor ANOVA revealed that the source of
   bacteria (sponge surface, interior, or reference substrata), the
   geographic location of isolates (Hong Kong or the Bahamas), the sponge
   extract (from Callyspongia sp. or from C. plicifera), and combinations
   of these factors contributed significant effects in disc diffusion assay
   experiments. Sponge extracts at both TL concentrations and 10x dilutions
   were toxic to larvae of the polychaete Hydroides elegans and the
   barnacle Balanus amphitrite. Our results suggest that the 2 congeneric
   sponges Callyspongia spp. from different biogeographic regions have
   different bacterial associates, while producing relatively similar
   secondary metabolites. It remains to be explored whether differences in
   sponge-associated bacterial communities will also hold for other
   congeneric sponge species from different regions.

   presented to add to the body of evidence supporting this as an important
   characteristic of the genus. The generic placement of Granulina
   mamanucensis sp. nov. is discussed in depth. Gibberula marinae sp. nov.
   is considered to be a member of the group 'philippi', a widespread group
   of small white shelled Gibberula with variable animal chromatism.
   Gibberula vomoensis sp. nov., an extremely small species with an unusual

AB The distributions and growth patterns of Symmetroscyphus intermedius,

   Thalassia testudinum from South Water Cay, Belize were examined.
   Colonies of S. intermedius and T. tumida smaller than 3 cm and 4 cm
   respectively grew up and down the leaves, but larger colonies of both
   species grew only downward. Downward growth has three main advantages;
   it maximizes the residence time on the leaves, which grow upward from a
   basal meristem and disintegrate or are grazed from the tip, it reduces
   the potential for interspecific competition with other epiphytes, and it
   places the hydroids in proximity to short young leaves, which may be
   colonized by vegetative stolons. T. tumida was relatively rare on the
   older leaf sur-faces because of a progressive degeneration of the distal
   hydroid tissue. V. halecioides showed no orientation of hydrorhizal
   growth and was most abundant on the older leaf surfaces, a distribution
   typical of facultative epiphytes. There are close similarities between
   the morphologies, growth patterns and distributions of S. intermedius,
   T. tumida and V. halecioides on Thalassia, and Campanularia asymmetrica,
   Sertularia perpusilla and Aglaophenia harpago respectively on Posidonia

AB Phylogenetic relationships of symbiotic dinoflagellate lineages,
   distributed in all tropical and subtropical seas, suggest strategies for
   long distance dispersal but at the same time strong host specialization.
   Zooxanthellae (Symbiodinium: Dinophyta), which are associated to diverse
   shallow-water cnidarians, also engage in symbioses with some sponge
   species of the genus Cliona. In the Caribbean, zooxanthellae-bearing
   Cliona has recently become abundant due to global warming, overfishing,
   and algae abundance. Using molecular techniques, the symbionts from five
   excavating species (Cliona caribbaea, C. tenuis, C. varians, C. aprica
   and C. laticavicola) from the southern and southwestern Caribbean were
   surveyed. Several DNA sequence regions were used in order to confirm
   zooxanthellae identity; 18S rDNA, domain V of chloroplast large subunit
   (cp23S), internal transcribed spacer 2 (ITS2), and ITS2 secondary
   structure. Sequence analyses corroborated the presence of three
   zooxanthellae clades: A, 13, and G. Presence of clades A and B in common
   boring sponges of the Caribbean fit with the general pattern of the
   province. The discovery of clade G for the first time in any organism of
   the Atlantic Ocean leads us to consider this unusual finding as a
   phylogenetic relict through common ancestors of sponge clades or an
   invasion of the sponge from the Indo-Pacific. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc. All

AB [1] The highstanding islands of Oceania are recognized as a source of
   significant particulate organic carbon delivered to nearshore marine
   environments. The existing data on carbon export in Oceania are largely
   derived from small mountainous watersheds (< 10,000 km(2)) with little
   or no sediment storage capacity and located in subtropical to temperate
   regions. The Fly-Strickland fluvial dispersal system is the largest in
   tropical Oceania and has high sediment yields, aged organic matter in
   its suspended-sediment load, and lowland sediment storage capacity. The
   Fly River system also has very high soil organic carbon content and
   conditions favorable to perennially high production, oxidation, and
   discharge within the watershed. We used stable and radiogenic isotopes (
   delta(13)C, Delta(14)C, and delta(15)N), lignin phenols, and X-ray
   photoelectron spectroscopy to examine the organic and inorganic
   composition of particulate and dissolved carbon at several lowland sites
   in the Fly and Strickland rivers and on the Strickland River floodplain.
   Isotopic, elemental, and biomarker results suggest that organic carbon
   in the Strickland River was more degraded than in the Fly River, with a
   greater input of ancient organics from upland sources, and that aquatic
   production constituted a larger source in the Fly River. Radiocarbon
   results indicate that all carbon fractions were older in the Strickland
   than in the Fly and that Strickland floodplain sediments were also
   depleted in radiocarbon. Collectively, these results suggest that rivers
   of New Guinea export a comparable amount of particulate organic carbon
   to the Amazon, with a significant contribution from radiocarbon-depleted
   sources.

   particularly in terms of the herpetofauna present. yet surprisingly
   little is known about the parasites that infect these organisms. A
   survey of diverse scinid and agamid lizard hosts from this country
   showed a diversity of malaria parasites infecting these hosts. We
   combined morphological and morphometric observations of the parasites
   (primarily gametocytes) along with DNA sequence data from the
   mitochondrial cytochrome h and cytochrome oxidase I genes and here
   describe 4 new species of Plasmodium, i.e. Plasmodium minuoviride n.
   sp., Plasmodium koreafense n. sp., Plasmodium megalotrypa n. sp.. and
   Plasmodium gemini it. sp. A fifth species, Plasmodium lacertiliae
   Thompson and Hart 1946, is redescribed based on new observations of
   hosts and localities and additional molecular data. This combined
   morphological and molecular approach is advised for all future
   descriptions of new Malaria parasite species. particularly in light or
   situations where every life-history stage is not available.

AB A meeting in Singapore of principal investigators from 7 countries in a
   WHO collaborative study on hypertensive disease of pregnancy, also
   called pre-eclampsia or eclampsia, pointed out women at risk, suggested
   management guidelines, and summarized operations research projects
   involving administration of aspirin or calcium supplements. 
   Hypertensive disease of pregnancy may ultimately end in fatal seizures. 
   It is often marked by warning signs of severe headaches and facial and
   peripheral edema.  A survey in Jamaica found that 0.72% of a group of
   10,000 pregnant women had eclamptic seizures.  These were the cause of
   almost one-third of all obstetric deaths in the period 1981-1983.  10.4%
   of the pregnant women had hypertension, and half of these had
   proteinuria.  Associated risk factors were primigravida, age 30,
   abnormal weight gain, edema, 1+ proteinuria.  A phased program of
   management guidelines for identifying and treating affected women is
   being instituted in half of Jamaica's parishes.  An operations research
   project involves administration of low-dose aspirin vs. placebo. 
   Another controlled trial, in Peru, is testing calcium supplements.  A
   third trial in Argentina will compare 2 drug regimens.

   all western Atlantic species that have a cirrus on their anterior
   nostrils. Three deep-water species lacking nasal cirri are also treated,
   including O. leprocarus n. sp. (Bahamas and Lesser Antilles), O.
   melachasme (Yucatan), and O. nothus n. sp. (North Carolina, Gulf of
   Mexico and Cuba); the latter two species were originally thought to
   represent different sexes of the same species. The O. macrognathus
   species group is diagnosed primarily by having sexually dimorphic jaws
   and sexually dichromatic maxillary markings, and includes the eastern
   Pacific O. scops and the following live western Atlantic species: O.
   macrognathus (Florida, Gulf of Mexico, and Bahamas to northern South
   America), O. brasiliensis n. sp. (southern Brazil), O. cuverii (southern
   Brazil), O. robinsi n. sp. (South Carolina, Florida, Bahamas, and Gulf
   of Mexico), and O. signatus n. sp. (Nicaragua, Panama, and northern
   South America). Opistognathus robinsi and O. signatus are very similar
   morphologically and here recognized as allopatric sister-species but the
   possibility exists that their disjunct continental distributions may be
   a collecting artifact. The broadly distributed and shallow-water species
   Opistognathus whitehurstii and O. maxillosus are superficially similar
   to some members of the O. macrognathus species group, including having
   cirri on their anterior nostrils, but differ most obviously in having
   non-sexually dimorphic jaws and more numerous cephalic sensory pores. An
   identification key is provided for all known western Atlantic species of

AB The land use system on Tikopia - a Polynesian outlier in Solomon Islands
   - is analyzed to determine how it has developed since it was first
   described in the 1930s and again in the 1970s. Fieldwork included a
   household questionnaire survey, in-depth interviews on farming practices
   and decision making, and the collection of soil samples from the major
   soil and garden types. The Tikopian land use system has not undergone
   significant changes since the 1970s; indeed the focus on
   self-sufficiency in food crops may have been strengthened over the past
   30 years as ship arrivals have become increasingly unreliable. Local
   agricultural production and exploitation of marine resources are
   essential to sustain the population, and with few exceptions farming and
   fishing techniques remain unchanged. Most of the island is still farmed
   permanently and the intensive agricultural system has not suffered
   long-term setbacks, not even from extreme events such as Cyclone Zoe in
   2002. The high fertility of Tikopian soils reported in the 1960s was
   found to be unchanged. It is concluded that the land use system is
   highly resilient to shocks and that there are no indications that
   Tikopian villagers would not be able to support their subsistence in the
   future, provided there is no substantial increase in the resident (de
   facto) population.

   characterization of this snail is presented, in respect of the shell,
   radula and copulatory organ.  It is compared with B. forskalii
   populations sampled on the African mainland (Nigeria, Cameroon, Gabon
   and Angola) and with related taxa.  Despite differences in the shell
   from the commonly found form of B. forskalii it seems appropriate to
   identify the Sao Tome population as an extreme conchological variant of
   this taxon.

AB The identification of the lebranche mullet in the western south Atlantic
   has long been problematical. In most recent works either Mugil liza
   Valenciennes and M. platanus Gunther, 1880 or M. liza and M. cephalus
   Linnaeus, 1758 were recognized from the region and more rarely the
   occurrence of only one species has been proposed but without sufficient
   morphological, biochemical or molecular data to allow the designation of
   the taxonomically appropriate name. Analysis of meristic and
   morphometric data taken from samples collected from Venezuela to
   Argentina, clearly indicates that there is only one species of lebranche
   mullet in the Caribbean Sea region and the Atlantic coast of South
   America and that Mugil liza is the appropriate name. The comparison of
   the combined data from all the samples of M. liza with the data taken
   from one sample of M. cephalus that originated in the Mediterranean, the
   possible locality from which type specimens were collected (Eschmeyer
   and Fricke, 2009), revealed significant differences indicating that they
   are different species. It is also suggested that individuals from the
   western north Atlantic identified as M. cephalus might represent a
   population of M. liza in this region.

AB Coconut-based agroforestry systems have a central role in livelihoods on
   Malo Island in the South Pacific. These mixed plantations provide
   households with both food and a cash income, thanks to the association
   in space and time of root crops, vegetables, and cash crops (coconut,
   cocoa and vanilla). Vanilla has been developed on the island since the
   year 2000. Farmers have tried to adapt their production systems to
   include it, with some choosing to do so by associating vanilla with
   their main cash crop, coconut. A survey of these innovative practices
   and their economic results conducted in 2005 resulted in an economic
   modelling of this new agroforestry system with the software Olympe. This
   study illustrates the use of economic modelling with Olympe to simulate
   and test new agricultural practices in complex agroforestry systems. The
   software proved to suit agroforestry systems very well and provided
   useful information, particularly on economic aspects.

AB Tropical stream food webs are thought to be based primarily on
   terrestrial resources (leaf litter) in small forested headwater streams
   and algal resources in larger, wider streams. In tropical island
   streams, the dominant consumers are often omnivorous freshwater shrimps
   that consume algae, leaf litter, insects, and other shrimps. We used
   stable isotope analysis to examine (1) the relative importance of
   terrestrial and algal-based food resources to shrimps and other
   consumers and determine (2) if the relative importance of these food
   resources changed along the stream continuum. We examined delta(15)N and
   delta(13)C signatures of leaves, algae, macrophyles, biofilm, insects,
   snails, fishes, and shrimps at three sites (300, 90, and 10 In elev.)
   along the Rio Espiritu Santo, which drains the Caribbean National
   Forest, Puerto Rico. Isotope signatures of basal resources were distinct
   at all sites. Results of two-source delta(13)C mixing models suggest
   that shrimps relied more on algal-based carbon resources than
   terrestrially derived resources at all three sites along the continuum.
   This study supports other recent findings in tropical streams,
   demonstrating that algal-based resources are very important to stream
   consumers, even in small forested headwater streams. This study also
   demonstrates the importance of doing assimilation-based analysis (i.e.,
   stable isotope or trophic basis of production) when studying food webs.

TI Implementing REDD plus in Papua New Guinea: Can biodiversity indicators

AB UNFCCC's "Cancun safeguards" (COP 16, 2010) provide a strong call for
   comprehensive steps to prevent harm to biodiversity from Reducing
   Emissions from Deforestation and forest Degradation (REDD+) activities
   and to support its conservation. However, as non-binding "principles"
   and due to their general wording, they are not operational in the
   present form. Additionally, the scientific literature on biodiversity
   monitoring for REDD+ is still very limited, particularly when it comes
   to REDD+ in tropical forests and at the national scale. Whereas some
   authors suggest that biodiversity integration can be achieved by means
   of standardised protocols and techniques, others consider that an
   effective monitoring of biodiversity in tropical forests at the national
   scale may be an impossible task to achieve in a cost-effective way.
   However, recent research offers some functional approaches to tackle the
   many challenges involved. This paper explores the perspectives and
   limits of developing and effectively incorporating appropriate
   biodiversity objectives and indicators in Papua New Guinea's
   multipurpose National Forest Inventory (PNG's NFI). The PNG's NFI is
   currently being designed under the UN-REDD programme as a key component
   of the National Forest Monitoring System that PNG is required to
   establish in order to participate in a future REDD+ mechanism. We
   conclude that the challenge cannot be effectively tackled only at the
   design stage of the NFI, as it needs to address a number of issues
   related to different stages of the REDD+ preparedness process:
   a. If biodiversity integration is carried out directly at the NFI stage,
   it will need to rely on proxies derived from indicators designed to
   monitor carbon stock change;
   b. At the planning stage, a carbon-biodiversity overlay map analysis
   would allow for a preliminary selection of areas of high biodiversity
   that could be threatened by REDD+ activities either directly or
   indirectly through "leakage";
   c. During the implementation stage, the selection could be refined by
   identifying a sub-sample of sites where forests are undergoing the
   greatest changes;
   d. A comprehensive biodiversity monitoring programme involving field
   measurements of key species could only be designed once the priority
   areas have been clearly defined and limited in both number and size.

AB The current conservation status of the bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops
   truncatus) under the IUCN is 'least concern'. However, in the Caribbean,
   small and localized populations of the 'inshore form' may be at higher
   risk of extinction than the 'worldwide distributed form' due to a
   combination of factors including small population size, high site
   fidelity, genetic isolation, and range overlap with human activities.
   Here, we study the population genetic structure of bottlenose dolphins
   from the Archipelago of Bocas del Toro in Panama. This is a small
   population characterized by high site fidelity and is currently
   heavily-impacted by the local dolphin- watching industry. We collected
   skin tissue samples from 25 dolphins to study the genetic diversity and
   structure of this population. We amplified a portion of the
   mitochondrial Control Region (mtDNA-CR) and nine microsatellite loci.
   The mtDNA-CR analyses revealed that dolphins in Bocas del Toro belong to
   the 'inshore form', grouped with the BahamasColombia- Cuba-Mexico
   population unit. They also possess a unique haplotype new for the
   Caribbean. The microsatellite data indicated that the Bocas del Toro
   dolphin population is highly structured, likely due to restricted
   movement patterns. Previous abundance estimates obtained with
   mark-recapture methods reported a small population of 80 dolphins (95%
   CI = 72-87), which is similar to the contemporary effective population
   size estimated in this study (Ne = 73 individuals; CI = 18.0 - infinity;
   0.05). The combination of small population size, high degree of genetic
   isolation, and intense daily interactions with dolphin-watching boats
   puts the Bocas del Toro dolphin to at high risk of extinction. Despite
   national guidelines to regulate the dolphin-watching industry in Bocas
   del Toro and ongoing educational programs for tour operators, only in
   2012 seven animals have died due to boat collisions. Our results suggest
   that the conservation status of bottlenose dolphins in Bocas del Toro
   should be elevated to 'endangered' at the national level, as a
   precautionary measure while population and viability estimates are
   conducted.

AB Phascolion (Isomya) gerardi, a new species of Sipuncula, is described
   from littoral waters of the Bahamas, Belize, and the Yucatan coast of
   Mexico where it inhabits rubble associated with coral reefs. A new
   interstitial species, Phascolion (Phascolion) psammophilum, is described
   from depths of 15-19 m off the coast of east central Florida. It is the
   first sipunculan, documented as an adult rather than juvenile, to be
   reported as a member of the meiofaunal community. Observations on
   development, resulting from laboratory spawnings, reveal a typical
   lecithotrophic trochophore and a short-lived lecithotrophic pelagosphera
   larva that transforms into a crawling juvenile at 4 days of age. Station
   data for these collections are presented in an appendix at the end of
   the paper.

AB Coasts of many low-lying islands will be inundated should sea level rise
   by 1 m by 2100 as projected, thereby decreasing water resources through
   aquifer salinization. A lesser known impact occurs if rising sea level
   elevates water tables above interior topographic lows to form lakes.
   Impacts of lake formation on water resources, however, remain
   unquantified. Here we use hydrological models, based on islands in the
   Bahamian archipelago, to demonstrate that on islands with negative water
   budgets, evaporation following lake inundation can cause more than twice
   the loss of fresh groundwater resources relative to an equivalent amount
   of coastal inundation. This result implies that in dry climates,
   low-lying islands with inland depressions could face substantially
   greater threats to their water resources from sea level rise than
   previously considered.

AB Trap fishing for fishes and lobster is common near coral reefs in the
   Caribbean, but little is known about the effects of these stationary
   gears on targeted habitats. We are in the middle of a multi-year project
   (2001-2005) in the U. S. Virgin Islands, Puerto Rico, and the Florida
   Keys that includes: i) Mapping the distribution of traps relative to
   bottom habitat types via geographical information systems (GIS), ii)
   Quantifying trap densities by predicted versus actual habitat type, and
   iii) Quantifying damage to corals and other structure-providing organ-
   isms. We are examining seasonal and interannual variations in habitat
   use by trap fishers using both apparent trap distributions recorded via
   surface vessel surveys and actual trap distributions recorded by divers
   and underwater photography. Preliminary findings suggest that traps were
   not distributed randomly (in proportion to habitat types available) and
   certain habitat types were targeted. However, a relatively small
   percentage (< 20 %) of the traps set in shallow water (< 30 m) actually
   contacted hard corals, gorgonians, or sponges. Damage occurred mainly to
   hard corals and was patchy, at a scale less than the total trap foot
   print. Almost half of the traps caused no apparent damage. There were
   seasonal shifts in trapping effort and habitats used.

AB The east Pacific warm pool exhibits basic-state variability associated
   with the Madden-Julian oscillation (MJO) and Caribbean low-level jet
   (CLLJ), which affects the development of easterly waves (EWs). This
   study compares and contrasts composite changes in the background
   environment, eddy kinetic energy (EKE) budgets, and EW tracks during MJO
   and CLLJ events. While previous studies have shown that the MJO
   influences jet activity in the east Pacific, the influence of the MJO
   and CLLJ on the east Pacific and EWs is not synonymous. The CLLJ is a
   stronger modulator of the ITCZ than the MJO, while the MJO has a more
   expansive influence on the northeastern portion of the basin. Anomalous
   low-level westerly MJO and CLLJ periods are associated with favorable
   conditions for EW development paralleling the Central American coast,
   contrary to previous findings about the relationship of the CLLJ to EWs.
   Easterly MJO and CLLJ periods support enhanced ITCZ EW development,
   although the CLLJ is a greater modulator of EW tracks in this region,
   which is likely associated with stronger moisture and convection
   variations and their subsequent influence on the EKE budget. ITCZ EW
   growth during easterly MJO periods is more reliant on barotropic
   conversion than during strong CLLJ periods, when eddy available
   potential energy (EAPE)-to-EKE conversion associated with ITCZ
   convection is more important. Thus, the influence of these phenomena on
   east Pacific EWs should be considered distinct.

   April-June (autumn), soon after the reproduction period. The schools
   swim in surface waters with until 80 meters in depth, but more than 98%
   of them are restricted to waters until 50 meters; about 41% of schools
   are found in places of 10 - 20 meters, with clear reduction of their
   frequencies in higher depths; schools with more than 10 tons tend to
   swim in surface waters with 31 - 60 meters in depth. The schools reach
   the maximum size of 95 tons, but around 88% of them do not exceed the 15
   tons; the smaller ones, with until 5 tons, correspond to almost 42% of
   those caught, with frequency reductions as increase their sizes.

   Bahamian flora, and in 1963 he obtained extramural funds to develop a
   living collection focusing on Bahamian plants that was established in
   FTBG. During his tenure FTBG supported the publication of the latest
   comprehensive flora of this archipelago. A project initiated by the
   first FTBG herbarium curator, William Gillis, but published by Donovan
   and Helen Correll (with illustrations of Priscilla Fawcett) in 1982.
   This living collection of Bahamian plants has supplied plant material
   for molecular phylogenetic studies worldwide. There are DNA phylogenies
   for only 10 of the 89 Bahamian endemics; most of the material of these
   phylogenies came from plants from these collections (three species)
   and/or from fragments of herbarium specimens collected by Donovan
   Correll (six species). Only two of the species included in these
   phylogenies are from collections unrelated to FTBG. Excluding species
   restricted to the Bahamas, material from 14 Caribbean Island endemics
   that are part of these collections has been used in phylogenetic
   studies. The available molecular phylogenies show that the Bahamian
   endemics are closely related to species from the West Indies or
   continental areas of the Caribbean Basin. There is also a paucity of
   population genetic studies based on DNA markers focusing on Bahamian
   plants. Only two of the four available population genetic studies are
   for a Bahamian endemic taxon.

AB Cocoa and coffee are among the most valuable tropical crops, with much
   of their production in areas of high biodiversity. Although this could
   suggest a conflict between agricultural expansion and biodiversity
   conservation, these crops are normally grown in shade plantationsa more
   biodiversity-friendly agroforestry system. Using SAo Tome Island as a
   case study, we examined if shade plantation can benefit biodiversity by
   protecting extinction-prone island endemic species. We found that shade
   plantations held rich assemblages, even in comparison with forest: we
   estimated 30 bird and 74 tree species occurring in plantations compared
   to 24 bird and 108 tree species in forests. However, the structure of
   the assemblages was significantly different between ecosystems, with an
   average dissimilarity of 33.8 percent and 87.9 percent for birds and
   trees, respectively. Shade plantations had consistently less endemic
   species than the forest; we estimated a drop from 17 to 13 in birds and
   from 17 to 3 in trees. We also found that despite marked differences in
   the response of bird species to the vegetation characteristics of shade
   plantations, there was a strong positive link between aboveground tree
   biomass and endemic species richness and abundance. These results show
   that shade plantations hold assemblages impoverished in endemic species,
   but that management can improve their value for the conservation of
   these species. Finally, we suggest that biodiversity-friendly
   certification and carbon markets are used to implement and guarantee the
   long-term economical sustainability of practices that favor the endemic
   species in SAo Tome's shade plantations.

AB Taxonomic distinction is a measure of diversity that has a number of
   advantages that provides relevant connotation to theoretical and applied
   ecology. The usefulness of this type of measure as an alternative method
   for assessing the biodiversity of soft-bottom benthic marine ecosystems
   was tested using the indices of average taxonomic distinctness (Delta+)
   and variation in taxonomic distinctness (Lambda+) for mollusk
   communities of the Gulf of Batabano (Cuba). For this purpose,
   inventories of soft bottom benthic mollusk species obtained in the
   period 1981-1985 and the years 2004/2007 were used. Both species lists
   were analyzed and compared at spatial and temporal scales. The taxonomic
   composition, between the period 1981-1985 and years 2004 and 2007,
   consisted of 3 classes, 20 orders, 60 families, 137 genera and 182
   species observed. With the exception of the class level, a
   non-significant decrease of this composition in 2004 and 2007 was
   detected. At a spatial scale, a significant decrease in the taxonomic
   richness was observed in 2004. Significant differences were not detected
   in Delta+ and Lambda+ to time scale, but at spatial scale, results
   revealed significant differences that could be attributed to the
   combined effect of increased anthropogenic activities in the region with
   hurricane induced effects. These results suggest that the pair of
   indices, Delta+ and Lambda+, are good descriptors of the biodiversity of
   soft-bottom benthic mollusk communities in the Gulf of Batabane.

   and Child Health program at the Public Health/Community Health Center in
   Koror, Palau. Twenty-four hour diet recalls were collected from both
   groups, 17 anthropometric and body composition measurements were made on
   the women and a range of body measurements from height to a full battery
   of 28 measures were obtained from the children. Diets were found to be
   low in energy, calcium and zinc. Women consume micronutrients primarily
   from fish, traditional starches, vegetables and fruits, while children
   rely more on fortified grain products and milk. The energy distribution
   is higher in protein and fat and lower in carbohydrate than earlier
   reports of adult Palauans. A significant minority of the women (27%)
   have body fat or body mass index profiles indicative of clinically
   significant obesity or energy storage deficit, both problematic in terms
   of pregnancy outcomes. While sample sizes of infant and young child
   cohorts are very small, our findings indicate that a relatively high
   proportion of these younger children, have experienced inadequate growth
   and development This is especially true of females, among whom stunting
   (height deficients) and especially wasting (weight and arm circumference
   deficits) were in greater evidence.

AB This study examines factors affecting the rate and extent of biomass
   build-up among commercially important groupers, snappers, grunts,
   parrotfish and surgeonfish in a network of four marine reserves in
   southwest St. Lucia, Caribbean. Reserves constituted 35% of the total
   reef area originally available for fishing. Protection was instigated in
   1995 after a baseline survey with annual or biennial censuses performed
   until 2002. Each survey consisted of 114 fifteen minute fish counts in
   reserves and 83 in fishing grounds, at depths of 5 In and 15 In in a 10
   In diameter counting area. Estimates of number and size (cm) of target
   species were used to calculate fish family biomass. Data were analysed
   using three-way ANOVA in a before - after- control-impact pairs (BACIP)
   design. All families increased significantly in biomass over time at
   nearly all sites. Increases were greater in reserves than fishing
   grounds, except for grunts, and responses were strongest in parrotfish
   and surgeonfish. The combined biomass of families more than quadrupled
   in reserves and tripled in fishing grounds between 1995 and 2002. During
   this period coral cover declined by 46% in reserves and 35% in fishing
   grounds. Multiple regression showed that neither habitat characteristics
   nor habitat deterioration significantly affected rates of biomass
   build-up. The key factor was protection from fishing, which explained
   44% of the variance in biomass growth. A further 28% of the variance was
   explained by sedimentation, a process known to stress reef
   invertebrates, significantly reducing the rate of biomass build-up. St.
   Lucia's reserves succeeded in producing significant gains to fish stocks
   despite coral cover and structural complexity falling steeply over the
   period of the study. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Hermit crabs (Decapoda: Anomura) are typically omnivorous and are common
   on Caribbean coral reefs. Sponges are sessile, fleshy, and high in
   protein and energy content, yet hermit crabs do not appear to prey on
   them. Assays were performed with the Caribbean reef hermit crab
   Paguristes punticeps to determine whether secondary metabolites or
   skeletal elements of Caribbean sponges that were incorporated into
   artificial foods affected feeding. Of 30 sponge species assayed, 26
   (87%) yielded organic extracts that deterred feeding by P. punticeps.
   There was substantial interspecific and intraspecific variability in
   patterns of chemical deterrence. Sponges of the families Axinellidae,
   Agelasidae, Aplysinidae, Aplysinellidae, and Thorectidae typically
   yielded deterrent extracts. Three common sponge species, Mycale laevis,
   Callyspongia vaginalis, and Niphates erecta, were consistently
   non-deterrent, while other species, including Spheciospongia othella,
   Chondrilla nucula, Callyspongia plicifera, Niphates digitalis, and
   Xestospongia muta, were variably deterrent. These results are in general
   agreement with those of a previous survey of Caribbean sponge chemical
   defenses using the common reef fish Thalassoma bifasciatum. However,
   some results differed: Geodia neptuni and Iotrochota birotulata were
   consistently palatable to T. bifasciatum, but were deterrent to P.
   punticeps. Several species that were consistently deterrent to T.
   bifasciatum were variably deterrent to P, punticeps, including Aplysina
   cauliformis, Aplysina fulva, Ircinia strobilina, Amphimedon compressa,
   and Mycale laxissima. Neither spicules (from Agelas clathrodes,
   Ectyoplasia ferox, and Xestospongia muta) nor spiculated spongin
   skeleton (from A. clathrodes and X. mute) deterred feeding by P.
   punticeps. Spicules and spiculated spongin were similarly non-deterrent
   to the fish T. bifasciatum in a previous survey. The results of this
   study further suggest that chemical defenses are important in the
   ecology of Caribbean sponges, while skeletal components do not serve an
   antipredatory function.

AB A sampling survey was carried out to study the distribution and ecology
   of leptocephali in several different areas of the western South Pacific
   between 160 and 175 degrees E during August and September of 1995. The
   survey included transects of stations across the westward flowing South
   Equatorial Current (SEC) region to the northwest of Fiji and south to 30
   degrees S, a transect to the north of the Tasman Front, and a transect
   that passed through the Solomon Islands. A total of 2362 leptocephali of
   at least 94 species of 13 families of eels and other elopomorph fishes
   were collected. The most abundant leptocephali in the region were of the
   marine eel families Serrivomeridae, Congridae, Nemichthyidae, and
   Muraenidae of the order Anguilliformes. The leptocephali of shallow
   water eels of the Chlopsidae, Moringuidae, Muraenidae, and Ophichthidae
   were most abundant and present at a wide size range in the low salinity
   "Fresh Pool", which is also located closest to the major islands in the
   SEC region. Anguillid leptocephali were also most abundant in the SEC
   region and several species appeared to be spawning at that latitude.
   Cluster analysis and ordination of the catch rates of leptocephali
   suggested there were four regional assemblages related to the offshore
   spawning of mesopelagic serrivomerid eels, the presence of anguillid
   leptocephali in the SEC region and the relationship between the regional
   ocean current patterns and the geography of islands where shallow water
   marine eels live and probably spawn nearby. More impoverished
   assemblages were found in the southern regions where there are fewer
   islands, colder, higher salinity surface waters, and predominantly
   eastward flow. These findings support the hypothesis that various taxa
   of anguillid and marine eels use different spawning and recruitment
   strategies in the western South Pacific region as has been suggested by
   studies on leptocephali in the Northern Hemisphere. (c) 2006 Elsevier

AB Major coral bleaching events have occurred throughout the tropics during
   the last 25 yrs. Although many reefs in the Caribbean bleached
   repeatedly throughout the 1980s and early 1990s, the reefs of Belize did
   not suffer a widespread bleaching event until the summer of 1995. At the
   time of mass bleaching water temperature and solar radiation were
   elevated and wind speeds were low. In October-November 1995, 52% of
   corals surveyed were affected by bleaching, compared to only 7% in May
   1996. No spatial trends were found, although some tars had significantly
   different levels of bleaching at different depths. A positive
   correlation was found between the relative abundance and the percent
   affected of different taxa, indicating that bleaching may act to
   increase diversity if mortality occurs. There was a significant
   difference in the extent of bleaching between corals reported to host
   different clades of zooxanthellae. By May 1996, 25% of the originally
   bleached, tagged specimens experienced at least partial tissue
   mortality. It is estimated that approximately 10% of all coral colonies
   experienced some partial tissue mortality by May 1996 as a result of
   this bleaching event. Such bleaching-induced partial tissue mortality
   may decrease the structural integrity of the reef framework and decrease
   the ecological competitiveness of corals and other symbiotic reef
   organisms.

   main branches of Barbados cherry trees Malpighia glabra in the
   municipalities of Pacajus and Paraipaba in Ceara state. The larvae
   girdle the main and lateral branches causing blockage of the phloem
   resulting in drying of the branches and the entire plant. Mortality can
   affect 100% of young plants. This is the first record of this pest
   attacking Barbados cherry in Brazil. The continuous presence of this
   insect in plantations has resulted in the systematic use of chemical
   control to reduce populations. The adults are dark metallic blue with a
   very rough surface. In the last larval stage the adults build a
   heart-shaped cocoon made of its own excrement to complete the cycle.

AB Extralimital traits-evolutionary innovations that represent
   unprecedented departures from the phenotypic norm in the clade in which
   they arise-are often thought preferentially to evolve in island-like
   settings, but accumulating evidence indicates that they also arise in
   highly diverse, competitively rigorous ecosystems. In order to evaluate
   the origins of extralimital traits, I reconstructed the history of all
   ecological and shell-morphological innovations in Miocene to Recent
   shallow-water molluscs from the two great modern tropical marine realms,
   the Indo-West Pacific (IWP) and Atlantic-eastern Pacific (AEP), with the
   expectation that the more diverse IWP would show a higher incidence of
   innovation. Of the 66 innovations I identified, 53 (80%) are IWP and 13
   (20%) are AEP in origin. Data on the numbers of living species in 26
   molluscan clades in the two tropical realms indicate that the species
   ratio (AEP to total number of species 0.32 +/- A 0.115) exceeds the
   innovation ratio (AEP to total innovations 0.21). The per-species
   frequency of innovation is therefore significantly higher in the IWP.
   None of the innovations is unique to endemic taxa on oceanic islands. I
   suggest that warm, large, highly productive environments are more
   conducive to the establishment of new ecological roles and phenotypic
   states than are smaller, less productive, more island-like settings; and
   that diversity need not be correlated with either high productivity or
   evolutionary opportunity for innovation.

   reduced by 80%, from about 50% to 10% cover, in three decades. Our
   meta-analysis shows that patterns of change in coral cover are variable

   that local causes have operated with some degree of synchrony on a
   region-wide scale. Although the rate of coral loss has slowed in the
   past decade compared to the 1980s, significant declines are persisting.
   The ability of Caribbean coral reefs to cope with future local and

AB An experimental deployment of pressure sensors was undertaken to assess
   the impact of reef flat excavation pits on wave processes at Majuro
   Atoll, Marshall Islands. Experiments were undertaken on two sections of
   an 80-m-wide fringing reef flat, one modified by the excavation of a
   17-m wide, 4- to 5-m deep pit and the other an unmodified reef flat of
   comparable width, topography, and incident wave energy. A wave-driven
   inundation event during the experiment led to minor amounts of debris
   overwashing the road surface. The event was associated with southerly
   swell that was normally incident to the study site at high tide,
   resulting in enhanced shoreline energy in both the sea and swell and the
   infragravity frequency bands. The shoreline with the excavation pit
   received slightly smaller wave heights (similar to 8%) for all wave
   conditions, including the overwash event, compared to the unmodified
   shoreline. The statistically significant difference is largely a result
   of a decrease in infragravity wave energy over and shoreward of the pit
   that compensates for a weak increase in sea and swell energy. The
   influence on infragravity energy levels is likely to depend on the pit
   geometry and position, as well as the wave forcing; hence, not all pits
   are likely to lead to net wave energy dissipation. Implications of the
   findings are discussed with respect to the impacts of reef flat
   excavation on a highly developed, urbanised atoll.

AB A detailed understanding of the dual role of parrotfish as both key
   herbivores and potentially important corallivores is essential to the
   study of coral health and reef trophodynamics. Some Caribbean parrotfish
   regularly consume live coral, and discriminate both among coral species
   and among colonies within a particular species. While they prefer
   Montastraea spp. corals, which are dominant Caribbean reef builders,
   causes of selective and persistent grazing of certain colonies remain
   unknown. We manipulated coral exposure to parrotfish grazing through a
   long-term cage exclusion experiment in Belize, comparing initially
   grazed vs. intact (non-grazed) Montctstraea spp. colonies. We measured
   nutrition-related characteristics (C:N ratio, %C, and %N) as well as
   defensive characteristics (nematocyst density and skeletal hardness) to
   determine if any of these variables accurately predicted parrotfish
   grazing. There were substantial reductions in coral nutritional quality
   (C:N) associated with parrotfish grazing, although these changes appear
   to be a consequence rather than a cause of parrotfish selectivity.
   Likewise, nematocyst densities were suppressed in grazed corals, also
   likely a result of chronic grazing stress. We found no intraspecific
   differences in skeletal hardness related to grazing. These results
   provide further demonstration of the physiological consequences of
   grazing, but the cause of preferential grazing by parrotfishes on
   certain Montastraea spp. colonies still requires further investigation.

AB In many settlements across the world (e.g. Pimpama Coomera and Mawson
   Lakes - Australia, Hong Kong - China, Majuro - Marshall Islands, Tarawa
   - Kiribati, and Windhoek - Namibia), dual water reticulation systems
   have been implemented in response to increasing water demands and
   decreasing freshwater availability. A dual water reticulation system
   comprises separate pipes that supply different water qualities to the
   end consumer. A set of pipes supply potable water while another set of
   pipes supply non-potable water. The non-potable water is targeted at
   meeting water requirements traditionally met using potable water ( e. g.
   toilet and urinal flushing, landscaping irrigation, and industrial
   cooling). This therefore frees potable water to be used for previously
   unmet or increasing potable water requirements. For several reasons
   including the dearth of relevant national regulatory and guideline
   documents, consumer and decision-maker perceptions, ignorance, and
   appropriate decision-making tools, the use of dual water reticulation
   systems in South Africa has been limited. The aim of this study was
   therefore to develop a decision-making framework, using robust criteria,
   for assessing the viability of implementing dual systems in South
   Africa. This aim was achieved through undertaking literature reviews on
   the subject, an investigation of non-potable water consumers' and
   decision-makers' perceptions using questionnaires, and the actual
   development of a framework using data obtained from the literature
   review and questionnaires. The questionnaires were developed using seven
   key issues i.e. public health and safety, economics, technical
   feasibility, legislation/regulations and guidelines, organisational
   capacity, social acceptance, and public education. The various aspects
   of the Triple Bottom Line of sustainability (i.e. economic,
   environmental and social) provided structure to the framework while the
   Triple Bottom Line approach was utilised in the assessment of the
   different criteria.

AB New time series of Nd and Pb isotopes were generated from two
   hydrogenous ferromanganese crusts from the eastern Indian Ocean, which
   were dated by Be-10/Be-9 profiles and Co chronometry. The goal was to
   gain information on the nature and timing of variations of the deep
   water radiogenic isotope composition as a function of the evolution of
   the Indonesian Island Arcs since the Early Miocene, changes in ocean
   circulation related to the different stages of the closing of the
   Indonesian seaway for deep and intermediate water mass exchange since
   the Mid-Miocene, and enhanced Himalayan weathering since the Late
   Oligocene.
   A crust from 4119 m water depth in the Wharton Basin adjacent to Sumatra
   and the Java Trench (DODO 232D) has recorded a small variability in Nd
   isotope, but pronounced variations in Pb isotope composition over the
   past 17 Myr. Patterns and absolute values of the Nd and Pb isotope time
   series closely resemble the record of previously published crust SS663
   from the central Indian Ocean, located some 2500 km SW of crust DODO
   232D in the northern central Indian Ocean. In accordance with the
   interpretation derived from crust SS663, the Pb isotope composition of
   deep water in the Wharton Basin has apparently been mainly controlled by
   products of Himalayan erosion and weathering and to a lesser extent by
   the evolution of the Indonesian Island Arcs.
   The location of a second crust(VA16 13KD-1) from 2 100 m water depth on
   the Scott Plateau off NW Australia is beneath the present day outflow of
   Pacific-derived surface and thermocline water masses into the eastern
   Indian Ocean. The pattern of the Pb present day outflow of Pacific
   isotope time series of this crust and the observed changes in Pb isotope
   mixing relationships, which occurred at similar to 11.5 and similar to
   3.5 Ma, reflect the combined influence of advection and mixing of water
   masses through the Indonesian Seaway and weathering of volcanic source
   rocks within the emerging Indonesian Island Arcs over the past 33 Myr.
   The Nd isotope time series shows a pattern similar to central and
   southwest Pacific crusts and is best explained by a mixture between Nd
   from water masses advected from the Indian and Southern Ocean and Nd
   released by weathering from the emerging Indonesian Island Arcs. (c)

AB Forged and still scarred by slavery, Caribbean agricultural landscapes
   are now being made redundant in an era of global market integration. The
   demise of preferential trade agreements is exposing the
   uncompetitiveness of the plantation sector while small farmers, still
   largely confined to marginal positions within highly inequitable
   landscapes, are being pushed into a new vulnerability by market
   integration, as rising food imports flood local markets. Unfortunately,
   political attention continues to revolve around the ailing plantation
   sector. In contrast, it is argued here that the current crisis of
   Caribbean agriculture contains a historic opportunity for restructuring
   in the interests of the region's small farmers and that, in the process,
   the sector could be helped to gain a new vitality.

AB Background
   Ciguatera is a circumtropical disease produced by polyether sodium
   channel toxins (ciguatoxins) that enter the marine food chain and
   accumulate in otherwise edible fish. Ciguatoxins, as well as potent
   water-soluble polyethers known as maitotoxins, are produced by certain
   dinoflagellate species in the genus Gambierdiscus and Fukuyoa spp. in
   the Pacific but little is known of the potential of related Caribbean
   species to produce these toxins.
   Methods
   We established a simplified procedure for extracting polyether toxins
   from Gambierdiscus and Fukuyoa spp. based on the ciguatoxin rapid
   extraction method (CREM). Fractionated extracts from identified Pacific
   and Caribbean isolates were analysed using a functional bioassay that
   recorded intracellular calcium changes (Ca2+) in response to sample
   addition in SH-SY5Y cells. Maitotoxin directly elevated Ca-i(2+), while
   low levels of ciguatoxin-like toxins were detected using veratridine to
   enhance responses.
   Results
   We identified significant maitotoxin production in 11 of 12 isolates
   analysed, with 6 of 12 producing at least two forms of maitotoxin. In
   contrast, only 2 Caribbean isolates produced detectable levels of
   ciguatoxin-like activity despite a detection limit of >30 pM.
   Significant strain-dependent differences in the levels and types of
   ciguatoxins and maitotoxins produced by the same Gambierdiscus spp. were
   also identified.
   Conclusions
   The ability to rapidly identify polyether toxins produced by
   Gambierdiscus spp. in culture has the potential to distinguish
   ciguatoxin-producing species prior to large-scale culture and in
   naturally occurring blooms of Gambierdiscus and Fukuyoa spp. Our results
   have implications for the evaluation of ciguatera risk associated with
   Gambierdiscus and related species.

AB Forests are often frontiers, and like all frontiers, they are sites of
   dynamic social, ecological, political and economic changes. Such
   dynamism involves constantly changing advantages and disadvantages to
   different groups of people, which not surprisingly can lead to armed
   conflict, and all too frequently to war. Many governments have
   contributed to conflict, however inadvertently, by nationalizing their
   forests, so that traditional forest inhabitants have been
   disenfranchised while national governments sell the rights to trees in
   order to earn foreign exchange. Biodiversity-rich tropical forests in
   Papua New Guinea, Indonesia, Indochina, Myanmar, Sri Lanka, Central and
   West Africa, the Amazon, Colombia, Central America and New Caledonia
   have all been the sites of armed conflict in recent years, sometimes
   involving international forces. Forests have sometimes been part of the
   cause of conflict (as in Myanmar and Sierra Leone) but more often
   victims of it. Violent conflicts in temperate areas also typically
   involve forests as shelters for both civilians and combatants, as in the
   Balkans. While these conflicts have frequently, even invariably, caused
   negative impacts on biodiversity, peace can be even worse, as it enables
   forest exploitation to operate with impunity. Because many of the
   remaining forests are along international borders, international
   cooperation is required for their conservation. As one response, the
   concept of international "Peace Parks" is being promoted in many parts
   of the world as a way of linking biodiversity conservation with national
   security. The Convention on Biological Diversity, which entered into
   force at the end of 1993 and now has 187 State Parties, offers a useful
   framework for such cooperation.

   is the only species of the genus described from the western Atlantic.
   Because its original description does not provide much information about

   the northeastern coast of Brazil, and compare it with C. tanna. The
   holotype of C. twine was located and examined. Cerberilla potiguara new
   species is longer than C. twine but has relatively shorter oral
   tentacles and a narrower foot; the radular teeth of Cerberilla potiguara
   new species have prominent central and marginal cusps, which are absent
   in C. tanna. A prominent unarmed penis associated with a conical atrium,
   observed in Cerberilla potiguara new species and other Cerberilla
   species, is herein considered a distinguishing characteristic of the

   lens thickness, total volume of fresh groundwater, and safe yield are
   estimated for the 52 most populous islands of the Maldives for current
   conditions and for the year 2030, with the latter accounting for
   projected SLR and associated shoreline recession. An algebraic model,
   designed in previous studies to estimate the lens thickness of atoll
   islands, is expanded in this study to also estimate volume of
   groundwater. Results indicate that average current lens thickness,
   groundwater volume, and per capita safe yield are approximately 4.6m,
   1,300million liters, and 300l/day, and that these values will decrease
   by approximately 10, 11, and 34%, respectively, by the year 2030. Based
   on results, it is demonstrated that groundwater, in terms of quantity,
   is a viable source of water for the islands of the Maldives both now and
   in coming decades, particularly for islands with large surface area and
   low population. Study results can provide water resource managers and
   government officials with valuable data for consideration in water
   security measures.

AB This paper presents a simple model for tsunami sedimentation that can be
   applied to calculate tsunami flow speed from the thickness and grain
   size of a tsunami deposit (the inverse problem). For sandy tsunami
   deposits where grain size and thickness vary gradually in the direction
   of transport, tsunami sediment transport is modeled as a steady,
   spatially uniform process. The amount of sediment in suspension is
   assumed to be in equilibrium with the steady portion of the long period,
   slowing varying uprush portion of the tsunami. Spatial flow deceleration
   is assumed to be small and not to contribute significantly to the
   tsunami deposit. Tsunami deposits are formed from sediment settling from
   the water column when flow speeds on land go to zero everywhere at the
   time of maximum tsunami inundation. There is little erosion of the
   deposit by return flow because it is a slow flow and is concentrated in
   topographic lows. Variations in grain size of the deposit are found to
   have more effect on calculated tsunami flow speed than deposit
   thickness. The model is tested using field data collected at Arop, Papua
   New Guinea soon after the 1998 tsunami. Speed estimates of 14 m/s at 200
   m inland from the shoreline compare favorably with those from a I-D
   inundation model and from application of Bernoulli's principle to water
   levels on buildings left standing after the tsunami. As evidence that
   the model is applicable to some sandy tsunami deposits, the model
   reproduces the observed normal grading and vertical variation in sorting
   and skewness of a deposit formed by the 1998 tsunami. Published by

AB Recent theory suggests that the geographic location of island radiations
   (local accumulation of species diversity due to cladogenesis) can be
   predicted based on island area and isolation. Crickets are a suitable
   group for testing these predictions, as they show both the ability to
   reach some of the most isolated islands in the world, and to speciate at
   small spatial scales. Despite substantial song variation between closely
   related species in many island cricket lineages worldwide, to date this
   characteristic has not received attention in the western Indian Ocean
   islands; existing species descriptions are based on morphology alone.
   Here we use a combination of acoustics and DNA sequencing to survey
   these islands for Ornebius crickets. We uncover a small but previously
   unknown radiation in the Mascarenes, constituting a three-fold increase
   in the Ornebius species diversity of this archipelago (from two to six
   species). A further new species is detected in the Comoros. Although
   double archipelago colonisation is the best explanation for species
   diversity in the Seychelles, in situ cladogenesis is the best
   explanation for the six species in the Mascarenes and two species of the
   Comoros. Whether the radiation of Mascarene Ornebius results from
   intra-or purely inter-island speciation cannot be determined on the
   basis of the phylogenetic data alone. However, the existence of genetic,
   song and ecological divergence at the intra-island scale is suggestive
   of an intra-island speciation scenario in which ecological and mating
   traits diverge hand-in-hand. Our results suggest that the geographic
   location of Ornebius radiations is partially but not fully explained by
   island area and isolation. A notable anomaly is Madagascar, where our
   surveys are consistent with existing accounts in finding no Ornebius
   species present. Possible explanations are discussed, invoking
   ecological differences between species and differences in environmental
   history between islands.

   been reinterpreted or 'radicalised' in the post-Cold War period.
   Duffield's contention that development now incorporates more
   transformative measures to address the concern among Northern states for
   conflict resolution is presented as a manifestation of the
   security-development nexus. The following argues that although
   Duffield's analysis cannot be applied to Solomon Islands without
   qualification, his claims provide insights into the disjuncture between
   Australian governmental declarations, policy and policy outcomes in

AB The tidal channels of mangrove islands such as Twin Cays, Belize support
   a productive and diverse microplankton assemblage. In turn, this
   microplankton community supports large populations of copepods that form
   dense aggregations in the prop-root environment along the margins of
   these channels. The growth rate of the phytoplankton community and the
   grazing rate of the heterotrophic microzooplankton community were
   measured using the seawater dilution method. In separate experiments,
   the grazing rate of the swarm-forming copepod Dioithona oculata on
   natural microplankton assemblages was measured. Chlorophyll
   concentrations in the natural plankton assemblages used in these
   experiments ranged from 1-to-11 [mu]g Chl a L-1. Dinoflagellate
   populations typically ranged from 17-to-50 cells ml-1, with
   heterotrophic dinoflagellates generally exceeding autotrophic forms in
   abundance. Ciliates were the second most abundant form of heterotrophic
   microzooplankton with populations ranging from 1-15 cells ml-1. Results
   of the dilution experiments indicate that, during the study period,
   microzooplankton grazed between ca. 60-90% of potential phytoplankton
   production and phytoplankton growth exceeded microzooplankton grazing in
   all experiments. Grazing studies with D. oculata indicated that copepod
   ingestion rates were highest on ciliates and autotrophic dinoflagellates
   and that copepod populations are capable of grazing about 10% of the
   protozoan population each day.

   livelihoods, transport, agricultural traction, agricultural
   diversification and sustainable agricultural production. The aim of this

   and livestock species play in rural communities of Timor-Leste,
   highlighting the importance of animal production for the wellbeing and
   rural development, and relate the functions performed by livestock
   production with economic, social and cultural attributes of the
   communities. The data used in this study were collected in 2011 through
   a questionnaire survey in three rural communities in the district of
   Bobonaro, namely in a mountain area, an irrigation plain and a coastal
   zone, and were complemented with secondary data. Livestock production in
   Timor-Leste is predominantly familiar being chickens, pigs, goats,
   cattle, horses, buffaloes and sheep the main species. Beyond the
   economic function, each livestock species also performs social and
   cultural functions.

AB Bananas (Musa spp.), including dessert and cooking types, are of major
   importance in the tropics. Due to extremely high levels of sterility,
   the diversity of cultivated bananas is fixed over long periods of time
   to the existing genotypes. This pattern puts banana-based agrosystems at
   risk. Therefore, assessing the extent of wild and cultivated banana
   diversity, conserving it and making it available for further use is a
   priority. We report here the collection of new wild and cultivated
   banana germplasm in the Autonomous Region of Bougainville, Papua New
   Guinea. In total, 61 accessions were collected and their names and uses
   were recorded when possible. Classification was also provided based on
   the observations made in the field. Three wild specimens were collected.
   Among the 58 cultivated accessions, we noted that eight were used as
   ornamental plants, seven were edible varieties of the Fe'i type and two
   were natural tetraploids from the Musa section. The ploidy was then
   checked by flow cytometry and the accessions were genotyped with a set
   of 19 SSR markers. The genotyping results were merged to the dataset
   from Christelova et al. (Biodivers Conserv 26:801-824, 2017). This joint
   analysis helped refine or confirm the classification of the collected
   accessions. It also allowed to identify 10 private alleles and 35
   genotypes or Genotype Groups that were not present in the wider dataset.
   Finally, it shed light on the diversification processes at work in the
   region, such as the capture of mutations by farmers and the likely
   occurrence of geneflow within the cultivated genepool.

AB Tropical cyclones (also known as hurricanes or typhoons) generate
   extreme floods in parts of the tropics and subtropics between about 10
   degrees and 30 degrees of latitude. Accounts of the resulting high shear
   stress and unit stream power, enhanced stream competence, sediment
   transport and storage, and channel forms are now available for a limited
   number of streams in Australia, South Asia, and the Caribbean. Not only
   are these very large floods but they also tend to occur at an interval
   of decades, rather than as 50 year or 100 year floods. This paper
   discusses the hydrology of these extreme floods, areas of their
   occurrence, their effect on channel size and form. and the flushing of
   sediment downchannel. The recovery of the channel from its response to
   such floods is indirectly dependent on: (a) the size difference between
   the hurricane floods and floods that occur at smaller intervals such as
   1-2 years, and (b) the texture of the sediment in the channel. Streams
   draining basins where tracks of tropical cyclones cross tectonically
   active terrains tend to be strongly controlled by extreme events.

   Primno brevidens, and P. latreillei), are new records in the Caribbean

   (39.68% of total hyperiid numbers), Tetrathyrus forcipatus (14%),
   Eupronoe intermedia (7.14%), and Brachyscelus crusculum (3.56%). These
   are among the most common forms in the western Caribbean. The overall
   mean abundance of hyperiids (240 org./1000 m(3)) is low when compared
   with other western Atlantic areas like the Gulf of Mexico, but it is
   similar to values obtained in the oligotrophic waters of the western
   Caribbean. A Bray-Curtis similarity index analysis revealed three groups
   of stations that suggest a strong influence of the fully oceanic
   hyperiids even in areas relatively close to the coastline. This is
   attributed to the local current pattern and to the narrowness of the
   continental shelf along the Mexican Caribbean coast.

AB The wild mungbean, Vigna radiata ssp. sublobata, is an 'old world'
   tropical species indigenous throughout the better watered areas of
   northern Australia. Variation among 115 accessions, mainly from
   Australia, West Timor, and Papua New Guinea, was evaluated for several
   diverse traits. The plants were cultivated in the field at 2 sowing
   dates, at both a tropical and a subtropical location, with 6 accessions
   from India and a mungbean cultivar for comparison. Substantial variation
   was identified for traits of potential agronomic, adaptive, or taxonomic
   interest. For some traits, like phenology, the variation appeared to be
   systematic, with plausible underlying physiological and/or adaptive
   explanation. Among accessions, wild type traits, like prostrate habit,
   more gracile morphology, twining form, and small hard seeds, tended to
   be associated. There was a general geographic trend for lines collected
   from locations more remote from where mungbean has historically been
   cultivated to show greater expression of wild type traits, with few
   'traits of domestication' evident in the Australian accessions. Some of
   the identified variation, e. g. higher seed protein content,
   hardseededness, and putative disease resistance, may be of value in
   mungbean variety improvement. A more targetted evaluation of the
   collection would likely reveal other adaptations, especially tolerance
   to environmental stresses. As such, the wild accessions are a
   potentially valuable if under-utilised germplasm resource.

   analyses highlight the Philippines, New Guinea, Sulawesi, the Caribbean,
   China temperate forests and the Atlantic Forest of south-eastern Brazil
   as the most important (for their high number of genera) 'threat-spots'
   for rodent conservation. A few regions, mainly drylands, are singled out
   as important areas for rodent conservation but are not generally
   recognized in global biodiversity assessments. These are the remaining
   forests of Togo, extreme 'western Sahel', the Turanian ansi
   Mongolian-Manchurian steppes and the desert of the Horn of Africa.
   Resources for conservation must be allocated first to recognized threat
   spots and to those restricted-range genera which may depend on
   species-specific strategies for their survival.

AB Thirty-two young domestic water buffalo were studied to evaluate ear-tag
   retention during an epidemiologic field trial. Plastic ear-tags were
   placed in both ears before the start of the trial, which was implemented
   in an extensively managed domestic water buffalo herd of approximately
   1000 animals in Trinidad front 1999-2001. The presence or absence of
   ear-tags was recorded at the times of animal handling. The rate of
   car-tag loss was modeled using a parametric survival analysis assuming
   an exponential rate of loss. A gamma distribution was used to estimate
   the amount of time that each animal Would be positively identified based
   only on the presence or absence of one or more ear-tags. The overall
   median ear-tag retention was 272 days. The estimated rate of ear-tag
   loss was 0.0024 car-tags lost per day. The use of car-tags alone might
   not be sufficient for long-term identification of extensively managed
   animal populations. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The paper presents trends in economic growth and development in nine
   Asian least developed countries ( Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Bhutan,
   Cambodia, Lao PDR, Myanmar, Nepal, Timor-Leste, and Yemen) over the
   period from 2001 to 2015. The study is mainly based on the data
   retrieved from the World Bank Open Data. During analysed 15 years,
   Asia's LDCs, except Yemen, experienced high economic growth. Average
   annual GDP per capita growth rate in five countries was more than 4%.
   GDP has been largely generated through the service and industry sectors.
   The biggest decline in the contribution of agriculture sector to GDP was
   observed in the fastest growing economies. Afghanistan, Timor-Leste, and
   Bhutan sustained strong growth mainly because of foreign assistance. In
   Nepal, Yemen, and Bangladesh remittances were a significant source of
   development finance. In the years 2001-2015, Myanmar, Cambodia, Lao PDR,
   and Bhutan increased their GDP per capita more than twice. Asia's LDCs
   substantially improved their development indicators. Cambodia,
   Afghanistan, and Timor-Leste recorded the highest rise in the value of
   HDI. Moreover, Cambodia, Timor-Leste, and Yemen significantly reduced
   infant mortality and under-five mortality. Afghanistan, Timor-Leste, and
   Lao PDR made big progress in reduction of maternal mortality. Life
   expectancy at birth increased the most in Cambodia, Bhutan, and
   Timor-Leste. A lot of people in Asia's LDCs have gained access to
   electricity and improved water and sanitation. However, Asian least
   developed countries are slowly implementing economic reforms. What's
   more, Asia's LDCs, except Bhutan, have big problems with corruption and
   poor governance.

   colonies always had a single queen. It was suggested that the arboreal
   ant fauna in the mangrove forest canopy revealed an ant mosaic
   distribution pattern. As the main food resource, the Philidris ants
   obtained honeydew secreted by the diaspidid scale insects on the shoot
   tips of the host mangrove trees of H. moseleyanum.

AB Reefal units in the early to middle Miocene of Anguilla consist of
   small, irregular lenses of variable coral composition which developed on
   a shallow, isolated offshore carbonate platform. They are composed of
   three distinct coral biofacies (branched, mound-shaped, and platy),
   which are haphazardly distributed in association with inter-reef sands.
   These units most probably formed as patch reefs across a broad, shallow
   area that was exposed to moderate energy conditions and periodically
   affected by storms. No evidence supports the existence of a more
   extensive barrier reef system. Comparisons with Oligocene and
   Mio-Pliocene reefs suggest that during the early to middle Miocene,
   Caribbean reefs were generally smaller in size (< 100 m(3)) and lower in
   diversity (21 species in Anguilla, 42 species in total across the
   Caribbean) than Caribbean reefs during the late Oligocene or during the
   late Miocene to early Pliocene (71 species in the Dominican Republic, 80
   species total across the Caribbean). The early to middle Miocene
   Caribbean reef coral fauna was dominated by nine widespread species that
   occur in deposits of similar age in both Anguilla and Panama. More than
   half of the fauna consisted of Oligocene relicts. Of the 21 genera that
   first appeared in the Caribbean during Miocene time, 14 had first
   occurrences after the middle Miocene, as barrier reef systems became
   more prevalent across the central Caribbean.

   Tornaria morgani, the larva of Ptychodera bahamensis, is transported in

   bahamensis are known of the Cape Verde Islands, but benthic populations,
   common in the Caribbean Sea, are unknown in the eastern Atlantic.
   Whereas the East Pacific apparently acts as a barrier to the dispersal

AB This paper reviews some of the issues relating to typhoid fever in Papua
   New Guinea. Before the mid-1980s only sporadic cases of typhoid were
   reported but it is now one of the greatest public health problems in the
   highlands and some urban areas. In one study near Goroka an annual
   incidence rate of 1208 per 100,000 people was found, with settlers from
   other areas at greater risk than the local landowners. Problems relating
   to management included differentiation from other diseases, the
   limitations of the Widal test and poor compliance among outpatients. In
   Papua New Guinea it appears that transmission is largely from person to
   person, with little evidence for water-borne transmission. The prolonged
   convalescent excretion of Salmonella typhi and the difficulties this
   poses for control of the disease are discussed. Prevention will only be
   achieved in the long term by improvements in hygiene and sanitation,
   though more immediate control could be achieved by vaccination with an
   appropriate vaccine.
AB Few cases of typhoid fever were reported in Papua New Guinea (PNG)
   before 1960 and only sporadic cases were reported during the 1960s. 
   However, typhoid fever has now become a major public health problem in
   the country, endemic throughout the Highlands Region and in some of the
   larger coastal towns such as Port Moresby.  In 1993 and 1994, there were
   4485 and 4551 people, respectively, reported to have been admitted with
   typhoid fever throughout PNG, with 87% and 73% of these cases,
   respectively, occurring in the Highlands Region.  The vast majority of
   the remainder of patients were in the National Capital District,
   Central, or Morobe Provinces.  No data are available on the number of
   outpatient cases.  The transmission of typhoid fever in PNG appears to
   be mainly from person to person, with little evidence of water-borne
   transmission.  Problems posed by the prolonged convalescent excretion of
   Salmonella typhi are discussed.  Typhoid fever will be prevented over
   the long term by improvements in hygiene and sanitation, although more
   immediate control could be achieved through vaccination with an
   appropriate vaccine.

AB In intracellular symbiosis, the host is both the symbiotic partner and
   the habitat for the symbiont. Physical conditions may vary within a host
   individual, leading to niche partitioning within a host according to
   symbiont genotype. In this study, the algal symbionts (zooxanthellae)
   inhabiting the octocoral Plexaura kuna (Lasker, Kim, Coffroth) were
   characterized. Zooxan-thellae are currently divided into clades based on
   sequence variation of the small and large subunit ribosomal gene and
   internal transcribed spacer regions. Zooxanthellae isolated from the top
   and bottom of a P. kuna colony, from colonies sampled at various depths
   and geographic locations (Bahamas, Florida Keys, Panama and St. Croix,
   USVI), from 1988 to 1998, all belonged to clade B. Since symbiont
   variability within a host is an individual-level question, in the second
   part of the study, multilocus DNA fingerprinting was used. Each
   genetically distinct P. kuna colony (i.e. non-clonemate) hosted a unique
   prominent zooxanthella genotype. This zooxanthella genotype was found at
   both the top and the bottom of the host colony, although physical
   conditions differed between these areas. The existence of one prominent
   zooxanthella genotype throughout a colony may indicate a fixed
   symbiont-acquisition period or the active maintenance of a hostsymbiont
   genotypic association.

AB Variation in gut length of closely related animals is known to generally
   be a good predictor of dietary habits. We examined gut length in 28
   species of butterflyfishes (Chaetodontidae), which encompass a wide
   range of dietary types (planktivores, omnivores, and corallivores). We
   found general dietary patterns to be a good predictor of relative gut
   length, although we found high variation among groups and covariance
   with body size. The longest gut lengths are found in species that
   exclusively feed on the living tissue of corals, while the shortest gut
   length is found in a planktivorous species. Although we tried to control
   for phylogeny, corallivory has arisen multiple times in this family,
   confounding our analyses. The butterflyfishes, a speciose family with a
   wide range of dietary habits, may nonetheless provide an ideal system
   for future work studying gut physiology associated with specialization
   and foraging behaviors.

   for at least four generations on E. crassipes, P. cordata, and M.
   vaginalis. Two-way choice and multiple choice preference trials were
   conducted and discussed. E. catarinensis did not exhibit a clear
   preference for waterhyacinth over other Pontederiaceae in these trials.
   Most oviposition occurred into the upper surface of the lamina during
   laboratory testing despite observations that the underside was preferred
   in the held. Although not considered suitable for release in Australia,
   this insect may be useful in other countries where more serious
   waterhyacinth problems occur and where M. vaginalis is a serious weed,

AB Effectiveness of a marine protected area (MPA) in supporting fisheries
   productivity depends upon replenishment patterns, both in supplying
   recruits to surrounding fished areas and having a sustainable spawning
   stock in the MPA. Surveys for queen conch Strombus gigas were made in
   2011 at 2 locations in the Exuma Cays, The Bahamas, for direct
   comparison with surveys conducted during the early 1990s at Warderick
   Wells (WW) near the center of the Exuma Cays Land and Sea Park (ECLSP)
   and at a fished site near Lee Stocking Island (LSI). There was no change
   in adult conch density and abundance in the shallow bank environment at
   LSI where numbers were already low in 1991, but numbers declined 91% in
   the deeper shelf waters. At WW, the adult population declined 69% on the
   bank and 6% on the island shelf. Unlike observations made in the 1990s,
   queen conch reproductive behavior near LSI is now rare. Average age of
   adult conch (indicated by shell thickness) at LSI decreased
   significantly during the 20 yr period between surveys, while average age
   increased at WW and juvenile abundance decreased. These results show
   that the LSI population is being overfished and the WW population is
   senescing because of low recruitment. In 2011, the ECLSP continued to be
   an important source of larvae for downstream populations because of
   abundant spawners in the shelf environment. However, it is clear that
   the reserve is not self-sustaining for queen conch, and sustainable
   fishing in the Exuma Cays will depend upon a network of MPAs along with
   other management measures to reduce fishing mortality.

AB Total mercury (THg), methylmercury (MeHg) and stable isotopes of
   nitrogen (delta N-15) and carbon (delta C-13) were measured in three
   invertebrate, five fish, three seabird and three marine mammal species
   of central West Greenland to investigate trophic transfer of mercury in
   this Arctic marine food web. The food web magnification factor (FWMF)
   estimated as the slope of the regression between the natural logarithm
   of THg or MeHg concentrations (mg kg(-1) dw) and tissue delta N-15
   (parts per thousand) was estimated to 0.183 (SE = 0.052) for THg and
   0.339 (SE = 0.075) for MeHg. The FWMFs were not only comparable with
   those reported for other Arctic marine food webs but also with quite
   different food webs such as freshwater lakes in the sub-Arctic, East
   Africa and Papua New Guinea. This suggests similar mechanisms of mercury
   assimilation and isotopic (delta N-15) discrimination among a broad
   range of aquatic taxa and underlines the possibility of broad ecosystem
   comparisons using the combined contaminant and stable isotope approach.

   and/or Barbados included the bivalve "Bathymodiolus" childressi, the

   from sedimented slopes in the Bahamas and the wood-dwelling sipunculan
   Phascolosoma turnerae, found in Barbados, the Bahamas, and the Gulf of
   Mexico. Durations of the planktonic larval stages ranged from 3 weeks in
   lecithotrophic tubeworms to more than 2 years in planktotrophic
   starfish. Planktotrophic sipunculan larvae from the northern Gulf of
   Mexico were capable of reaching the mid-Atlantic off Newfoundland, a
   distance of more than 3000 km, during a 7- to 14-month drifting period,
   but the proportion retained in the Gulf of Mexico varied significantly
   among years. Larvae drifting in the upper water column often had longer
   median dispersal distances than larvae drifting for the same amount of
   time below the permanent thermocline, although the shapes of the
   distance-frequency curves varied with depth only in the species with the
   longest larval trajectories. Even species drifting for >2 years did not
   cross the ocean in the North Atlantic Drift.

AB Harrovia longipes is the most common crinoid-associated crab found in
   Hansa Bay (Madang Province, Papua New Guinea). It lives mainly on
   comasteriids but also on mariametrids and himerometrids. It occurs
   generally as either single individuals or heterospecific couples on the
   host. Y-tube experiments showed that H. longipes individuals were
   strongly chemo-attracted by their crinoid hosts, much less by non-host
   crinoids and not by other echinoderms. The attractant was dialysable
   with membranes of a 3,500 molecular weight cut off but not when the cut
   off was of 500, suggesting that its weight lies between 500 and 3,500D.
   The attractive power of crinoid-conditioned seawater decreased when
   diluted. It remained unchanged when water was filtered at 0.2 [mu]m,
   refrigerated at 4[degree]C or 0[degree]C, or heated to 50[degree]C but
   was lost when water was heated to 70[degree]C.

AB The New Guinea alpine-subalpine zone is the highest, largest, and
   wettest such region on any tropical island and it preserves great
   variations in biodiversity between the individual mountain areas.
   Relatively few plant species are confined to the alpine zone and this
   may reflect a limited time for adaptation by herbaceous species arriving
   in the formerly extensive alpine-subalpine biome. In the Pleistocene a
   zone above 3400 m was affected by glaciation while open subalpine
   habitat was greatly expanded by cooler climates and low levels of CO2
   which hindered the formation of subalpine forest. With post-glacial
   warming, the subalpine contracted and open areas were invaded by
   shrublands and forest. Early to late Holocene opening out of the
   subalpine forest and shrublands is associated with fire that was a
   result of hunting by humans. This process starts early in some areas but
   is late or absent on more remote areas.
   The alpine is threatened by increased warming and potential invasion by
   emergent shrubs but is likely to prove resilient to extinction provided
   that wet conditions continue to prevail. Changing cultural use of high
   altitudes suggests that the subalpine shrublands are recovering in some
   areas. However, some mammals and bird species seem to have been lost or
   become restricted on mountains that are accessible from population
   centers at lower altitude. With few exceptions, management consists of
   benign neglect although widespread fires in 1997-1998 point to
   continuing human impacts linked to drought events. The large mine on
   Mount Jaya influences subalpine usage over a large area. Tourism is very
   minor and unlikely to expand while political problems affect both Papua
   New Guinea and Papua province and logistics remain a severe difficulty.
   However, locally managed tourism on Mount Wilhelm provides a good model
   for future development.

   Trenches situated at its southeastern margin are moving together with
   the Philippine-Sea plate. Resistance of viscous asthenosphere against

   pressure is generated in the frontal zone of the vertical slab, while
   tectonic erosion in the trench bottom proceeds both under the influence

   There is no assurance that such an effort would be successful, however,
   despite good intentions, co-operation in many areas at present and some

AB Macroboring organisms are recognised as key agents of reef framework
   modification and destruction, and while recent studies in the Pacific
   have improved understanding of spatial variations in macroboring
   community structure, and rates of macroboring within individual reefs,
   comparable studies from the Caribbean are largely lacking. This study
   assesses the distribution of macroboring species and the degree of
   framework infestation across the reefs at Discovery Bay, north Jamaica.
   Although individual species of borers exhibit variable distributions
   across the reef, relative abundances of the main groups of macroborers
   (sponges, bivalves, worms) illustrate clear distributional trends.
   Sponges are dominant at fore-reef sites, while sipunculan and polychaete
   worms are only of importance at back-reef/lagoon and shallow fore-reef
   sites. Bivalves are locally important within back-reef and lagoon patch
   reef framework. Average percentages of internal bioerosion (macroboring)
   vary between sites, but are highest at back-reef and deep fore-reef
   sites. No systematic pattern of variation occurs within back-reef/lagoon
   samples, but a significant trend of increased macroboring is recognised
   with increased water depth on the fore-reef. In addition, significant
   differences in terms of the susceptibility of individual coral species
   are recognised. These factors are likely to result in biasing of the
   fossil record, with variable styles of preservation evident both between
   sites (i.e. with depth/environment) and within sites (i.e, between coral
   species).

AB Size-related diet shifts are important characteristics of fish
   trophodynamics. Here, body size-related changes in muscle delta N-15 and
   delta C-13 of four coral reef fishes, Acanthurus nigrofuscus
   (herbivore), Chaetodon lunulatus (corallivore), Chromis xanthura
   (planktivore) and Plectropomus leopardus (piscivore) were investigated
   at two locations in the Solomon Islands. All four species occupied
   distinct isotopic niches and the concurrent delta C-13' values of C.
   xanthura and P. leopardus suggested a common planktonic production
   source. Size-related shifts in delta N-15, and thus trophic level, were
   observed in C. xanthura, C. lunulatus and P. leopardus, and these trends
   varied between location, indicating spatial differences in trophic
   ecology. A literature review of tropical fishes revealed that positive
   delta N-15-size trends are common while negative delta N-15-size trends
   are rare. Size-delta N-15 trends fall into approximately equal groups
   representing size-based feeding within a food chain, and that associated
   with a basal resource shift and occurs in conjunction with changes in
   production source, indicated by delta C-13. The review also revealed
   large scale differences in isotope-size trends and this, combined with
   small scale location differences noted earlier, highlights a high degree
   of plasticity in the reef fishes studied. This suggests that trophic
   size analysis of reef fishes would provide a productive avenue to
   identify species potentially vulnerable to reef impacts as a result of
   constrained trophic behaviour.

AB Secondary production is a composite measure of an animal population's
   density, biomass, and growth over time. Thus, secondary production
   converts animal abundance and biomass data into a functional measure of
   energy flow through an ecosystem. In the present study, we used
   community secondary production as a composite measure of ecosystem
   functional response to anthropogenic disturbance, and applied this
   approach to examine effects of fragmentation on tidal creek ecosystems
   in The Bahamas. Community fish production decreased from a mean of 901 g
   m(-2) yr(-1) in unfragmented creeks to 166 g m(-2) yr(-1) in downstream
   areas of fragmented creeks to 29 g m(-2) yr(-1) upstream of creek
   blockages in fragmented creeks. When compared with several univariate
   measures (species richness, evenness, abundance, biomass), community
   composition (by ordination), and community distribution (via rank-curve
   analysis), community secondary production appeared to be the most
   consistent variable for distinguishing between three creek fragmentation
   categories. These data suggest that small, non-significant declines in
   diversity or other structural metrics can yield disproportionately large
   declines in ecosystem function. We suggest community secondary
   production can be an important component of future assessments of
   anthropogenic impacts, especially when alterations in diversity or
   community structure are small, but potentially have dramatic impacts on
   ecosystem function.

AB A field study of coral bleaching and coral communities was undertaken
   spanning 8 countries and similar to 35 degrees of latitude in 2005. This
   was combined with studies in southern Kenya and northeast Madagascar in
   1998 and Mauritius in 2004 to develop a synoptic analysis of coral
   community structure, bleaching response, susceptibility of the
   communities to bleaching, and the relative risk of extinctions in
   western Indian Ocean coral reefs. Cluster analysis identified 8 distinct
   coral communities among the 91 sites sampled, with 2 distinct
   communities in northern South Africa and central Mozambique, a third in
   the central atolls of the Maldives, and 5 less differentiated groups, in
   a swath from southern Kenya to Mauritius, including Tanzania, the
   granitic islands of the Seychelles, northeast Madagascar, and Reunion.
   Massive Porites, Pavona, and Pociflopora dominated the central and
   northern Indian Ocean sites and, from historical records, replaced
   dominance by Acropora and Montipora. From southern Kenya to Mauritius,
   coral communities were less disturbed, with Acropora and Montipora
   dominating, and a mix of subdominants including branching Porites,
   Fungia, Galaxea, massive Porites, Pocillopora, and Synarea. The survey
   identified an area from southernmost Kenya to Tanzania as having the
   least disturbed and highest diversity reefs, and as being a regional
   priority for management. Taxa vulnerable to future extinction based on
   their response to warm water, population density, and commonness include
   largely low-diversity genera with narrow environmental ranges, such as
   Gyrosmilia interrupta, Plesiastrea versipora, PlerogyTa sinuosai and
   Physogyra lichtensteini.

AB Aims. To investigate a potential link between consumption of food
   privately imported from the Pacific Islands and presentation with acute
   gastroenteritis to Middlemore Hospital Emergency Department.
   Methods. This was a three month prospective observational case study
   that included patients aged greater than fifteen years presenting with
   acute gastroenteritis and a history of food privately imported from the
   Pacific Islands. Data included case demographics, symptoms, island of
   food origin and food type. Stool and blood samples were collected and
   analysed.
   Results. Of 358 patients who presented to Middlemore Emergency
   Department during the study period with gastroenteritis, 34 (9.4%) had a
   history of consumption of food privately imported from the Pacific
   Islands. The seafood came from Tonga (23 cases), Samoa (10 cases) or
   Niue (I case). The implicated seafood was shellfish (28 cases),
   jellyfish (2 cases), fish intestine (2 cases), seaweed or seaslug (1
   case each). Fourteen patients (41%) provided stool samples; all were
   culture positive for Vibrio parahaemolyticus (VPH).
   Conclusions. This case series confirms a link between acute VPH
   gastroenteritis and consumption of seafood privately imported from the
   Pacific Islands. A number of public health initiatives to reduce the
   burden of VPH gastroenteritis among Auckland's Pacific Islanders have
   commenced. The Ministries of Health, Agriculture and Forestry are
   considering tighter controls or banning food privately imported from the
   Pacific Islands.

AB Twenty-five sweetpotato cultivars from Papua New Guinea (PNG) and
   Australia were studied for their flour digestibility properties. The
   cultivars displayed monophasic digestograms, and a modified first-order
   kinetic model adequately predicted the rate and extent of starch
   digestion. Flours from all the cultivars had high average glycemic index
   (Gl(avg)) and glycemic load (GL). This study of starch digestion in a
   wide range of sweetpotato cultivars demonstrates associations and
   interactions of non-starch components in the flours, and their effects
   on starch digestibility. The presence of resistant starch (RS) in some
   cultivars is highlighted with respect to its potential contribution to
   human health and nutrition. Crown Copyright (C) 2011 Published by

AB Floriculture has been proposed as an ideal basis for sustainable
   enterprise development for resource-poor communities in the Pacific
   Islands, Papua New Guinea and northern Australia. World trade in
   floricultural products continues to increase in some countries and there
   are recognised market opportunities for floriculture based on the rich
   plant biodiversity of the Pacific and Australian region. The Australian
   Centre for International Research (ACIAR) has funded two reviews to
   highlight specific floricultural opportunities and identify constraints
   and opportunities in the use of native floriculture to improve the
   livelihoods of Indigenous communities in Australia, Papua New Guinea and
   the Pacific Islands. This paper will present the findings of these
   reviews in the monsoonal tropics of the Northern Territory. This
   objective was achieved through interviews with a variety of stakeholder
   groups involved in floriculture, a desk top analysis of the factors
   influencing indigenous participation and a case study investigating the
   value chains of cycad fronds. Our initial results indicate that low
   population density, low consumer demand and competition from imports all
   limit local and regional market demand for floricultural products.
   Remoteness and consequent high transport costs also adversely impacts
   market competitiveness. Indigenous participation in this industry is
   further compromised by a complex array of cultural, logistical and
   social factors that not only limit their involvement in conventional
   floriculture, but also influence the economic feasibility of wild
   harvested products. Despite these obstacles, some growers of exotic
   tropical species in northern Australia have managed to compete in
   southern Australian markets. This paper will outline the factors that
   influence participation and growth in the floriculture industry in the
   Northern Territory and will suggest research and development
   opportunities to improve the growth of this industry.

AB The Pu239+240 activities and Pu-240/Pu-239 atom ratios in sediments of
   the northern South China Sea and its adjacent Pearl River Estuary were
   determined to examine the spatial and temporal variations of Pu inputs.
   We clarified that Pu in the study area is sourced from a combination of
   global fallout and close-in fallout from the Pacific Proving Grounds in
   the Marshall Islands where above-ground nuclear weapons testing was
   carried out during the period of 1952-1958. The latter source dominated
   the Pu input in the 1950s, as evidenced by elevated Pu-240 /Pu-239 atom
   ratios (>0.30) in a dated sediment core. Even after the 1950s, the
   Pacific Proving Grounds was still a dominant Pu source due to continuous
   transport of remobilized Pu from the Marshall Islands, about 4500 km
   away, along the North Equatorial Current followed by the transport of
   the Kuroshio current and its extension into the South China Sea through
   the Luzon Strait. Using a simple two end-member mixing model, we have
   quantified the contributions of Pu from the Pacific Proving Grounds to
   the northern South China Sea shelf and the Pearl River Estuary are 68%
   +/- 1% and 30% +/- 5%, respectively. This study also confirmed that
   there were no clear signals of Pu from the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear
   Power Plant accident impacting the South China Sea.

AB The gulper sharks (genus Centrophorus) are a group of deep-water
   benthopelagic sharks with a worldwide distribution. The alpha taxonomy
   of the group has historically been problematic and the number of species
   included in the genus has varied considerably over the years and is
   still under debate. Gulper sharks are routinely caught in mid- and
   deep-water fisheries worldwide and some have shown a considerable
   decline in abundance in the last few decades. Clear and consistent
   species discrimination of Centrophorus is essential for an efficient and
   sustainable management of these fisheries resources. Our study used
   molecular cytochrome oxidase subunit I (COI) and 16S ribosomal RNA gene
   sequences and morphometric data to re-evaluate the diversity of
   Centrophorus in North Atlantic waters, including the Gulf of Mexico, the
   Caribbean, and the Mediterranean Seas. Molecular data separated North
   Atlantic Centrophorus into five well-supported groups whereas
   morphometric data separated these same five groups and suggested three
   additional groups for which no molecular data were available. Four of
   the five groups identified in the North Atlantic also occur in the
   Indian and/or Pacific Oceans, thus extending the reported range of some
   species considerably. A species identification key for North Atlantic
   Centrophorus is provided based on our findings. (c) 2014 The Linnean
