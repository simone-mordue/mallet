AB Although the effects of climate change are universal, Small Island
   Developing States (SIDS) are considered to be most vulnerable. SIDS
   heavily rely on imported oil and fossil fuels for electricity generation
   and transportation, which makes them economically vulnerable and exposed
   to fluctuating oil price. Among the reasons SIDS highly depend on diesel
   fuel is due to the dispersed population living in remote islands which
   means, providing electricity through on on-grid system is difficult.
   Fiji as one of the SIDS, has actively promoted renewable sourced energy
   through a national plan to mitigate the impacts of climate change. In
   order to determine how feasible implementing a renewable energy (RE)
   system will be in Fiji, this study chose a remote island called Mavuva
   Island to test application of a hybrid RE system using HOMER. A
   combination of energy storage system (ESS), solar photovoltaic (PV) and
   diesel generator turns out to be the most cost effective and optimal
   configuration, resulting in effective greenhouse gas reduction for the
   given region.

AB Freshwater lenses on small islands are vulnerable to many climate
   change-related stressors, which can act over relatively long time
   periods, on the order of decades (e.g., sea level rise, changes in
   recharge), or short time periods, such as days (storm surge overwash).
   This study evaluates the response of the freshwater lens on a small
   lowlying island to various stressors. To account for the varying
   temporal and spatial scales of the stressors, two different
   density-dependent flow and solute transport codes are used: SEAWAT
   (saturated) and HydroGeoSphere (unsaturated/saturated). The study site
   is Andros Island in the Bahamas, which is characteristic of other
   low-lying carbonate islands in the Caribbean and Pacific regions. In
   addition to projected sea level rise and reduced recharge under future
   climate change, Andros Island experienced a storm surge overwash event
   during Hurricane Francis in 2004, which contaminated the main wellfield.
   Simulations of reduced recharge result in a greater loss of freshwater
   lens volume (up to 19 %), while sea level rise contributes a lower
   volume loss (up to 5 %) due to the flux-controlled conceptualization of
   Andros Island, which limits the impact of sea level rise. Reduced
   recharge and sea level rise were simulated as incremental instantaneous
   shifts. The lens responds relatively quickly to these stressors, within
   0.5 to 3 years, with response time increasing as the magnitude of the
   stressor increases. Simulations of the storm surge overwash indicate
   that the freshwater lens recovers over time; however, prompt remedial
   action can restore the lens to potable concentrations up to 1 month
   sooner.

   is 2.9%; the infant mortality rate in 1985 was 64/1000.  The islands
   have adequate hospital facilities for common ailments.  The overriding
   domestic concern is economic development, particularly in the
   agricultural sector.  Because domestic food-crop production is
   inadequate to meet local consumption needs, the country imports much of
   its food.

   Analysis of seismic profiles and Seabeam bathymetric data, permit the

   N95-degrees-E which induced morphostructural elements, characteristic of
   this type of kinematics in a thick sedimentary cover, separated from its

   This decollement level is due to the presence of Miocene clay beds,
   supersaturated with water which under the effect of stresses, trigger

AB T. atrochalybeia is the only representative of the Monarchinae
   (Muscicapidae) occurring on Sao Tome Island (Gulf of Guinea, west
   Africa). Until 1971 it was fairly abundant (.apprx. 1 pair/km2) in
   various types of forest and plantations. Since then the population has
   declined, probably due to the extensive use of insecticides on
   cultivated land. Smaller numbers inhabit forest-edges and groves in the
   savanna on the leeward northern part of the island. It forages at
   heights of < 1 m-6 or 8 m in the understorey of forests, woods and
   plantations. In habits it resembles other members of the genus which
   occur on the African mainland. The cup-shaped nest is apparently
   identical in construction to those of other species in the genus: fibers
   and very thin, paperlike pieces of bark with an external covering of
   moss, lichens and cobwebs, and a lining of thinner fibers. There are
   usually 2 eggs in the clutch, sometimes 1 and very occasionally 3.
   Breeding occurs from mid-July-mid-Feb. with a peak of activity during
   Nov. and Dec. The fact that breeding is not year-round is at variance
   with many of the mainland species; although a remarkable habit it is not
   confined to Sao Tome and Princes' Islands. The closest affinities of
   this entirely black flycatcher appear to be neither with T. tricolor (of
   Fernando Po) or T. smithii (of Annobon Island) which have no crests and
   only a short and rather stiff tail. The Sao Tome bird with medium-sized
   crest and longish tail appears to be more closely related to T. viridis
   in spite of a lack of any rufous color in the plumage. It may be an old
   off-shoot from a black, or black and white, population of the
   polymorphic T. viridis group which has evolved further in isolation on
   Sao Tome.

AB The Smallholder Market Access and Food Supply Project (SMAFSP) is one of
   the Public Investment Projects under the Papua New Guinea Government's
   Medium Term Development Programme which is being implemented by the
   Department of Agriculture and Livestock and various Provincial
   Governments. SMAFSP seeks to develop the identified 31
   nutritionally-disadvantaged and least developed areas of Papua New
   Guinea. The broad goal of the project is to improve the standard of
   rural living and to provide diversified employment opportunities for
   smallholder families. The major objectives are: to improve subsistence
   food production and consumption; to increase cash cropping and market
   access; to strengthen rural extension and adaptive research services;
   and to increase opportunities for earning cash incomes.
   The implementation of the original SMAFSP Phase 1 which started in 1988
   encountered several problems in its early years due partly to its poor
   formulation and design, and the lack of economic analysis. The
   Government decided in 1990, after a mid-term review, that the project
   should be completely revised through a new planning exercise to ensure
   that major development objectives for the project areas are fully
   achieved. The revised appraisal was conducted in 1991 and it involved
   the development of an economic simulation model using the Lotus 1-2-3
   spreadsheet package, the most readily available simple appraisal package
   in Papua New Guinea. The economic simulation model developed is useful
   for the continuous appraisal and monitoring of the different phases of
   SMAFSP based on actual annual allocation of Government budget funds and
   the degree of achievement of production targets.

AB The South Pacific is a biodiverse region of extreme evolutionary
   importance because it harbors ancient lineages and recent radiations.
   However, few population-level studies of genetic variation have been
   conducted in the land masses of this region. Likewise, the number of
   population-level studies using myriapods as models is extremely small.
   In this article, we compare the genetic structure of two species of
   centipedes in the genus Cryptops endemic to the South Pacific, one from
   a continental island, the other from oceanic islands. The level of
   genetic diversity and structure in C. pictus, a species endemic to New
   Caledonia, is much higher than in C. niuensis in Fiji and Vanuatu,
   despite the fact that C. niuensis is spread across two different
   archipelagos and several islands. The most likely explanation is the
   relatively young age of the remnants of the Vitiaz Arc (Fiji and
   Vanuatu) compared to New Caledonia. Using the emergence of Fiji-Vanuatu
   as a calibration point, C. pictus is estimated to have diverged by 23.4
   Mya (upper 95% confidence interval) with a mean estimate of 11.7 Mya
   versus the 9.7 Mya of C. niuensis. Considering the absence of shared
   sequences between specimens from different sampling sites and the high
   genetic structuring within populations, C. pictus appears to be an ideal
   candidate to assess historical processes at a micro-evolutionary scale
   in New Caledonia.

AB Very little empirical work has been done to assess the potential impacts
   of climate change upon terrestrial biodiversity within small islands,
   many of which contribute to global species diversity due to high levels
   of endemicity. This study illustrates projections of not only individual
   but also the 'collective' response of a group of high conservation value
   tree species to climate change within the Caribbean small island of
   Trinidad. The species distribution modelling algorithm MaxEnt was used
   to construct models of the realised present environmental space occupied
   by these species based on present day climate and other environmental
   factors. These models were then used to estimate present and future
   (2050; SRES A2) distributions of these species across Trinidad. Both
   present and future model output were incorporated to create change maps
   which illustrate projected expansions, contractions and areas of stable
   environmental space for each species. Individual change maps were
   combined to create a 'collective' change map portraying projected
   changes in the environmental space of this species group as a whole.
   Most individual species and the collective group response were projected
   to lose more than 50% of present environmental space, with the latter
   being limited to the southern edge of the island. Our results suggest
   that small islands may experience an eventual disappearance of endemics
   and other valuable species under SRES A2 conditions, which may serve to
   further depreciate global terrestrial species diversity. Application of
   this 'collective' response may be particularly useful for planning
   within the limited geographic spaces available for conservation within
   small islands. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Metals can have significant impacts on inhabitants of mangrove swamps as
   well as consumers of mangrove-associated fauna. Yet, for several
   Caribbean islands, assessments regarding the impact of metals on such
   ecosystems are particularly sparse. The present study investigated the
   distribution and potential impact of Cd, Cr, Cu, Ni, Pb and Zn in the
   Caroni Swamp, Trinidad and Tobago's largest mangrove ecosystem. Surface
   sediments and mangrove oysters (Crassostrea rhizophorae) from 10 sites
   in the swamp were analysed for the 6 identified metals. The
   concentration ranges (in mu g/g dry wt.) of metals in sediments from
   Caroni Swamp were: Zn (113.4-264.6), Cr (27-69.7), Ni (10.7-41.1) and Cu
   (11-40.7). Based on Canadian Sediment Quality Guidelines (CSQGs), metals
   in sediments posed a low to medium risk to aquatic life. The
   concentration ranges (in mu g/g wet wt.) for metals in Crassostrea
   rhizophorae tissues were: Zn (123.2-660), Cu (4.2-12.3), Ni (0.1-5.5),
   Pb (0.1-0.9), Cr (0.2-0.3) and Cd (0.1-0.2). Multiple evaluations
   indicated that zinc posed a potential threat to the health of oyster
   consumers. Information from this study is vital for managing the Caroni
   Swamp, safeguarding the health of consumers of shellfish on this
   Caribbean island and serving as a useful baseline for future local and
   regional risk assessments.

AB Thirty-year rainfall records for seven coastal locations in Papua New
   Guinea were analysed to assess the spatial and temporal characteristics
   of rainfall anomalies and the general response of coastal rainfall to
   the Southern Oscillation (SO). Spatial and temporal variability of
   rainfall anomalies are a distinct feature of the coastal locations
   analysed. Despite the spatial variability of rainfall anomaly behaviour,
   an all Papua New Guinea rainfall anomaly index shows significant
   concurrent and lag inverse associations with the Southern Oscillation
   Index of Wright. Anomalously high (low) pressure in the Papua New Guinea
   region leads to low (high) rainfall in the concurrent and ensuing
   season. Rainfall anomaly periodicities of 7-8 years lie within the
   time-scale of 2-10 years for ENSO events, but individual locations
   demonstrate a variable response to ENSO events. Study results fill an
   important geographical gap in the understanding of the spatial and

AB One of the major goals of invasion biology is predicting the effects of
   invaders on native species, which is often accomplished by linearly
   scaling-up per-capita effects with invader abundance. However, the
   relationship between invader density and their ecological impact is
   poorly understood, and it is likely that the effects of invasive species
   scale non-linearly with increasing invader density. The Pacific red
   lionfish (Pterois volitans) is an invasive predator that has reached
   high abundances throughout the tropical and sub-tropical western
   Atlantic, Caribbean, and Gulf of Mexico. A single lionfish can have
   extremely large effects on native reef-fish communities, yet the
   relationship between lionfish density and their ecological effects is
   not well known. I manipulated juvenile lionfish densities on small patch
   reefs in the Bahamas and monitored the subsequent effects on native
   coral-reef fish abundance, biomass, richness, evenness, composite
   diversity, and community structure over 7 weeks. Native fish abundance
   and biomass decreased non-linearly with increasing lionfish density,
   with the largest drops in abundance and biomass at low lionfish
   densities and their effects leveling off at high densities. Lionfish
   density also significantly affected richness and community structure,
   but these effects could not be clearly classified as either linear or
   non-linear. Evenness and composite diversity were not significantly
   affected by lionfish density. Given that the effects of lionfish on
   native fish abundance and biomass level-off at high lionfish densities,
   it appears important to remove all lionfish from small patch reefs to
   have the biggest influence on conserving the native community.

   Indonesia, Papua New Guinea, and the Solomon Islands. Although it has
   been proposed that the rapid decline of Pacific leatherback turtles is
   due to increased adult mortality, little is known about the health of
   this population. Health assessments in leatherbacks have examined
   females on nesting beaches, which provides valuable biological
   information, but might have limited applicability to the population as a
   whole. During September 2005 and 2007, we conducted physical
   examinations on 19 foraging Pacific leatherback turtles and measured
   normal physiologic parameters, baseline hematologic and plasma
   biochemistry values, and exposure to heavy metals (cadmium, lead, and
   mercury), organochlorine contaminants, and domoic acid. We compared
   hematologic values of foraging Pacific leatherbacks with their nesting
   counterparts in Papua New Guinea (n=11) and with other nesting
   populations in the Eastern Pacific in Costa Rica (n=8) and in the
   Atlantic in St. Croix (n=12). This study provides the most comprehensive
   assessment to date of the health status of leatherbacks in the Pacific.
   We found significant differences in blood values between foraging and
   nesting leatherbacks, which suggests that health assessment studies
   conducted only on nesting females might not accurately represent the
   whole population. The establishment of baseline physiologic data and
   blood values for healthy foraging leatherback turtles, including males,
   provides valuable data for long-term health monitoring and comparative
   studies of this endangered population.

AB Shipboard acoustic Doppler current profiler observations of the velocity
   in the upper 200 m of the water column collected during 1984-1996 using
   the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration RN Malcolm Baldrige
   are used to examine the velocity structure and transport in the passages
   between the Atlantic Ocean and the Intra-Americas Sea (IAS). Data were
   collected during 23 cruises along the following sections: across the
   Straits of Florida, in the Northwest Providence Channel (NWPC), across
   the northern passages into the Caribbean Sea (Windward, Mona, and
   Anegada), across the eastern Caribbean along 63 degrees 30' W, thereby
   forming a closed quadrangle, and in the Grenada Passage. The Florida
   Current, the eastern Caribbean, and the Grenada Passage share a similar
   mean velocity structure characterized by high-velocity,
   surface-intensified flows with strong vertical and horizontal shears.
   The northern Caribbean passages (NWPC, Windward, Mona, and Anegada)
   share a different common mean velocity structure, with subsurface
   velocity maxima directed into the IAS, and surface-intensified
   counterflows along one side of each passage. On average, there is a
   transport balance in the upper 200 m between waters entering and exiting
   the IAS, with the 16.5 +/- 2.4 Sv (1 Sv = 10(6) m(3)/s) transport of the
   Florida Current at 27 degrees N comprised of 0.4 +/- 0.8 Sv from the
   NWPC, 2.2 +/- 1.5 Sv from the Windward Passage, 2.8 +/- 2.1 and 2.4 +/-
   2.8 Sv from the Mona and Anegada passages, respectively, and 9.5 +/- 4.7
   Sv across the eastern Caribbean, for a total of 17.3 Sv. The four
   passages north of 17 degrees N (from NWPC to Anegada Passage) have a
   combined transport of 7.8 Sv, nearly half of the transport of the
   Florida Current in the upper 200 m. Of the 9.5 Sv flowing through the
   eastern Caribbean between 11 degrees N and 17 degrees N, 4.9 +/- 2.6 Sv,
   or more than half, come from the Grenada Passage. This is significant to
   the subject of cross-equatorial exchange of mass, heat, and salt, as the
   Grenada Passage is where the highest transport of waters originating in
   the southern hemisphere is thought to enter the Caribbean.

AB Background: Epidemiological studies indicate there is low incidence of
   colon cancer in the South Pacific islands, including Fiji, West Samoa,
   and Vanuatu. Cancer incidence has been shown to be inversely associated
   with kava (Piper methysticum G. Forst.) ingestion.
   Hypothesis/Purpose: Kava prepared traditionally will inhibit the growth
   of human cancer cells. This investigation entails preparation and
   analysis of kava extracts and study of the growth inhibitory activity of
   the extracts, alone and combined with hibiscus.
   Study Design: We will prepare kava as in Micronesia - as a water
   extract, high in particulate content, alone or combined with sea
   hibiscus (Hibiscus tiliaceus L.) - and examine the components and growth
   inhibitory activity.
   Methods: We obtained ground kava prepared in the traditional way from
   lateral roots and sea hibiscus mucilage and sap from different sources
   in Micronesia, and prepared water extracts (unfiltered, as well as
   filtered, since in traditional use the kava beverage contains a high
   particulate content) and partitions. We used the MTT assay to determine
   the growth inhibitory activity of the preparations on colon and breast
   cancer cells and nonmalignant intestinal epithelial cells. LC-MS
   analysis was used to examine the components of the kava and sea hibiscus
   extracts and partitions.
   Results: Traditional preparations of kava inhibit the growth of breast
   and colon cancer cells. Among the kava preparations, the order of
   decreasing activity was Fiji(2), Fiji(1), Hawaii; the unfiltered
   preparations from Fiji were more active than the filtered. Phytochemical
   analysis indicated that filtering reduced most kavalactone and chalcone
   content. For example, for Fiji(2), the ratio of dihydromethysticin in
   filtered/ unfiltered kava was 0.01. Thus, for the extracts from Fiji,
   growth inhibitory activity correlates with the content of these
   compounds. Unfiltered and filtered kava from Fiji(1) were more active on
   malignant than nonmalignant intestinal epithelial cells. Since kava is
   prepared in Micronesia by squeezing the extract through sea hibiscus
   bark, we assayed the growth inhibitory activity of combinations of kava
   and sea hibiscus sap and found that sea hibiscus enhanced the growth
   inhibitory effect of kava.
   Conclusion: Our results show that traditional kava, alone or combined
   with sea hibiscus, displays activity against human cancer cells and
   indicate it will be worthwhile to develop and further analyze these
   preparations to prevent and treat colon and other cancers. Our findings
   suggest it is important to examine the activity of plants in the form
   that people consume them. (C) 2016 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.

AB Small Island Developing States like the Caribbean islands face a
   challenge in securing watersheds and freshwater to service competing
   water demands from various economic sectors. Processes of prioritisation
   for access to water often lack equity, represent the interests of
   industrial demands, and marginalize interests and water needs of the
   poor. Regional Poverty Reduction Strategy Papers are based on
   traditional economic indicators and give scant attention to the poverty
   and forest resource nexus and therefore inadequately reflect the actual
   and potential role of forest resources in alleviating rural poverty.
   Poverty related issues were once perceived as solely the domain of
   government ministries responsible for social affairs. However, there has
   been a shift and many sectors, including the forests and watershed
   management sector, now strive to incorporate poverty reduction elements
   in policy formulation. The challenge remains one of coordinating
   strategies under various portfolios for poverty reduction while ensuring
   access to water and forest resources by the poor.

AB Aim Regional patterns of forest composition in West Polynesia were
   analysed to determine the relative importance of dispersal limitation,
   speciation, environmental filtering and biotic interactions. Location
   West Polynesia (Fiji, Tonga, Samoa). Methods We applied clustering and
   indicator species analysis to presence/absence data for 397 tree taxa in
   338 forest plots to detect groups of plots sharing similar species
   composition. Patterns of plot composition and co-occurrence of
   congeneric species were compared between archipelagos for evidence of
   dispersal limitation, speciation, and environmental filtering versus
   competitive displacement or niche differentiation across the three
   archipelagos at the local (plot) and regional scales. Results Dispersal
   limitation was evident in the compositional segregation of inland rain
   forests across the three archipelagos, whereas compositional overlap was
   widespread for coastal forests, which are composed of species dispersed
   by water. Within genera, species numbers attenuated from Fiji to Tonga
   to Samoa, but speciation also contributed to compositional differences
   in all three island groups. Environmental filtering was suggested by the
   distinct composition of both secondary and mature inland rain forest
   versus coastal forest. At the local scale, however, clumping of
   congeners, which might suggest fine-scale environmental filtering, was
   observed for only a minority of inland forest genera. Most genera showed
   either overdispersion, suggesting competitive displacement or niche
   differentiation, or patterns not significantly different from random.
   Main conclusions Well-established biogeographical patterns of dispersal
   limitation and speciation contribute to West Polynesian tree diversity
   at the community scale. Environmental filtering and competitive
   displacement further structure forest communities; the evidence from
   this study suggests that environmental filtering is more important at a
   landscape scale, while competitive displacement may be more important at
   a local scale, although their relative importance varies considerably
   among taxa.

AB Terrestrial malacofaunas that inhabit islands are vulnerable to human
   activities. Habitat destruction, introduction of exotic species,
   predators, etc. are distorting the composition and distribution of
   indigenous snail communities. Specifically, the taxonomic discordance
   between live and dead assemblages may be the consequence of
   anthropogenic disturbances rather than natural post-mortem processes.
   Live-dead fidelity may hence reflect the degree of human alteration in a
   given locality. This approach was used to study the relative abundance
   of live and dead land snails from pristine and urbanized localities
   around San Salvador Island (Bahamas). Thirteen species were encountered
   from 64 samples containing 5,343 specimens. Taxonomic composition was
   significantly different between areas of negligible anthropogenic
   disturbance and those impacted by humans. Although which species of land
   snails are endemic to San Salvador is unknown, all identified species
   are native to the Caribbean region and invasive species were not
   encountered. However, some synanthropic species, found exclusively in
   urban-developed areas, have not been recovered from the local fossil
   record, pointing to their relatively recent introduction possibly from
   nearby islands. Non-metric MDS, Jaccard-Chao index, and Spearman
   correlation analyses indicated that dead assemblages displayed a good
   compositional correspondence to live communities at pristine sites,
   whereas considerable disparity was sometimes observed at human-modified
   areas. Urbanized areas probably favored the proliferation of
   synanthropic species whereas dead assemblages may contain anthropophobic
   taxa that lived there prior to recent human modification. These findings
   are consistent with previous live-dead fidelity studies of marine
   molluscan and terrestrial small-mammal assemblages, and suggest that the
   taxonomic discordance between live and dead assemblages of land snails
   may be indicative of recent anthropogenic alteration.

AB We present the first, full water column Nd isotope (epsilon(Nd)) and
   concentration data for Caribbean seawater, as well as for stations close
   to the Orinoco River mouth and in the Florida Straits. The surface
   inflow into the southeastern Caribbean via the Guyana Current is
   characterized by an epsilon(Nd) signature of -10.9, which is a
   consequence of the mixing of relatively unradiogenic epsilon(Nd)
   signatures (-13.6) supplied by the Orinoco River with contributions from
   the Amazon River (similar to-10). Despite the proximity to land,
   sub-surface and intermediate waters within the Caribbean largely retain
   the epsilon(Nd) signatures of their source water masses in the Atlantic.
   In contrast, the deep waters of the Caribbean show epsilon(Nd)
   signatures at least 3 epsilon(Nd) units more radiogenic than the
   inflowing Upper North Atlantic Deep Water (UNADW). A epsilon(Nd) shift
   from -13 to -9.7 can be explained by addition of radiogenic Nd to the
   deep Caribbean through weathering inputs from land. However, in order to
   balance such large shifts in epsilon(Nd) with at the same time modest
   increases in Nd concentrations, Nd must also be removed from seawater
   within the basin. It is suggested that the long residence time of deep
   waters in the Caribbean allows significant interaction of seawater with
   sinking particles and seafloor sediments resulting in more radiogenic
   values. These findings have implications for the use of epsilon(Nd) as a
   proxy for paleocirculation in restricted basins, in which the residence
   times of the deep waters are long. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights

AB Amphibian chytridiomycosis occurs on a small proportion of West Indian

   suitable environment for the infection. We report the presence of the
   causative agent Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd) in 2 out of 12
   populations sampled of the Vulnerable Trinidad stream frog, Mannophryne
   trinitatis. We analyzed 184 skin swabs collected from wild frogs using
   real-time PCR analysis. Follow-up sampling determined a prevalence of Bd
   infection of 3 and 23% in these 2 populations. We did not find any
   evidence of associated clinical disease. Bd-positive populations were
   located at the highest elevations studied (425 to 450 m). These 2
   populations had more juveniles than other populations, and juveniles
   were more likely to be infected than adults. Our results suggest that
   sampling juveniles may provide the greatest sensitivity for any future
   monitoring for the presence of Bd in M. trinitatis populations in
   Trinidad.

AB New Guinea is widely known for rich biodiversity. This study provides a
   foundation for understanding vascular and non-vascular plant
   distributions at the genus taxonomic level. Analyses objectively and
   quantitatively showed collection density and biases at 50 km spatial
   resolution and predict genus richness at 1 km spatial resolution. To
   model the distribution of 1354 genera presence-only data and the MaxEnt
   niche model were used. Results showed many cells with fewer than 5
   unique genera whereas other cells had upwards of 600 unique genera.
   Model performance achieved a mean test AUC score of 0.7. The most
   influential environmental variables were elevation, slope, and
   temperature annual range. Predicted genus richness increased from south
   to north across the island and west to east along the central mountain
   range. Models predicted higher richness in topographically complex
   regions at higher elevations. Comparatively, lower elevations with
   homogenous topography had larger tracts of high genus richness. Modeling
   genus level data supplied baseline information about plant
   distributions, yet some genera are more speciose than others, so the
   full scope of richness or endemism may not be captured. Results can be
   used to prioritize sampling needs, support conservation strategies,
   compare genus diversity to other regions, and discuss biogeography
   principles.

AB The small waterstriders of the subfamily Trepobatinae have radiated
   extensively on New Guinea and surrounding archipelagos. The present
   contribution is the sixth in a series of reports dealing with this
   endemic fauna, and presents a cladistic analysis at the generic level
   for the subfamily, a biogeographic analysis, a world checklist, a
   complete bibliography, and final taxonomic addenda. The taxonomic
   appendix contains new distributional records for Stygiobates mubi
   Polhemus & Polhemus, and descriptions of the following new taxa: the new
   genus Talaudia to hold the previously described Andersenella nilsi Chen
   & Nieser from the Talaud Archipelago; Metrobatoides bifurcatus sp. n.
   from northern central Irian Jaya; and Iobates ivimka sp. n. from
   southern Papua New Guinea. The current cladistic analysis supports the
   previously proposed tribal classification, with the Metrobatini,
   Trepobatini, Naboandelini, and Stenobatini all resolved as discrete
   monophyletic groups. Our cladistic and biogeographic analyses also
   suggest that the current distribution of trepobatine genera in the New
   Guinea region has been strongly influenced by past tectonic events, most
   notably the accretion of island arc terranes derived from the Solomons
   and Halmahera arc systems. This has led to distinct areas of freshwater
   and marine endemism among the Metrobatini and Stenobatini in the areas
   surrounding Halmahera, the Vogelkop Peninsula, and northeastern New
   Guinea plus nearby islands. By contrast, the distribution of
   Naboandelini in the New Guinea region suggests a vicariance pattern with
   Australia across the Torres Strait.

AB The invasion by Indo-Pacific lionfish (Pterois volitans and P. miles) of
   the western Atlantic, Caribbean and Gulf of Mexico is emerging as a
   major threat to coral reef communities across the region. Comparing
   native and introduced populations of invasive species can reveal shifts
   in ecology and behaviour that can accompany successful invasions. Using
   standardized field surveys replicated at multiple sites in Kenya and the
   Bahamas, we present the first direct comparisons of lionfish density,
   body size, biomass and behaviour between native and invaded coral reefs.
   We found that lionfish occur at higher densities with larger body sizes
   and total biomass on invaded Bahamian coral reefs than the ecologically
   equivalent species (P. miles) does on native Kenyan reefs. However, the
   combined average density of the five lionfish species (Pterois miles, P.
   antennata, P. radiata, Dendrochirus brachypterus and D. zebra) on Kenyan
   reefs was similar to the density of invasive lionfish in the Bahamas.
   Understanding the ecological processes that drive these differences can
   help inform the management and control of invasive lionfish.

AB Boelen's python (Morelia boeleni) is a montane New Guinea endemic found
   in highlands above 1000 m and below the tree line. The ecology, natural
   history, distribution, population size, and conservation status of this
   species are largely unknown. It has a protected status in Papua New
   Guinea but not in Indonesian Papua and several US and European zoos have
   active captive breeding programs that have been largely unsuccessful. To
   understand the degree of genetic diversity in wild and captive animals
   we undertook a genetic analysis of 90 M. boeleni for which we sequenced
   two mtDNA loci and one nuclear locus for a total of 1,418 bp of sequence
   data per individual. All 16 wild-caught M. boeleni from Indonesia and
   all captive M. boeleni are genetically uniform for all three loci. The
   single wild-caught animal from Papua New Guinea showed extremely low
   levels of genetic divergence and diversity from the Indonesian and
   captive samples. Data from two congeners, M. amethistina and M. viridis,
   suggests that M. boeleni have reduced genetic variation with a small
   effective population size possibly due to historical bottlenecks. These
   data demonstrate the need for further studies of genetic diversity of M.
   boeleni from across its range and raise particular concern for the
   limited genetic diversity of M. boeleni used captive breeding programs
   in zoological parks.

AB Beach erosion presents a hazard to coastal tourism facilities, which
   provide the main economic thrust for most Caribbean small islands
   (CSIs). Ad hoc approaches to addressing this problem have given way to
   the integrated coastal zone management (ICZM) approach, which recommends
   data collection, analysis of coastal processes, and assessment of
   impacts. UNESCO's Coast and Beach Stability in the Caribbean (COSALC)
   project has provided most CSIs with an opportunity to monitor their
   beaches and collect over 10 years of data. Research has been directed at
   integrating these data with geographic information systems (GIS) and
   other information technologies to develop a prototype beach analysis and
   management system (BAMS) for CSIs. This article presents the results of
   phase I development of this effort, which includes the development of
   tools for integrating spatial and non-spatial coastal data, estimating
   long-term beach erosion/accretion and sand volume change trends at
   individual beaches, identifying erosion-sensitive beaches, and mapping
   beach erosion hazards. The Southeast Peninsula, St. Kitts, is used as a
   case study to develop these tools and demonstrate system functionality.

AB Indo-Pacific lionfish, the Red Lionfish Pterois volitans and the Devil
   Firefish P. miles, are nonnative marine fish that have invaded the
   western North Atlantic Ocean, Caribbean Sea, and Gulf of Mexico. Rapid
   population growth of this invasive predator threatens native fish
   communities. A bioenergetics model was developed for lionfish (i.e.,
   both species) and then applied to estimate the potential impact of these
   predators on a reef fish community. We conducted a series of laboratory
   trials to evaluate consumption and respiration rates between 14 degrees
   C and 32 degrees C for lionfish weighing from 20 to 400g. Water
   temperature greatly influenced consumption; mean daily consumption rates
   increased from 14 degrees C to 29.7 degrees C and declined at 32.5
   degrees C. Energy density of the prey was the most sensitive parameter
   in the model and estimates of food consumption corresponded with
   empirical and laboratory estimates. To realize population-level impacts,
   we applied the bioenergetics model to a size-structured virtual
   population of 393 lionfish/ha on a reef in the Bahamas. Model
   simulations estimated that this population would annually consume 929kg
   of prey/ha when feeding at 60% of maximum consumption. This model
   provides the first comprehensive assessment of lionfish bioenergetics
   accounting for the effects of size and temperature on prey consumption
   and improves the capacity to evaluate the trophic impacts of lionfish in
   the Atlantic Ocean.

AB Tropical marine protected areas (MPAs) may promote conditions that are
   attractive to dive tourists, but a systematic basis for assessing their
   effectiveness in this regard is currently lacking. We therefore
   interviewed 195 dive tourists in Jamaica to determine which reef
   attributes they most preferred to see on dives. Attributes relating to
   fishes and other large animals ('big fishes','other large
   animals','variety of fishes','abundance of fishes', and 'unusual
   fishes') were more appreciated than those relating to reef structure and
   benthos ('reef structure e.g., drop-offs', 'variety of corals','large
   corals','coral cover','unusual corals', 'sponges', 'unusual algae',
   'lobsters, crabs etc.'). We then surveyed reef condition with regard to
   those aspects (abundance and variety of fishes, number of 'unusual', and
   number of 'large' fish) at four Caribbean MPAs and reference areas. In
   two cases, Hol Chan Marine Reserve in Belize and Parque Nacional Punta
   Frances in Cuba, these fish attributes were more pronounced in the MPAs
   than in the reference areas. Differences between the Montego Bay Marine
   Park in Jamaica (MBMP) and adjacent reference areas were mainly
   restricted to shallow sites (<6m), while at Grand Cayman no differences
   between fully protected and partially protected areas were detected.
   Management had not been fully effective in the MBMP in the preceding
   months, while fishing pressure in the partially protected areas on Grand
   Cayman was very light. We conclude that, if fishing restrictions are
   well enforced, western Caribbean MPAs can be expected to be effective in
   ways appreciated by dive tourists.

   marked variability in global sea level and climate. Results were
   consistent for surveys of both common and rare taxa. Comparison of

AB Taxonomic identifications and vernacular names are given of insects as
   well as some spiders which are consumed as food by members of the
   following ethnic communities: Ao-Naga (North-east India), Chimbu (Papua
   New Guinea, Central Highlands), Onabasulu (Papua New Guinea, Southern
   Highlands), Kiriwina (Western Pacific, Trobriand Islands), Walbiri
   (Central Australian desert), Pintupi (Central Australian desert), and
   Maori (New Zealand, Aotearoa). Differences and similarities of
   entomophagy habits between the groups are examined in the light of
   cultural, ethnic, and linguistic relationships. It is postulated that
   prehistorically two centres in the region under discussion existed where
   entomophagy evolved and from where the practice spread: Southern India
   and South-east Asia. It is further postulated that the sugar-containing
   insects were the first to find a place in the regular diet of
   prehistoric man, followed by insects which were rich in fats and lipids,
   and finally those which contained mostly protein. According to this
   scenario Australian Aborigines belong to the earliest group of insect
   eaters. Evidence is also presented that the domestication of the silk
   worm and the use of its product (i.e. silk) could have arisen from the
   practice of eating wild silkworm larvae and pupae in North-east India.
   Finally, a plea is made to fund research into the many uses of insects
   in traditional societies, before it is too late and such information is
   irretrievably lost.

AB Premise of research. Biogeography has improved understanding of
   evolution and diversification of organisms on both continental and
   island systems. One complicated island group in terms of geological
   history and biogeographic pattern is the Caribbean island system. A
   comparison across taxonomic groups does not result in overarching
   patterns for this group of islands. Columnea has the greatest number of
   species endemic to the Caribbean for any genus in Gesneriaceae that is
   not mostly endemic to the Caribbean with 16 species. Thirteen of these
   species are found on Jamaica, the remaining three each endemic to Cuba,
   Hispaniola, and Puerto Rico. In addition, populations of Columnea
   sanguinea and Columnea scandens are known from both mainland and
   multiple Caribbean islands. We investigate the pattern of evolution in
   Caribbean species of Columnea and attempt to explain the large number of
   species found on the island of Jamaica relative to the other islands. We
   explicitly test whether Caribbean species of Columnea are monophyletic
   and whether the 13 species endemic to Jamaica are a monophyletic group.
   This genus can help understand biogeographic patterns and modes of
   speciation in the Caribbean. Methodology. We sampled all Caribbean
   species of Columnea using DNA sequence data and phylogenetic methods to
   understand the pattern of diversity to determine whether multiple or
   single introductions could explain the diversity on the Caribbean
   islands. Pivotal results. The Caribbean species do not form a
   monophyletic group. The Jamaican species are monophyletic, and the
   endemic Cuban species, Columnea tincta, is sister to 12 of the Jamaican
   species, with Columnea pubescens sister to C. tincta + remaining
   Jamaican species. Most Jamaican species share similar corolla
   morphologies to section Columnea. Although never recovered as part of
   section Columnea, approximately unbiased tests cannot reject a sister
   group relationship of the Jamaican/Cuban endemic clade to section
   Columnea but can reject inclusion in section Columnea. Conclusions. The
   high diversity of Columnea in the Caribbean is due to the
   disproportionate number of species on Jamaica, but there is no obvious
   explanation for the radiation on this island, despite considering island
   size, topography, pollinators, and dispersers. The large number of
   species could be attributed to over-splitting on Jamaica, but even if a
   narrower concept were followed, and four of the species were combined as
   varieties of Columnea hirsuta as earlier taxonomy had predicted, the
   number of morphologically distinctive species would still be nine and
   much greater than that of the other islands. Our data also indicate that
   C. hirsuta sensu lato is not monophyletic.

AB Taro (Colocasia esculenta (L.) Schott) plays a prominent role in the
   economies and cultures of Pacific Island countries such as Fiji.
   Unfortunately, taro is highly susceptible to invasion from taro beetles,
   which burrow into the corms and weaken the plants, rendering them
   unmarkable and prone to rot. Papuana uninodis Prell, an invasive alien
   species that is native to the Solomon Islands and Vanuatu, was first
   reported on Viti Levu (Fiji's largest island) in 1984. Since that time,
   taro production on Viti Levu has fallen substantially. In this paper, we
   employ data from surveys of households and communities to document the
   impacts of P. uninodis on Viti Levu. We then identify three management
   approaches-chemical controls, cultural controls, and switching from taro
   to another staple crop-and conduct a cost-benefit analysis of each. We
   find strong arguments for pursuing chemical control, which derives a net
   present value of monetised benefits of about FJ$139,500 per hectare over
   50 yr, or >FJ$21 for each FJ$1 spent. Still, any of the three management
   options is more efficient than no management, even without any attempt
   to quantify the benefits to biodiversity or forest protection,
   underscoring the value of actively managing this invasive alien species.

AB The "seven-coloured earth" of Chamarel is a geological curiosity and a
   major tourist attraction of Mauritius. This is a small (similar to 7500
   m(2)) area of strikingly bare landscape showing well-developed rills and
   various shades of red, brown, grey, and purple. Curiously, it is located
   within a large, dense forest. Prevalent misconceptions are that the
   landscape formed due to a volcanic eruption, or from volcanic ash.
   Whereas the bedrock is undoubtedly an old volcanic rock (basalt), the
   colours are due to weathering of the basalt and the formation of
   secondary iron oxides and hydroxides in it, and the rilling is a result
   of deforestation and sheet erosion, i.e., human modification of the
   landscape. Such features, inadequately described in the literature so
   far, also occur in Papua New Guinea, and may be common in tropical,
   high-rainfall regions with volcanic bedrock. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All

AB Objective: The purpose of this study was to determine if the exotic
   venomous species, Pterois volitans (lionfish) had reached as far south
   as St Vincent in the Caribbean. This predatory marine fish has
   successfully invaded the waters of the Western Atlantic and the
   Caribbean. Such success as an exotic invasive species is rare for a
   predatory marine fish. It is possible that the fish are growing larger
   and spreading faster than anticipated, thanks to a lower burden of
   parasites and a paucity of natural predators in their new environment.
   But prior to this report, no sightings of this species this far south
   had been reported.
   Methods: The authors conducted a search along with the help of local
   divers and fishermen in the waters of St Vincent.
   Results: Approximately one year after the initiation of the search, a
   juvenile specimen was positively confirmed and captured off the southern
   coast of St Vincent.
   Conclusions: The exotic predatory and venomous red lionfish, Pterois
   volitans, has successfully invaded marine waters as far south as the
   Windward Islands. Fishermen in these regions should be aware of this
   venomous species in the region and physicians must be aware of how to
   manage stings from such animals.

AB End-of-century changes in Caribbean climate extremes are derived from

   climate model (RCM) under the A2 and B2 emission scenarios across five
   rainfall zones. Trends in rainfall, maximum temperature, and minimum
   temperature extremes from the RCM are validated against meteorological
   stations over 1979-1989. The model displays greater skill at
   representing trends in consecutive wet days (CWD) and extreme rainfall
   (R95P) than consecutive dry days (CDD), wet days (R10), and maximum
   5-day precipitation (RX5). Trends in warm nights, cool days, and warm
   days were generally well reproduced. Projections for 2071-2099 relative
   to 1961-1989 are obtained from the ECHAM5 driven RCM. Northern and
   eastern zones are projected to experiencemore intense rainfall under A2
   and B2. There is less consensus across scenarios with respect to changes
   in the dry and wet spell lengths. However, there is indication that a
   drying trendmay be manifest over zone 5 (Trinidad and northern Guyana).
   Changes in the extreme temperature indices generally suggest a warmer
   Caribbean towards the end of century across both scenarios with the
   strongest changes over zone 4 (eastern Caribbean).

AB The culturable diversity of endophytic actinomycetes associated with

   endophytic actinomycetes were isolated from tropical plants collected
   from several locations in Papua New Guinea and Mborokua Island, Solomon
   Islands. Isolates were found to be prevalent in roots but uncommon in
   leaves. Initially, isolates were dereplicated to the strain level by
   ribotyping. Subsequent characterization of 105 unique strains by 16S
   rRNA gene sequence analysis revealed that 17 different genera were
   represented, and rare genera, such as Sphaerisporangium and
   Planotetraspora, which have never been previously reported to be
   endophytic, were quite prevalent. Phylogenetic analyses grouped many of
   the strains into clades distinct from known genera within
   Thermomonosporaceae and Micromonosporaceae, indicating that they may be
   unique genera. Bioactivity testing and liquid chromatography-mass
   spectrometry (LC-MS) profiling of crude fermentation extracts were
   performed on 91 strains. About 60% of the extracts exhibited bioactivity
   or displayed LC-MS profiles with spectra indicative of secondary
   metabolites. The biosynthetic potential of 29 nonproductive strains was
   further investigated by the detection of putative polyketide synthase
   (PKS) and nonribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS) genes. Despite their
   lack of detectable secondary metabolite production in fermentation, most
   were positive for type I (66%) and type II (79%) PKS genes, and all were
   positive for NRPS genes. These results suggest that tropical plants from
   New Guinea and the adjacent archipelago are hosts to unique endophytic
   actinomycetes that possess significant biosynthetic potential.

   species of marine turtles, two of which (Eretmochelys imbricata and
   Chelonia mydas) are known to nest on the nation's numerous sandy beaches
   and forage in nearshore waters. The low-lying and largely sedimentary
   islands of Antigua (280 km2) and Barbuda (161 km2) formed a single
   island as recently as 12,000 years ago and exhibit a similar
   herpetofauna with high endemicity. At least four terrestrial species are
   endemic to the Antigua and Barbuda bank: Alsophis antiguae, Ameiva
   griswoldi, Anolis wattsi, Sphaerodactylus elegantulus (a possible fifth
   being Barbuda's Anolis forresti, if not synonymous with A wattsi), and a
   further five are Lesser Antillean endemics. Only six species have been
   documented on the small, rugged volcanic island of Redonda (1 km2), but
   as many as half of them occur nowhere else (Ameiva atrata, Anolis
   nubilus, and a potentially new Sphaerodactylus sp.). Centuries of forest
   clearance, overgrazing and development, coupled with the introduction of
   small Asian mongooses (Herpestes javanicus), black rats (Rattus rattus)
   and other alien invasive species, has endangered many of the nation's
   wildlife, and at least four indigenous reptiles have been extirpated
   (Boa constrictor, Clelia Celia, Iguana delicatissima, and Leiocephalus
   cuneus). Recent moves to enlarge the nation's protected area network are
   encouraging, but need to be supported with stronger legislation and
   proper investment in management staff and resources. This paper presents
   conservation recommendations and describes two projects that have
   adopted innovative approaches to save the most critically endangered

AB The most recent deglaciation resulted in a global sea-level rise of some
   120 m over approximately 12 000 years. In this Part I of two parts, a
   moving boundary numerical model is developed to predict the response of
   rivers to this rise. The model was motivated by experiments at small
   scale, which have identified two modes describing the transgression of a
   river mouth: autoretreat without abandonment of the river delta (no
   sediment starvation at the topset-foreset break) and sediment-starved
   autoretreat with abandonment of the delta. In the latter case,
   transgression is far more rapid and its effects are felt much further
   upstream of the river mouth. The moving boundary numerical model is
   checked against experiments. The generally favourable results of the
   check motivate adaptation of the model to describe the response of the
   much larger Fly-Strickland River system, Papua New Guinea to Holocene
   sea-level rise; this is done in the companion paper, Part II.

AB This paper examines physical, chemical, and biological properties of
   soils and sediments from landforms in eastern Antigua, West Indies, to
   better understand the long-term consequences of colonial plantation
   agriculture for soil health. Plantation farming played a central role in
   the history of Caribbean societies, economies, and environments since
   the seventeenth century. In Antigua, the entire island was variably
   dedicated to agricultural pursuits (mostly sugarcane monoculture) from
   the mid-1600s until independence from the United Kingdom in 1981, when
   most commercial cultivation ceased. Today's soilscapes are highly
   degraded, although it is unknown what the role of the island's
   plantation legacy has played in this process. Our research combines
   geoarchaeological survey and sampling, sediment core analysis, and
   historical archival research to model the initial and cumulative impacts
   of the plantation industry on the island. We focus on the region
   surrounding Betty's Hope, the island's first large-scale sugarcane
   plantation in operation from 1674 to 1944. We find that current erosion
   and degradation issues experienced by today's farmers are not
   attributable to intensive plantation farming alone, but rather are part
   of a complex mosaic of human-environmental interactions that include
   abandonment of engineered landscapes.

AB Comparison between planktic foraminiferal oxygen isotope records from
   the Caribbean Sea (Ocean Drilling Program [ODP] Site 999) and the
   equatorial east Pacific (ODP Site 851) suggests an increase in Caribbean
   surface-water salinity between 4.7 and 4.2 Ma. The modern
   Atlantic-Pacific salinity contrast of about 1 parts per thousand became
   fully established at 4.2 Ma as reflected by a 0.5 parts per thousand
   planktic foraminifera O-18 enrichment in the Caribbean Sea. This is
   interpreted as the result of restricted surface-water exchange between
   the tropical Atlantic and Pacific in response to the shoaling of the
   Central American seaway. As a consequence, the Atlantic and Pacific
   surface-ocean circulation regime changed, as did the freshwater balance
   between the major ocean basins. Simultaneous shifts in benthic carbon
   isotope records in the Caribbean Sea suggest an intensification in North
   Atlantic thermohaline circulation. These results indicate that the
   Panamanian isthmus formation caused several new ocean-atmosphere
   feedback mechanisms that have affected climate since the early Pliocene.

   Epidemiologic investigation revealed that there were 174 cases among 187

   served sandwiches containing egg products that had undergone severe
   time-temperature abuse. While no causal agents were identified, the
   epidemiology and clinical presentation is compatible with foodborne
   toxins, most likely enterotoxins of either Staphylococcus aureus or
   Bacillus cereus. Mitigation measures undertaken by public health
   centered on education of food preparers and the general public regarding
   safe food preparation practices. This large outbreak serves to remind us
   that, while there are simple and highly effective measures to prevent
   such foodborne disease outbreaks, we in the public health sector have a
   duty to improve the community's knowledge and understanding of these
   measures.

AB Papua New Guinea is the third largest remaining area of tropical forest
   after the Amazon and Congo basins. However, the growing intensity of
   large-scale slash-and-burn agriculture and logging call for conservation
   research to assess how local people's traditional land-use practices
   result in conservation of local biodiversity, of which a species-rich
   and diverse component is the avian community. With this in mind, I
   conducted a preliminary survey of birds in small-scale secondary plots
   and in adjacent primary forest in Wanang Conservation Area in Papua New
   Guinea. I used mist-netting, point counts, and transect walks to compare
   the bird communities of 7-year-old secondary growth, and neighboring
   primary forest. The preliminary survey lasted 10 days and was conducted
   during the dry season (July) of 2008. I found no significant differences
   in summed bird abundances between forest types. However, species
   richness was higher in primary forest (98 species) than in secondary (78
   species). The response of individual feeding guilds was also variable.
   Two habitats differed mainly in presence of canopy frugivores, which
   were more abundant (more than 80%) in primary than in secondary forests.
   A large difference (70%) was found also in understory and mid-story
   insectivores. Species occurring mainly in secondary forest were Hooded
   Butcherbird (Cracticus cassicus), Brown Oriole (Oriolus szalayi), and
   Helmeted Friarbird (Philemon buceroides). Examples of primary forest
   species were Red-bellied Pitta (Pitta erythrogaster), Little Kingfisher
   (Alcedo pusilla), and Zoe's Imperial Pigeon (Ducula zoeae). My results
   suggest that changes in bird assemblages occur even in relatively
   undisturbed landscapes in response to small-scale shifting agriculture
   that is crucial for local people's livelihood; it also seems that
   traditional land use by local people favors the persistence of a rich
   bird species pool in the forested and traditionally managed landscape.

AB Background: We examined species composition of forest and bird
   communities in relation to environmental and human disturbance gradients
   on Lakeba (55.9 km(2)), Nayau (18.4 km(2)), and Aiwa Levu (1.2 km(2)),
   islands in the Lau Group of Fiji, West Polynesia. The unique avifauna of
   West Polynesia (Fiji, Tonga, Samoa) has been subjected to prehistoric
   human-caused extinctions but little was previously known about this
   topic in the Lau Group. We expected that the degree of human disturbance
   would be a strong determinant of tree species composition and habitat
   quality for surviving landbirds, while island area would be unrelated to
   bird diversity.
   Methodology/Principal Findings: All trees >5 cm diameter were measured
   and identified in 23 forest plots of 500 m(2) each. We recognized four
   forest species assemblages differentiated by composition and structure:
   coastal forest, dominated by widely distributed species, and three
   forest types with differences related more to disturbance history
   (stages of secondary succession following clearing or selective logging)
   than to environmental gradients (elevation, slope, rockiness). Our point
   counts (73 locations in 1 or 2 seasons) recorded 18 of the 24 species of
   landbirds that exist on the three islands. The relative abundance and
   species richness of birds were greatest in the forested habitats least
   disturbed by people. These differences were due mostly to increased
   numbers of columbid frugivores and passerine insectivores in forests on
   Lakeba and Aiwa Levu. Considering only forested habitats, the relative
   abundance and species richness of birds were greater on the small but
   completely forested (and uninhabited) island of Aiwa Levu than on the
   much larger island of Lakeba.
   Conclusions/Significance: Forest disturbance history is more important
   than island area in structuring both tree and landbird communities on
   remote Pacific islands. Even very small islands may be suitable for
   conservation reserves if they are protected from human disturbance.

AB [1] Hydrographic transects suggest an eastward flow with a subsurface
   core along the entire southern boundary of the Caribbean Sea. The
   transport of the coastal limb of the Panama-Colombia Gyre (PCG), known
   as the Panama-Colombia Countercurrent, decreases toward the east (from
   similar to6 Sv off Panama), as water is lost into the recirculation of
   the PCG. Off Panama, the flow is strongest at the surface, but, off
   Colombia, it is strongest at around 100 m. A portion of the counterflow
   (similar to1 Sv) continues eastward along the Colombian coast as far as
   the Guajira region (12degreesN, 72degreesW), where it submerges to
   become an undercurrent beneath the coastal upwelling center there. The
   eastward flow also occurs in the Venezuela Basin, beneath the coastal
   upwelling region off Cariaco Basin and exits the Caribbean through the
   Grenada Channel at around 200 m depth. Numerical simulations suggest
   that this flow, counter to the Caribbean Current, is a semi-continuous
   feature along the entire southern boundary of the Caribbean, and that it
   is associated with offshore cyclonic eddies. It probably constitutes
   part of the Sverdrup circulation of the Tropical North Atlantic cyclonic
   cell.

AB Coastal biodiversity is threatened worldwide by both direct and indirect
   anthropogenic activities. To more effectively manage and protect coastal
   biodiversity, accurate assessments of genetic, species, and ecosystem
   level diversity are required. We present the results from an assessment
   of the aquatic species diversity of a small (3 km(2)), shallow,
   mangrove-fringed Bahamian lagoon (the North Sound) subject to ongoing
   anthropogenic development. The assessment was conducted through a
   collation of field observations and data in published literature. We
   found that eight angiosperm species, 30 macroalgal species, and 370
   animal species (including 95 fishes, 69 arthropods, 56 birds, and 45
   mollusks) were documented within the lagoon. At least 11 of these
   species are of conservation concern, such as the critically endangered
   smalltooth sawfish (Pristis pectinata) and hawksbill turtle
   (Eretmochelys imbricata). Comparisons of community similarity indicated
   that the North Sound has a relatively distinct fauna and flora, but
   available data suggest that the species found there are most similar to
   those found in nearby habitats in Cuba. The lagoon forms a key nursery
   habitat for many species, including lemon sharks (Negaprion
   brevirostris), Caribbean spiny lobsters (Panulirus argus), and queen
   conch (Strombas gigas). Recently, the lagoon was included as part of a
   new marine protected area (MPA), but much of the habitat has already
   experienced considerable anthropogenic disturbance and the MPA
   boundaries have yet to be established. We have therefore analyzed the
   lagoon biodiversity and expect the data presented here to serve as a
   baseline for future comparisons.

   country's politics and corruption. Ultimately consumers have been
   plagued by persistent water woes to the extent that they have resisted
   increased water rates. The aim of this article is to diagnose policy
   failures that hampered water provision from the mid-1980s to mid-1990s.

AB This work discusses potential transport pathways of terrigenous material
   in the Gulf of Papua (GoP), New Guinea, using Lagrangian tracers as
   proxies for clay minerals and finer particles. The tracers are
   transported by currents from the East Asia Seas implementation of the
   Navy Coastal Ocean Model. The results suggest that clay minerals input
   from rivers along the northwest coast of the GoP accumulate on the inner
   shelf with high concentrations near the mouth of the Fly and Purari
   Rivers. Finer particles, which are also representative of dissolved
   metals, are transported eastward along the GoP coast into the Solomon
   Sea as well as into the Torres Strait to the west. The results also
   suggest that some finer particles are entrained by eddies within the
   northern Coral Sea. These results are in qualitative agreement with
   observations from the region.

AB Fore reefs at Horseshoe Reef, Tobago Cays, had an average live
   stony-coral cover of 30% at 3-4 m and nearly 40% at 9-11 m in June 1999.
   "Large corals" (>=25 cm maximum diameter) were dominated by Montastraea
   annularis, Porites astreoides and P. pontes. However, live colonies of
   Acropora palmata, which once flourished in the high-energy shallow-reef
   zones, had virtually disappeared. The maximum diameter of large reef
   corals averaged 58 cm which may be indicative of steady juvenile
   replenishment. The low values of recent partial-colony mortality (<=3%)
   and minor disease occurrences (<=6% of colonies) at all sites indicated
   that the large corals on Horseshoe Reef had experienced no major recent
   disturbance events. Pale, or partially bleached, colonies on the deeper
   reefs (about 10% of large corals) were probably still recovering from
   the 1998 mass bleaching event. Algal communities in the shallower reefs
   were dominated by crustose coralline algae (>50% relative abundance)
   whereas macroalgae (mainly Halimeda and Dictyota) were slightly more
   abundant than crustose corallines at 9-11 m. Diadema antillarum was
   uncommon in the deeper reefs but moderately abundant at 3-4 m.
   Eighty-one species of fish were recorded at Horseshoe Reef. The
   assemblage of censused fishes was dominated by herbivorous scarids
   (parrotfishes) and acanthurids (surgeonfishes). Herbivores, scarids in
   particular, also accounted for most of the censused fish biomass on the
   reef. Commercially valuable serranids, lutjanids and haemulids
   (groupers, snappers, grunts) were present in low densities (<1
   individual/100m2), indicative of overfishing.

   International Physical Activity Questionnaire was used to evaluate
   physical activity, and dietary patterns were assessed by per-week
   consumption frequency of food items. Principal component analysis was
   applied to produce a composite score for socioeconomic status. Least
   square regression analysis indicated that socioeconomic status was
   positively correlated with consumption of a traditional diet (p=.03) and
   negatively with walking-related physical activity (p=.02), but it was
   not correlated with MET-minutes of moderate/vigorous activity. Different
   patterns of nutritional transition occur among migrants in urban Papua
   New Guinea, depending on socioeconomic status.

AB Breadfruit (Artocarpus, Moraceae) is grown throughout the tropics yet
   only a few cultivars are found in most countries. Three species, A.
   altilis, A. camansi, and A. mariannensis, plus natural hybrids (A.
   altilis x A. mariannensis) make up the breadfruit complex. It is one of
   the crops covered by the International Treaty on Plant Genetic Resources
   for Food and Agriculture and a breadfruit conservation strategy is being
   developed for the Global Crop Diversity Trust. Although an important
   staple crop in the Pacific with hundreds of recognized cultivars,
   breadfruit diversity is declining because of hurricane and drought
   damage and loss of cultural knowledge. Several ex situ collections were
   planted in the Pacific region in the 20th century, with materials widely
   exchanged. Provenance data are unavailable for most and those
   collections were neglected or abandoned. Actively managed breadfruit
   germplasm collections exist in Vanuatu, Samoa, the USDA National Plant
   Germplasm System, and the University of the West Indies (Trinidad and
   Jamaica). The National Tropical Botanical Garden (NTBG) in Hawaii
   manages a field genebank of breadfruit species and cultivars with 220
   accessions from 18 Pacific Island groups, the Philippines, the
   Seychelles, Indonesia and Honduras. Research on the NTBG collection
   includes chromosome counts, isozyme and amplified fragment length
   polymorphism (AFLP) analyses, morphological descriptors, seasonality and
   yields as well as nutritional composition and fruit quality sensory
   evaluation for 20 cultivars. In vitro propagation research is underway
   to develop methods to conserve and exchange breadfruit germplasm. Making
   the numerous good-quality flavorful cultivars more widely available will
   provide nutritious food and trees for sustainable agriculture,
   agroforestry, home gardens and income generation.

AB The large-scale ocean-atmosphere patterns that influence the interannual
   variability of Caribbean-Central American rainfall are examined. The
   atmospheric circulation over this region is shaped by the competition
   between the North Atlantic subtropical high sea level pressure system
   and the eastern Pacific ITCZ, which influence the convergence patterns
   on seasonal and interannual timescales.
   The authors find the leading modes of interannual sea level pressure
   (SLP) and SST variability associated with Caribbean rainfall, as
   selected by canonical correlation analysis, to be an interbasin mode,
   linking the eastern Pacific with the tropical Atlantic, and an Atlantic
   mode. North Atlantic SLP affects Caribbean rainfall directly, by
   changing the patterns of surface how over the region, and indirectly,
   through SST anomalies. Anomalously high SLP in the region of the North
   Atlantic high translates into stronger trade winds, hence cooler SSTs,
   and less Caribbean rainfall. The interbasin mode, which manifests itself
   as a zonal seesaw in SLP between the tropical Atlantic and the eastern
   equatorial Pacific, is correlated with ENSO. When SLP is low in the
   eastern equatorial Pacific. it is high in the tropical Atlantic: the
   surface atmospheric Row over the basin is divergent, to the west, toward
   the eastern Pacific ITCZ, and to the east, toward the tropical North
   Atlantic. A weakened meridional SLP gradient in the tropical North
   Atlantic signifies weaker trade winds and the opportunity for SSTs to
   warm up, reaching peak intensity 2-4 months after the mature phase of an
   ENSO event. This SST anomaly is particularly evident in the
   Caribbean-western Atlantic basin.
   The tendency is for drier-than-average conditions when the divergent
   atmospheric flow dominates, during the rainy season preceding the mature
   phase of a warm ENSO event. The dry season that coincides with the
   mature phase of ENSO is wetter than average over the northwestern
   section of the basin, that is, Yucatan, the Caribbean coast of Honduras,
   and Cuba, and drier than average over the rest of the basin, that is,
   Costa Rica and northern South America. The following spring, as the
   atmospheric circulation transitions to normal conditions, the positive
   SST anomaly that has built up in the basin takes over, favoring
   convection The positive precipitation anomaly spreads southeastward,
   from the northwest to the entire basin. At the start of a new rainy
   season, it is especially strong over the Greater Antilles.

AB Slattery & Lesser (2015; Mar Ecol Prog Ser 527: 275-279) offer a Comment
   on our review of the literature for evidence of bottom-up control of

   presented in the Comment and reiterate the lack of evidence for food
   limitation, including inter-oceanic comparisons of Caribbean reefs with
   Indo-Pacific oligotrophic reefs, where sponge communities show strong
   evidence of food limitation, and past and recent evidence for the
   importance of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) in sponge nutrition. We did
   not claim that 'predation is the primary process that determines the
   growth, biomass and biodiversity of sponges on Caribbean coral reefs,'
   but we identified 3 depth-related factors that influence sponge
   community structure on Caribbean reefs: turbulence, spatial competition
   and predation. We agree that multifactorial manipulative experiments are
   the best way to address the interaction between top-down and bottom-up
   processes in this system; indeed, one such experiment has been
   performed, with an outcome that does not support bottom-up effects.

   or mixtures of food types were placed in these vessels. This suggests a
   high degree of consistency in the use of Lapita decorated pots,
   irrespective of the morphological and stylistic variation of these
   vessels. Data obtained from single-compound isotope analysis are also
   not consistent with marine resources as potential food sources for
   Lapita vessels. The absence of such commonly consumed, ubiquitous and
   easily accessible resources in Lapita vessels suggests that these pots
   were not manufactured to be used for ordinary occasions and day-to-day
   food consumption. This is the first time tangible data related to the
   use of these vessels are provided to support this claim in addition to

   building on and using the natural and local resource base without
   exhausting it, while enhancing biodiversity, optimizing
   complementarities between crops and animal systems and finally
   increasing opportunities in rural livelihoods. Focusing our analysis and
   discussion on field experiences and empirical knowledge in the Caribbean
   islands, this paper discusses the opportunities for a change needed in
   current MFS research-development philosophy. The importance of shifting
   from fragile/specialized production systems to MFS under current global
   conditions is argued with an emphasis on the case of Small Islands
   Developing States (SIDS) and the Caribbean. Particular vulnerable
   characteristics as well as the potential and constraints of SIDS and
   their agricultural sectors are described, while revealing the
   opportunities for the 'richness' of the natural and local resources to
   support authentic and less dependent production system strategies.
   Examples are provided of the use of natural grasses, legumes, crop
   residues and agro-industrial by-products. We analyse the requirement for
   a change in research strategies and initiatives through the development
   of a complex but necessary multi-/inter-/trans-disciplinary teamwork
   spirit. We stress as essential the collaboration and active
   participation of local and regional actors, stakeholders and end-users
   in the identification of research priorities, as well as the generation,
   exchange and dissemination of knowledge and technology innovations,
   while strengthening the leadership roles in the conduct of integrative
   and participative research and development projects.

AB Small Island Developing States (SIDS) classified as Least Developed
   Countries (LDCs) are particularly vulnerable to the projected impacts of
   climate change. Given their particular vulnerabilities, climate
   adaptation investments are being made through both national and
   international efforts to build the capacity of various sectors and
   communities to reduce climate risks and associated disasters. Despite
   these efforts, reducing climate risks is not free of various challenges
   and barriers. This paper aims to synthesise a set of critical
   socio-economic barriers present at various spatial scales that are
   specific to Least Developed Country SIDS. It also aims to identify the
   processes that give rise to these barriers. Drawing on theories from
   natural hazards, a systematic literature review method was adopted to
   identify and organise the set of barriers by focussing on both academic
   papers and grey literature. The data revealed a notable lack of studies
   on adaptation within African and Caribbean LDC-SIDS. In general, there
   was a paucity of academic as well as grey literature being produced by
   authors from LDC-SIDS to challenge existing discourses related to
   adaptation barriers. The most common barriers identified included those
   related to governance, technical, cognitive and cultural. Three key
   findings can be drawn from this study in relation to formal adaptation
   initiatives. Firstly, the lack of focus on the adaptive capacity needs
   of Local Government or Island Councils and communities was a key barrier
   to ensure success of adaptation interventions. Secondly, international
   adaptation funding modalities did little to address root causes of
   vulnerability or support system transformations. These funds were geared
   at supporting sectoral level adaptation initiatives for vulnerable
   natural resource sectors such as water, biodiversity and coastal zones.
   Thirdly, there is a need to recognise the significance of cultural
   knowledge and practices in shaping adaptive choices of communities in
   SIDS. (C) 2014 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB Small Island Developing States (SIDS) of the Pacific over the last
   decade have established some of the most ambitious renewable energy
   targets in the world. The promotion of renewable energy has been
   motivated by a desire to lessen dependence on fossil fuels, given the
   adverse economic impacts of high oil prices on these countries. Efforts
   to attract development assistance and to strengthen the position of
   Pacific SIDS in climate change negotiations have likely also played a
   role. This paper explores the development of renewable energy resources
   in the Pacific through a public policy lens. The ambitious renewable
   energy targets established by Pacific SIDS are argued to be appropriate
   in some cases, but in other cases are criticised on economic grounds. A
   potential trade-off is identified between the risk mitigation benefits
   and poverty alleviation benefits of different renewable technology
   investments, with questions raised about whether support for the former
   rather than the latter by development partners is appropriate. A number
   of institutional and financial challenges to the development of
   renewable energy resources in Pacific SIDS are also discussed.

AB Tropical coral reef monitoring relies heavily on in situ diver
   observations. However, in many reef regions resources are not available
   to regularly monitor reefs. This lack of historical baseline data makes
   it difficult to determine how different reefs respond to environmental
   stressors and what the implications are for management. To test whether
   coral cores could be used to identify bleaching events retrospectively,
   three sites in Tobago with pre-existing reef data including water
   quality and bleaching observations were identified. Colpophyllia natans
   cores were examined for growth anomalies which occurred during periods
   of thermal stress. If present, anomalies were compared to in situ,
   real-time bleaching observations and water quality data. Interestingly,
   sites with better water quality during the 2005 thermal anomaly were
   less prone to bleaching. We suggest that by reducing terrestrial run-off
   (e.g., sediment and nutrients), and therefore improving marine water
   quality, reef managers could enhance near-shore coral reef resilience
   during high-temperature events.

AB Human activities in the Bahamas and other oceanic islands have damaged
   terrestrial ecosystems irreparably through the extinction of indigenous
   species. Tortoise and crocodile bones from Abaco Island in the Bahamas
   sampled for C-14-dating revealed a small overlap between the last
   occurrence of these large reptiles and early human settlement in the
   Bahamas. Before their extermination approximately 1,000 years ago, the
   dominant herbivore and carnivore on Abaco Island were the endemic
   Albury's Tortoise (Chelonoidis alburyorum) and the formerly widespread
   Cuban Crocodile (Crocodylus rhombifer). Stable isotope data from carbon
   (delta C-13) and nitrogen (delta N-15) in bone collagen from Late
   Holocene fossils suggest that these large reptiles were part of a
   terrestrial rather than marine or estuarine food web. Our proposal that
   Cuban Crocodiles were once the apex terrestrial predator in the Bahamas
   is supported by comparisons with published delta C-13 values for modern
   marine/estuarine crocodylians as compared to those of nonmarine
   reptilian and mammalian carnivores. For reptiles to occupy terrestrial
   trophic roles distinguishes Bahamian Islands from nearby Greater
   Antillean Islands (Cuba, Jamaica, Hispaniola, Puerto Rico) where endemic
   mammals represent the largest herbivores and carnivores in prehuman
   times. This distinction is even greater when compared with Late
   Quaternary mammals of prehuman vertebrate communities in neighboring
   North America.

   This symbiosis was 5 to 254 times more abundant than the commonly

   symbionts were not generally visible in transmitted light in living
   material. An additional 13 day-time series from Carrie Bow Cay, Belize
   found sustained high percentages of symbiotic Hemiaulus (average = 98%),
   suggesting these symbioses are persistent in tropical waters. Over 98%
   of the Hemiaulus spp. examined contained nitrogen-fixing symbionts.
   Additional observations on preserved material indicated the Hemiaulus

AB The Mesoamerican Reef, the second-largest barrier reef in the world, is
   located in the western Caribbean Sea off the coasts of Mexico, Belize,
   Guatemala, and Honduras. Particularly in the south, the surrounding
   watersheds are steep and the climate is extremely wet. With development
   and agricultural expansion, the potential for negative impacts to the
   reef from land-based runoff becomes high. We constructed annually
   resolved century-scale records of metal/calcium ratios in coral
   skeletons collected from four sites experiencing a gradient of
   land-based runoff. Our proxy data indicate that runoff onto the reef has
   increased relatively steadily over time at all sites, consistent with
   land use trends from historical records. Sediment supply to the reef is
   greater in the south, and these more exposed reefs will probably benefit
   most immediately from management that targets runoff reduction. However,
   because runoff at all sites is steadily increasing, even distal sites
   will benefit from watershed management. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All

AB Trinidad and Tobago lies within one of the world's most
   tourism-intensive regions, the Caribbean. Yet, unlike its neighbours, it
   has not relied heavily on income from travel and tourism since its
   economy is dominated by the energy sector. The energy sector is the
   mainstay of the economy contributing approximately 34.1% to the
   country's GDP, 85.5% to merchandise exports and 37.1% to Government
   revenues in 2004 (Ministry of Energy, 2006). The Government, in its aim
   for developed nation status by 2020, recognizes that the energy sector
   is unable to provide the sustainable jobs needed to achieve this. Thus,
   the Government's policy strategy, Vision 2020, identifies tourism as one
   of five (5) sectors that should be developed to contribute to the
   country's economic development.
   The tourism industry currently represents 13.8% of total Gross Domestic
   Product (GDP) in Trinidad and Tobago and is expected to increase its
   share by nearly three percentage points to 16.5% by 2015. It accounts
   for 16.7% of total employment, and this is forecasted to rise to 19.2%
   (WTTC, 2005). Several challenges are evident, that continue to limit the
   industry's full potential for growth in the country. It is against this
   background that this paper seeks to identify and analyse the strategies
   that can be adopted to maximize the contribution of the hospitality and
   tourism industry to economic development strategies proposed are a
   greater focus on local entrepreneurship; the re-orientation of the role
   of the local financial mechanisms in tourism development and; the
   development of competitive tourism investment incentives for potential
   investors in the hospitality and tourism industry. Copyright (C) 2008

AB Understanding patterns of connectivity in marine species is vital for
   the management and conservation of marine biodiversity. Here, the
   population genetic structure of a common and abundant tropical reef
   damselfish, Pomacentrus amboinensis, is reported. Using nine polymorphic
   microsatellite loci, the genetic structure at both small (i.e., around
   Lizard Island, Great Barrier Reef [GBR]) and large (GBR and Papua New
   Guinea [PNG]) spatial and temporal scales (2-1,600 km; 28 days- 6 years;
   n = 1,119) was analyzed. Temporal analyses found no evidence of genetic
   differentiation within or between Lizard Island recruitment pulses (R
   (ST) = -0.001, P = 0.788), or corresponding established adult
   populations separated by 6 years of sampling (R (ST) = 0.003, P =
   0.116). The spatial analysis revealed that P. amboinensis populations
   are largely panmictic on the GBR and eastern PNG (R (ST) = 0.001, P =
   0.913), the only genetic discontinuity being between Kimbe Bay to the
   north of PNG and all populations south of PNG (R (ST) = 0.077, P <
   0.0001). Despite assumed high levels of self-recruitment based on
   previous tagging studies (15-60%), data presented here indicate that
   enough recruits are dispersing to impede the evolution of genetic
   structure over distances as great as 1,600 kms in this species. Data
   therefore indicate that the temporal genetic stability recorded here is
   maintained by high levels of gene flow.

   selected pregnant women in Kingston and Manchester in Jamaica and St.
   Joseph in Trinidad & Tobago.
   The participants were interviewed on their fish intake. Neonatal
   anthropometric data were also recorded. The placental mercury
   concentrations ranged from 0.64 +/- 0.5 mu g/kg to 1.4 +/- 0.6 mu g/kg.
   The most significant associated factor for prenatal mercury exposure was
   maternal fish intake. Those pregnant women who regularly ate shark
   recorded the highest placenta mercury concentrations. Their neonates
   also had slightly smaller mean head circumference and lower birth
   weight.
   The mean placental mercury concentrations in this study were found to be
   lower than the literature values. Therefore it was difficult to detect
   any significant changes in neonatal anthropometry. This type of study
   can contribute to the extent of mercury exposure in the region. (C) 2017

AB The environmental impacts of biofuel production are one of the striking
   areas for policy debate in the academic and research arena since last
   few decades. This study empirically measured the environmental impacts
   of biofuel production in the panel of six largest regions of the World
   including East Asia & Pacific, Europe & Central Asia, Latin America &
   Caribbean, Middle East & North Africa (MENA), South Asia, and Sub
   Saharan African region, over the period of 1990-2013. The study used
   number of promising indicators for socioeconomic and environmental
   indicators coupled with the biofuels production that have a considerable
   impact on the climate change, agricultural land, water productivity,
   natural resources and biodiversity across the globe. The results show
   that production of biofuels exuberate the Hydrochlorofluorocarbons
   (HCFCs) in East Asia & Pacific region, Latin America & Caribbean region,
   South Asia, and Sub Saharan African region, while in Europe & Central
   Asia, biofuels production significantly lessen the amount of HCFCs in
   the region. The results of aggregated World panel data signify the

   during the study time period. The positive influence of biofuels
   production on agricultural land traced out in the East Asia & Pacific
   region, and MENA region, however, the result is inverted in the Latin

   water productivity in the East Asia & Pacific, South Asia, and Sub
   Saharan African region, while this result is evaporated in the Latin
   America & Caribbean, MENA, and Worlds aggregated region. The results are
   mixed in order to evaluate the impact of biofuels production on natural

   with the natural resource depletion. Finally, Biofuels production
   sustained the biodiversity in the East Asia & Pacific, Latin America &

AB Such is the ubiquity of environmentalism as a significant community
   experience throughout the world that most anthropologists will nowadays
   find themselves attending to the concerns their respondents have for the
   environments which surround and sustain them. In this article, we take
   stock of some of the issues addressed, and the achievements realized, by
   environmental anthropology to date. First, we emphasize that there is
   already a literature which stands as testament to the variety of
   environmental issues - water, whales and the weather, for instance - on
   which anthropologists have original insights to offer. Second, we argue
   that an important anthropological focus is on how ordinary people think
   and talk about their environments, especially when faced with external
   forces that have to be responded to in innovative and creative ways in
   order to be effective. It is not the view from above or below, but the
   view from within environments that matters most in local settings, which
   anthropologists have been concerned to unravel. Third, we emphasize that
   the Asia Pacific region constitutes an exceptionally rich field for
   anthropological research. Studies already carried out in places as
   diverse as Papua New Guinea, Tuvalu, the Marshall Islands, the
   Philippines, Indonesia, Chile and the Torres Strait make categorically
   clear that local and regional environmental concerns and conflicts are
   influenced by history, religion, Indigeneity, ethnicity, gender and
   other considerations that deserve critical anthropological enquiry. It
   is a crucial message that is endorsed and amplified by our fellow
   contributors in this special issue.

   eight species in three genera: Pentacheles Spence Bate, 1878, Polycheles
   Heller, 1862, and Stereomastis Spence Bate, 1888, is significant for
   although these species had been recorded in adjacent regions, prior to
   the BIOPAPUA expedition they have not been recorded from the Bismarck
   and western Solomon seas. The feasibility of seabed ore mining adds a
   sense of urgency to the exploration and analysis of the benthic
   biodiversity of a unique, barely explored region up for destructive

AB In developed countries, deaths from infectious diseases have decreased
   and those from chronic diseases have increased with modernization. In
   many developing countries which are undergoing rapid modernization,
   these changes have been accelerated, with marked variation from
   population to population. A typical pattern is observed in the risks of
   chronic diseases, like cardiovascular disorders and diabetic mellitus,
   which are closely associated with activity pattern and food intake. This
   paper reviews the relationship between modernization and health
   conditions in South Pacific countries, Papua New Guinea in particular,
   and discusses the significance of health and diseases in achieving
   ongoing sustainable development.

AB The reef islands formed on coral atolls are generally small, low, and
   flat, with elevations of only a few meters. These islands are thus
   highly vulnerable to elevated sea levels caused by extreme events and
   global warming. Such vulnerability was recently evidenced at Fongafale
   Islet, the capital of Tuvalu, when it flooded during accelerated spring
   high tides possibly related to sea level rise caused by global warming.
   Many factors, not only environmental but also economic and social,
   determine the vulnerability of an island to sea level rise. In this
   study, we used data spanning 108 yrs to reconstruct changes in
   topography, land use/cover, population, and the distribution of
   buildings at Fongafale Islet. The results indicate that the
   vulnerability of Fongafale Islet relates to its original landform
   characteristics: the central part of the island was formerly dominated
   by swampland that flooded at high tides. Fongafale Islet experienced
   greater population in-migration and centralization beginning in the
   1970s following the independence of Tuvalu and Kiribati. Migrants were
   also responding to declines in overseas mining operations and limited
   options for paid employment. As the population increased, construction
   took place in vulnerable swampland areas. Our results clearly
   demonstrate that examinations of global environmental issues should
   focus on characteristics specific to the region of interest. These
   characteristics should be specified using historical reconstruction to
   understand and address the vulnerability of an area to global
   environmental changes. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V All rights reserved.

AB Community assemblages of live and dead benthic foraminifera from
   Kiritimati (Christmas) Island, Kiribati, were used to investigate
   changes in nutrification before and after human occupation. Benthic
   foraminiferal assemblages have previously been shown to have strong
   empirical relationships with water quality: mixotrophic,
   symbiont-bearing foraminifera dominate in clear, nutrient-poor waters,
   while heterotrophic and/or opportunistic foraminifera are more prevalent
   in polluted or nutrified waters. After human occupation, the proportion
   of mixotrophic taxa decreased significantly at all sites on Kiritimati
   with the largest decreases observed at sites with the highest fishing
   pressure. These changes in the benthic foraminiferal assemblage indicate
   that nutrification has occurred on Kiritimati over the scale of decades,
   possibly due to changes in trophic structure and nutrient cycling caused
   by fishing.

AB Leptospirosis is a global zoonosis caused by pathogenic spirochetes
   classified within the genus Leptospira. Leptospires live in the proximal
   renal tubules of reservoir or chronic carrier animals, and are shed in
   the urine. Naive animals acquire infection either when they come in
   direct contact with a reservoir or infected animals or by exposure to
   environmental surface water or soil that is contaminated with their
   urine. In this study, urine samples from a herd of donkeys on the
   Caribbean island of St. Kitts were screened using a TaqMan-based
   real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) targeting a
   pathogen-specific leptospiral gene, lipl32. Out of 124 clinically normal
   donkeys, 22 (18%) tested positive for leptospiral DNA in their urine.
   Water samples from two water troughs used by the donkeys were also
   tested, but were found to be free from leptospiral contamination.
   Detection of leptospiral DNA in the urine of clinically healthy donkeys
   may point to a role that these animals play in the maintenance of the
   bacteria on St. Kitts.

AB The goal of biodiversity hotspots is to identify regions around the
   world where conservation priorities should be focused. We undertake a
   geographic information system and remote sensing analysis to identify
   the rarest and least protected forests in biodiversity hotspots. World
   Wildlife Fund ecoregions with terrestrial forest were subset from 34
   biodiversity hotspots and forest cover calculated from GlobCover data at
   a 300 m pixel resolution. There were 276 ecoregions in 32 biodiversity
   hotspots classified as containing terrestrial forests. When the first
   quartile of forest ecoregions was subset based on smallest extent of
   forest cover in protected areas, there were 69 rare forests identified
   within 20 biodiversity hotspots. Most rare forest ecoregions (45)
   occurred on islands or island archipelagos and 47 rare forest ecoregions
   contained less than 10 % forest cover in protected areas. San F,lix-San
   Ambrosio Islands Temperate Forests, Tubuai Tropical Moist Forests,
   Maldives-Lakshadweep-Chagos Archipelago Tropical Moist Forests, and Yap
   Tropical Dry Forests were identified as the least protected and possibly
   most vulnerable forests within biodiversity hotspots. These ecoregions
   cover less than 500 km(2), forest cover is less than 50 km(2), and there
   are no protected areas. There is a need to update classifications and
   boundaries of protected areas, insure that islands are included in
   global land cover datasets, and identify levels of endemism and
   endangerment within forest ecoregions. This should improve our ability
   to compare, prioritize, and monitor forests in biodiversity hotspots.

   combined 21,184 m of transect, ranging from sandy lower island-slope to
   rocky upper island-slope habitat. Debris densities differed
   significantly with depth. Highest debris accumulation (0.459 items 100
   m(-2) or 4590 items per km(2)) occurred at depths of 300-600 m on more
   shallow-sloping (20-30 degrees) sand and silt bottoms. The overall
   average debris density was 0.27 objects per 100 m(2) (or 2700 items per
   km(2)), which is an order of magnitude higher than most other deepwater
   debris studies. What we describe may be representative for other small,

AB Two new Ethelia (Etheliaceae, Rhodophyta) species are described from
   Puerto Rico and a third from the Bahamas. None were found at both
   locations. All three differ from previously described Ethelia species in
   possessing ventral rhizoids as well as possessing variably extensive
   ventral parenchymatous outgrowths. Ethelia crassa has been collected at
   a shallow-water, high wave energy site in southwestern Puerto Rico and
   at an exposed site at Mona Island. The species forms highly conspicuous
   orange encrustations that are thicker than any other Ethelia species.
   Ethelia crassa also possesses prominent mesothallial vein cells. A
   second Puerto Rican species, Ethelia magnieni, restricted to habitats
   greater than 60 m depth, also forms thick encrustations and is
   characterized by its very small cortical filaments, 3.0 mu m in
   diameter. The third, Ethelia excrescens, is from deep-water Bahamian
   habitats and possesses dorsal surface projections as well as extensive
   parenchymatous ventral outgrowths. SSU DNA sequencing performed on E.
   magnieni and E. crassa confirmed their placement in the genus as well
   their status as independent species.

AB Objective. To identify, assess, and compare existing policies on
   noncommunicable diseases (NCDs) in the Caribbean, gaps in policy
   responses, and the factors influencing successful policy development and
   implementation following the Port of Spain Declaration of 2007.
   Specifically, to examine policies that target the upstream determinants
   of two NCD risk factors-unhealthy diets and physical inactivity.
   Methods. A total of 76 semi-structured interviews with 80 relevant
   stakeholders in government, the private sector, and civil society were
   complemented by policy document analysis. Interviews were analyzed
   pragmatically, framed by the CARICOM government commitments, the WHO NCD
   Action Plan, a Multiple Streams framework approach, and realist
   evaluation ideas.
   Results. The most widely-reported policy successes involved health
   promotion activities (e.g., school meal programs) that leveraged
   multisectoral collaboration among government ministries, such as Health,
   Education, and Agriculture. large policy gaps still exist around
   creating legislative, physical, and social environments to support
   healthy eating and physical activity at the population level.
   Multisectoral NCD commissions successfully reached across sectors, but
   had limited influence on policy development. Different policy levels
   emerged with national-level policies considered a lengthy process, while
   "On-the-ground" programming was considered faster to implement than
   national policies. External barriers included a reliance on food imports
   enabled by international trade agreements limited availability, quality,
   and affordability of healthyfrods. International pushback limited
   legislation to reduce food imports and the absence of an
   international/regional framework, similar to the Framework Convention on
   Tobacco Control, further impedes efforts.
   Conclusions. Regional collaboration and political support across sectors
   are essential to accelerating the pace of action to support healthy
   eating and active living environments. Policy "blueprints" could
   accelerate the process of development. Regional "NCD champions" could
   spearhead such responses and approaches.

AB This work presents iron isotope data in the western equatorial Pacific.
   Marine aerosols and top core margin sediments display a slightly heavy
   Fe isotopic composition (Fe-56) of 0.330.11 (2SD) and 0.140.07,
   respectively. Samples reflecting the influence of Papua New Guinea
   runoff (Sepik River and Rabaul volcano water) are characterized by
   crustal values. In seawater, Fe is mainly supplied in the particulate
   form and is found with a Fe-56 between -0.49 and 0.34 +/- 0.07 parts per
   thousand. The particulate Fe seems to be brought mainly by runoff and
   transported across continental shelves and slopes. Aerosols are
   suspected to enrich the surface Vitiaz Strait waters, while hydrothermal
   activity likely enriched New Ireland waters. Dissolved Fe isotopic
   ratios are found between -0.03 and 0.53 +/- 0.07 parts per thousand.
   They are almost systematically heavier than the corresponding
   particulate Fe, and the difference between the signature of both phases
   is similar for most samples with Fe-56(DFe-PFe)=+0.27 +/- 0.25 parts per
   thousand (2SD). This is interpreted as an equilibrium isotopic
   fractionation revealing exchange fluxes between both phases. The
   dissolved phase being heavier than the particles suggests that the
   exchanges result in a net nonreductive release of dissolved Fe. This
   process seems to be locally significantly more intense than Fe reductive
   dissolution documented along reducing margins. It may therefore
   constitute a very significant iron source to the ocean, thereby
   influencing the actual estimation of the iron residence time and sinks.
   The underlying processes could also apply to other elements.

AB Reef fish assemblages in the Caribbean are under increasing pressure
   from human activities. Inadequate enforcement of legislation coupled
   with unreliable and data-poor landings in Tobago have led to the
   unregulated exploitation of reef fish for decades. This study addresses
   the lack of data on major reefs. Visual observations of fish fauna were
   conducted from November 2011-May 2013 at open access reef sites
   (Speyside, Charlotteville, Culloden, Arnos Vale, Mt. Irvine, La Guira,
   Kilgwyn, Plymouth and Black Rock) and one protected area (Buccoo Reef
   Marine Park). Belt transects surveys were used to determine fish
   density, species diversity and abundance at the 10-15m depth contour.
   Fish sizes were converted to biomass using the length-weight
   relationship of fish W=aL(b). Most fish assemblages were dominated by
   small herbivores (<15cm), in particular Pomacentridae and Scaridae. Few
   large predators (>40cm) e.g. Serranidae, were noted, which is indicative
   of fishing pressure. MDS ordination identified three fish assemblages:
   i) northeastern, ii) southwestern and iii) intermediate. The
   northwestern cluster (Speyside and Charlotteville) were most
   representative of reef fish assemblages across the entire island, and
   exhibited the highest species richness, diversity and biomass. However,
   the southwestern cluster the highest numerical abundance. The marine
   protected area contained higher fish biomass, abundance, diversity and
   richness, but it was only representative of reef fish assemblages on the
   southwest of the island and not the entire Tobago. Research on the reef
   fishery, particularly spear fishing, is recommended to determine impact.

AB Contemporary West Indian biodiversity has been shaped by two millennia
   of non-native species introductions. Understanding the dynamics of this
   process and its legacy across extended temporal and spatial scales
   requires accurate knowledge of introduction timing and the species
   involved. Richard Ligon's 17th century account and celebrated map of
   early colonial Barbados records the translocation of several Old World
   species to the island in the post-contact era, including pigs (Sus
   scrofa) believed to have been released by passing sailors the century
   prior. Here we challenge this long-accepted historical narrative,
   presenting evidence that Ligon's "pigs" were in fact peccaries, a New
   World continental mammal often confused with wild boars. We document the
   first recorded instance of non-native peccary (Tayassuidae) on Barbados
   based on a securely identified mandibular specimen from a historic
   archaeological context. Results of specimen Sr-87/Sr-86 and AMS
   radiocarbon assays, along with newly reported data from Sr isotope
   environmental analyses, indicate a local origin dating to AD
   1645-1670/1780-1800. These data support the presence of living peccary
   on Barbados some time during the first 175 years of English settlement,
   which, based on review of historical and archaeological data, most
   likely arises from 16th century peccary introduction from the
   Guianas/Trinidad by the Spanish or Portuguese. We argue dimorphic
   representations of "pigs" on Ligon's map reflect the co-occurrence of
   peccary and European domestic swine on historic Barbados. Our findings
   overturn conventional history and provide greater taxonomic and
   chronological resolution for Caribbean bioinvasion studies, helping to
   refine our understanding of potential ecological impacts. In addition,
   the new bioavailable 87Sr/86Sr data for Barbados reported here advance
   current efforts toward mapping the Caribbean Sr isoscape.

AB Near the western boundary of the tropical North Atlantic, where the
   North Brazil Current (NBC) retroflects into the North Equatorial
   Countercurrent, large anticyclonic rings are shed. After separating from
   the retroflection region, the so-called NBC rings travel northwestward
   along the Brazilian coast, until they reach the island chain of the
   Lesser Antilles and disintegrate. These rings contribute substantially
   to the upper limb return flow of the Atlantic Meridional Overturning
   Circulation by carrying South Atlantic Water into the northern
   subtropical gyre. Their relevance for the northward transport of South
   Atlantic Water depends on the frequency of their generation as well as
   on their horizontal and vertical structure. The ring shedding and
   propagation and the complex interaction of the rings with the Lesser
   Antilles are investigated in the 1/12 degrees Family of Linked Atlantic
   Model Experiments (FLAME) model. The ring properties simulated in FLAME
   reach the upper limit of the observed rings in diameter and agree with
   recent observations on seasonal variability, which indicates a maximum
   shedding during the first half of the year. When the rings reach the
   shallow topography of the Lesser Antilles, they are trapped by the
   island triangle of St. Lucia, Barbados and Tobago and interact with the
   island chain. The model provides a resolution that is capable of
   resolving the complex topographic conditions at the islands and
   illuminates various possible fates for the water contained in the rings.
   It also reproduces laboratory experiments that indicate that both
   cyclones and anticyclones are formed after a ring passes through a
   topographic gap. Trajectories of artificial floats, which were inserted
   into the modeled velocity field, are used to investigate the pathways of
   the ring cores and their fate after they encounter the Lesser Antilles.
   The majority of the floats entered the Caribbean, while the northward
   Atlantic pathway was found to be of minor importance. No prominent
   pathway was found east of Barbados, where a ring could avoid the
   interaction with the islands and migrate toward the northern Lesser
   Antilles undisturbed.

AB Smallholder farming systems in Papua New Guinea are characterised by an
   integrated set of cash cropping and subsistence food cropping
   activities. In the Highlands provinces, the subsistence food crop
   sub-system is dominated by sweet potato production. Coffee dominates the
   cash cropping sub-system, but a limited number of food crops are also
   grown for cash sale. The dynamics between sub-systems can influence the
   scope for complementarity between, and technical efficiency of, their
   operations, especially in light of the seasonality of demand for
   household labour and management inputs within the farming system. A
   crucial element of these dynamic processes is diversification into
   commercial agricultural production, which can influence factor
   productivity and the efficiency of crop production where smallholders
   maintain a strong production base in subsistence foods.
   In this study we use survey data from households engaged in coffee and
   food crop production in the Benabena district of Eastern Highlands
   Province to derive technical efficiency indices for each household over
   two years. A stochastic input distance function approach is used to
   establish whether diversification economies exist and whether
   specialisation in coffee, subsistence food or cash food production
   significantly influences technical efficiency on the sampled
   smallholdings.
   Diversification economics are weakly evident between subsistence food
   production and both coffee and cash food production, but diseconomies of
   diversification are discerned between coffee and cash food production. A
   number of factors are tested for their effects on technical efficiency.
   Significant technical efficiency gains are made from diversification
   among broad cropping enterprises. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights

AB The taxonomy of the freshwater shrimps Caridina (Atyidae) is very
   complex and confused mostly because the morphological characters that
   have traditionally been used for species delimitation and identification
   are highly plastic. There is thus a need for an integrative approach to
   their taxonomy. In total, 42 specimens belonging to either Caridina
   buehleri Roux, 1934 or Caridina gueryi Marquet, Keith & Kalfatak, 2009
   were examined. We combined here morphological data from 12 specimens
   from the whole distributional range of the species, including type
   specimens with 16S mtDNA analyses from seven freshly sampled specimens,
   to verify the specific status of Caridina buehleri from Papua
   New-Guinea, Central Sulawesi, Western Samoa and the Solomon Islands, and
   C. gueryi from Vanuatu. The comparison of 24 morphological characters
   showed that morphological variations of character traits between C.
   gueryi and C. buehleri are widely overlapping and that no morphological
   feature can effectively split specimens into two clear groups. Molecular
   characters corroborated these results, as specimens from both groups
   were only separated by a 2% p-distance, a genetic distance that is
   coherent with their potentially high dispersal abilities. We thus
   consider C. gueryi as a junior synonym of C. buehleri. Finally, C.
   buehleri is characterised mainly by a styliform and characteristically
   indented rostrum and a long stylocerite. Detailed re-descriptions of the
   type specimens of C. buehleri and C. gueryi are given, as well as their
   geographical and ecological distribution.

   with Asia and 6% with both Australia and Asia. The high proportion of
   endemic species was principally due to species radiation in four genera:
   Australiobates, Albia, Corticacarus and Arrenurus. Webers line was the
   most likely line of discontinuity between the Asian and Australasian
   water mite faunas.

AB Killer whales ( Orcinus orca) have a cosmopolitan distribution, yet
   little is known about populations that inhabit tropical waters. We
   compiled 34 sightings of killer whales in the Bahamas, recorded from
   1913 to 2011. Group sizes were generally small (mean = 4.2, range =
   1-12, SD = 2.6). Thirteen sightings were documented with photographs
   and/or video of sufficient quality to allow individual
   photo-identification analysis. Of the 45 whales photographed, 14 unique
   individual killer whales were identified, eight of which were re-sighted
   between two and nine times. An adult female (Oo6) and a now-adult male
   (Oo4), were first seen together in 1995, and have been re-sighted
   together eight times over a 16-yr period. To date, killer whales in the
   Bahamas have only been observed preying on marine mammals, including
   Atlantic spotted dolphin (Stenella frontalis), Fraser's dolphin
   (Lagenodelphis hosei), pygmy sperm whale (Kogia breviceps) and dwarf
   sperm whale (Kogia sima), all of which are previously unrecorded prey
   species for Orcinus orca.

AB A new species of the Montastraea "annularis" species complex is herein
   described from Pleistocene coral reefs of the Caribbean Sea. The
   species, Montastraea nancyi n. sp., had a broad geographic distribution
   at mainly insular sites 125 Ka. It has a fossil record extending from
   >600 Ka (thousand years) to 82 Ka, both first and last occurrences
   exclusively on the island of Barbados. It also had a broad environmental
   tolerance, occurring in fringing, windward back-reef and reef-crest,
   leeward reef-crest, and lagoonal patch-reef environments. In every
   habitat in which it lived, there are examples that it either dominated
   the coral fauna or shared dominance with Acropora palmata, a dominant
   shallow water coral in high-energy Pleistocene and modem reefs. The
   extinction of Montastraea nancyi resulted in evolutionary and ecological
   change in surviving members of the M. "annularis" species complex.

AB A taxonomic and biogeographic analysis was made of populations of two
   Cafius species from the coasts of the Caribbean, Gulf of Mexico, and
   Atlantic North America. Cafius bilineatus (Erichson), whose type
   locality is St. John's, Antigua is a synonym of C. bistriatus
   (Erichson), whose type locality is Long Island, New York [USA]. Two
   subspecies of C. bistriatus are recognized: C. b. bistriatus [new
   status] from the Caribbean, Gulf of Mexico, and Atlantic North America,
   and C. b. fulgens Frank [new subspecies] from the coasts of the Gulf of
   California, Baja California, and the Salton Sea. The typical subspecies
   has two disjunct populations: a northern population from Virginia
   northwards at least to the Gulf of St. Lawrence, and a southern
   population in the Caribbean, the southern part of the Gulf of Mexico,
   and lower peninsular Florida. The principal habitat of C. bistriatus is
   stranded macrophytic algae. Distribution of this species appears to be
   determined by the distribution of such algae, for they form the basal
   material of the food chain in whch Cafius adults and larvae exist as
   predators. Cafius rufifrons Bierig, whose type locality is Havana, Cuba,
   is restricted to part of Cuba and extreme southern Florida: adults
   differ in color and structure from those of C. bistriatus and are of
   smaller average size. Cafius rufifrons and C. bistriatus occur in the
   same habitats in extreme southern Florida and the reason for the very
   restricted  distribution of C. rufifrons is not clear.

   have been carried out in this remote area of Western New Guinea. Working
   in collaboration with local people we made 15 plots, 10 in primary
   forest, 3 in secondary forest and 2 in gardens. A total of 487
   morpho-species were distinguished, of which 32 % (156) did not match any
   herbarium specimens or published reference. Tree densities (598 +/-
   136/ha) are similar to lowland forests elsewhere, but mean stem sizes
   (22 +/- 1 cm dbh and 21 +/- 2 m height for trees over 10 cm dbh) appear
   small. Numbers of tree species per plot (22 +/- 4, of 40 stems recorded)
   are unremarkable, but levels of endemism are potentially high with many
   of the unidentified species being rare (seldom collected) or
   undescribed. This is the first quantitative description of vegetation in
   Kwerba, Foja and Mamberamo, and joins only a handful of such studies in
   Papua. Additional botanical and ecological survey effort is greatly
   needed in Mamberamo, and in New Guinea generally.

AB In recent years, private companies have acquired long-term leasehold
   titles to more than five million hectares of what was formerly customary
   land in Papua New Guinea (PNG), but hardly any of this land has been
   devoted to production of the four green commodities in which PNG might
   have some comparative advantage - sustainable palm oil, bio-ethanol,
   biodiversity and carbon credits. Nearly all of it is dedicated to
   so-called 'agro forestry' projects that appear to be short-term salvage
   logging projects justified by the promise of a purely virtual form of
   large-scale agricultural production. I argue that the 'agro foresters'
   have been more successful than the green investors because of a set of
   political and institutional factors that distinguish PNG from many of
   the other countries where land grabbing has become the order of the day.

AB Deep-sea fisheries provide an important source of protein to Pacific
   Island countries and territories that are highly dependent on fish for
   food security. However, spatial management of these deep-sea habitats is
   hindered by insufficient data. We developed species distribution models
   using spatially limited presence data for the main harvested species in
   the Western Central Pacific Ocean. We used bathymetric and water
   temperature data to develop presence-only species distribution models
   for the commercially exploited deep-sea snappers Etelis Cuvier 1828,
   Pristipomoides Valenciennes 1830, and Aphareus Cuvier 1830. We evaluated
   the performance of four different algorithms (CTA, GLM, MARS, and
   MAXENT) within the BIOMOD framework to obtain an ensemble of predicted
   distributions. We projected these predictions across the Western Central
   Pacific Ocean to produce maps of potential deep-sea snapper
   distributions in 32 countries and territories. Depth was consistently
   the best predictor of presence for all species groups across all models.
   Bathymetric slope was consistently the poorest predictor. Temperature at
   depth was a good predictor of presence for GLM only. Model precision was
   highest for MAXENT and CTA. There were strong regional patterns in
   predicted distribution of suitable habitat, with the largest areas of
   suitable habitat (> 35% of the Exclusive Economic Zone) predicted in
   seven South Pacific countries and territories (Fiji, Matthew & Hunter,
   Nauru, New Caledonia, Tonga, Vanuatu and Wallis & Futuna). Predicted
   habitat also varied among species, with the proportion of predicted
   habitat highest for Aphareus and lowest for Etelis. Despite data
   paucity, the relationship between deep-sea snapper presence and their
   environments was sufficiently strong to predict their distribution
   across a large area of the Pacific Ocean. Our results therefore provide
   a strong baseline for designing monitoring programs that balance
   resource exploitation and conservation planning, and for predicting
   future distributions of deep-sea snappers.

AB Traditional agricultural land use systems in the humid tropics of the
   Southwest Pacific are, as elsewhere, affected by globalization
   processes. This paper analyzes the directions of change in the land use
   system of Bellona, a small outer island in the Solomon Islands. We focus
   on the human-environmental interaction that shapes land use patterns and
   practices in the context of theoretical lines of thought concerning
   intensification of agricultural systems in the tropics. Aerial
   photography from 1966 and satellite imagery from 2006 in conjunction
   with studies from the 1960s and a contemporary household survey reveal
   only minor changes in the agricultural system. Land use and land cover
   dynamics are related to agricultural strategies, demographic factors,
   institutional actors as well as biophysical drivers or constraints.
   Local agricultural production still contributes significantly to local
   subsistence but imported food has also become a major food source.
   Hence, land use has become partially disconnected from the local
   population pressure and therefore remains relatively stable while the
   larger livelihood portfolio has undergone significant diversification.
   At present, the agricultural system is a supplement to a range of
   strategies supporting the increasing number of people on the island.
   This explains why land use patterns continue relatively unchanged while
   livelihood and food supply strategies have changed.

AB Unlike many of the archipelagic stations comprising the Pacific-Asia
   Biodiversity Transect (PABITRA) network, the flora of Papua New Guinea
   (PNG) is exceedingly speciose and in a remarkable state of preservation.
   Sites targeted for PABITRA action in PNG are unexplored or have only
   very limited botanical documentation. Vegetation sampling under such a
   combination of circumstances is highly problematic, particularly with
   respect to identification of sterile material from plot enumerations.
   The country team has thus pursued a study plan based on intensive
   collection and taxonomic evaluation, conducted prior to establishment of
   transects. Sterile vouchers can be determined to an acceptable level of
   confidence when matched to fertile specimens obtained from comprehensive
   exploration. Substantial numbers of new taxa are being revealed by the
   PABITRA assessments as a collateral benefit of this procedure. The
   following narrative summarizes the discoveries which have resulted from
   ongoing investigations in poorly known environments, and discusses some
   implications for future floristic work in Papuasia.

AB There is an urgent need to develop simple indicators of fishing effects
   for the implementation of ecosystem-based fisheries management in the
   Caribbean. In this study, we compare the ability of three simple metrics
   (average individual fish weight, fish density, and fish biomass) derived
   from the parrotfish assemblage and from an assemblage of highly valued
   commercial fish species to track changes in fishing pressure at spatial
   scales relevant to small Caribbean islands. Between June and August
   2011, we conducted five consecutive visual fish surveys at six reefs <=
   10 km apart along the west coast of Barbados, representing a spatial
   gradient in fishing pressure. We used these data to identify the fish
   metrics most strongly correlated with fishing pressure and describe
   their functional relationship with fishing pressure. Overall, average
   individual parrotfish weight and biomass and density of commercial fish
   species were the metrics most strongly correlated with fishing pressure,
   although for the latter two, such correlations depended on the range of
   fish body sizes analyzed. Fishing pressure accounted for most of the
   variability in all correlated fish metrics (R-adj(2) >= 0.75). However,
   functional relationships with fishing pressure differed qualitatively
   between metrics. In particular, average individual parrotfish weight was
   the metric most sensitive to incremental changes in fishing pressure.
   Overall, our study highlights that assemblage-level average individual
   parrotfish weight deserves a place in the toolbox of Caribbean reef
   managers as a simple indicator of both fishing effects on parrotfish
   assemblages and overall fishing pressure on the reef fish community.

   Sea has not been studied. Based on altimetry data (1993-2009) and the
   MERCATOR three-dimensional assimilation model (2007-2009), the CCC was
   observed flowing similar to 1000 km from the eastern Yucatan Channel to
   Jamaica and to have a width of similar to 450 km. Off southern Cuba, the
   mean velocity was 0.20 m s(-1) at the surface and 0.05 m s(-1) at 1000 m
   depth. The CCC transported similar to 3.5 Sv when it passed through the
   Yucatan Channel towards the Caribbean Sea, where similar to 04.6 Sv was
   recorded south of Cuba. During its annual cycle, the CCC weakened from
   December to February (0-250 m) and in the summer its magnitude
   intensified slightly, reaching 0.35 m s(-1) in August, due to the
   increase in water temperature of the Atlantic warm pool. Consequently,
   the sea level rose in the center of the Yucatan Basin and the pressure
   gradient increased along the Cuban coast, producing an increase in zonal
   velocity (0.1 m s(-1)) and transport (2-3 Sv; r = 0.90). Its connection
   to the Caribbean current system demonstrated the importance of its
   study.

AB Inland blue holes of the Bahamas are anchialine ecosystems with distinct
   fresh and salt water layers, and anoxic or microoxic conditions at
   depth. Scientific cave diving and geomicrobiology exploration of blue
   holes are providing a first glimpse of the geochemistry and microbial
   life in these vertically stratified karst features. We hypothesized that
   two geographically adjacent, sunlit blue holes on Abaco Island would
   have comparable biogeochemistry and microbial life. Water samples were
   analyzed using in situ multiparameter dataloggers and field and
   laboratory tests, and diver-retrieved microbial samples were analyzed
   using nucleic acid analysis. Microbial 16S rRNA genes were dominated by
   members of the anoxygenic phototroph clade Chlorobi, with smaller
   numbers of Deltaproteobacteria, in both blue holes. However, spatial
   distributions of microbial biomass and species present within these
   major clades were significantly different. We also found that
   differences in the intensity of solar insolation, terrestrial and marine
   inputs, water residence time, depth to the halo/chemocline, and cave
   passage geometry strongly influence geochemical changes with depth. The
   biogeochemical diversity of inland blue holes in the Bahamas make them
   valuable as natural laboratories, repositories of microbial diversity,
   and analogs for stratified and sulfidic oceans present early in Earth's
   history.

AB Objectives: To assess prenatal exposures and potential health outcomes
   to environmental toxicants such as persistent organic pollutants (POPs),
   commonly used pesticides, and two heavy metals - mercury (Hg) and lead
   (Pb) - in 10 Caribbean countries.
   Subjects and Methods: For each participating Caribbean island,
   approximately 50 maternal blood and urine samples were collected and
   analysed for POPs such as polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and
   polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), other common classes of
   pesticides used in the Caribbean such as organophosphates (OP),
   carbamates, chlorophenols and pyrethroids, and for Hg and Pb. Data
   obtained from the participating countries were compared with those from
   the United States of America and Canada.
   Results: A total of 438 samples were analysed from 10 Caribbean
   countries. Persistent organic pollutants were detected in almost all
   samples, however, these were generally low compared with comparable
   North American results. Evidence of exposure to PBDEs, OPs, carbamates
   and chlorophenols was also established. Caribbean pyrethroid
   concentrations were generally much higher than those recorded for North
   American women. Caribbean Pb maternal blood levels were generally lower
   than in North America, whereas Hg blood levels were two to three times
   higher. In almost all of the samples taken in this study, exposures to
   multiple chemicals were taking place at the same time.
   Conclusion: This first Caribbean-wide exploratory biomonitoring study on
   the concentrations of several toxicants in maternal samples taken from
   10 Caribbean countries clearly reinforces the need for Caribbean primary
   care physicians and other public health officials to encourage their
   patients, and in particular pregnant women, to reduce their exposures to
   these environmental contaminants as far as it is feasible to do so.

AB Thermocline waters of the tropical southwest Pacific can be traced back
   to the center of the South Pacific basin and have a potential influence
   on equatorial surface conditions and on the characteristics of the El
   Nino Southern Oscillation on decadal timescales. The Solomon Sea is
   traversed by this influential flow, and therefore is an optimal place
   for exploring this oceanic connection to the equator. From a
   high-resolution hydrographic survey at which we applied an inverse box
   model, we describe the main pathways at the entrance of the Solomon Sea,
   and more particularly the extremely sharp bend of the western boundary
   current around the south-east tip of Papua New Guinea. Of the 30 Sv
   subtropical waters transported into the Coral Sea from the east, above
   1300 m, 29 +/- 5 Sv makes its way through the Solomon Sea with a large
   part transported in a boundary current, at the entrance of the Solomon
   Sea. Around the south-east tip of Papua New Guinea, the Gulf of Papua
   Current turns abruptly to the north, in a very sharp bend as it merges
   into the New Guinea Coastal Undercurrent, on its way, toward the
   equator. The warm currents transport large amounts of internal energy,
   with a total of 1.0 +/- 0.3 10(15)W entering the Solomon Sea from the
   south. Citation: Gasparin, F., A. Ganachaud, C. Maes, F. Marin, and G.

AB Mesophotic coral reefs (30-150 m) have been assumed to be physically and
   biologically connected to their shallow-water counterparts, and thus may
   serve as refugia for important taxonomic groups such as corals, sponges,
   and fish. The recent invasion of the Indo-Pacific lionfish (Pterois
   volitans) onto shallow reefs of the Caribbean and Bahamas has had
   significant, negative, effects on shallow coral reef fish populations.
   In the Bahamas, lionfish have extended their habitat range into
   mesophotic depths down to 91 m where they have reduced the diversity of
   several important fish guilds, including herbivores. A phase shift to an
   algal dominated (> 50% benthic cover) community occurred simultaneously
   with the loss of herbivores to a depth of 61 m and caused a significant
   decline in corals and sponges at mesophotic depths. The effects of this
   invasive lionfish on mesophotic coral reefs and the subsequent changes
   in benthic community structure could not be explained by coral
   bleaching, overfishing, hurricanes, or disease independently or in
   combination. The significant ecological effects of the lionfish invasion
   into mesophotic depths of coral reefs casts doubt on whether these
   communities have the resilience to recover themselves or contribute to
   the recovery of their shallow water counterparts as refugia for key
   coral reef taxa.

   Methods and procedures A mixed sampling method was used to obtain a
   representative sample and trained interviewers administered 24-h dietary
   recalls. Portion sizes were assessed and the most frequently reported
   foods were tabulated.
   Main outcomes and results Results are from 155 men and 169 women aged
   21--64 years. The most frequently reported food items were: full-cream
   milk (64%), rice (61%), and sweetened fruit drinks (50%). Carbonated
   drinks were consumed by 28%. The most frequently consumed fruits were
   banana (23%) and citrus (22%); < 20% consumed a vegetable food item. The
   final QFFQ contains 146 items: 19 breads/cakes/cereals; seven
   rice/pastas/noodles; 12 dairy; 26 meats/poultry/fish/soy products; 15
   fruits; 34 vegetables; six legumes; 11 other; 12 drinks; four alcoholic
   drinks.
   Conclusions A list of commonly consumed foods in Trinidad and Tobago was
   obtained and a draft QFFQ was prepared.

AB Limited financial resources for conservation and growing environmental
   problems make it vital to base conservation on sound scientific
   evidence. Small islands hold a disproportionately large amount of the
   worlds threatened biodiversity but it is among the least
   well-documented. This paper reports on the most extensive collation and
   synthesis of biodiversity data to date for the 14 United Kingdom
   Overseas Territories (UKOTs). A process of literature review and
   consultation produced 65,259 species records, including 32,216 native
   species of which 1549 were endemic to a single UKOT. The extent of
   knowledge of species occurrence varied both between islands and
   taxonomic groups. It was higher for vertebrates and vascular plants than
   small bodied invertebrates and non-vascular and for non-Caribbean
   compared to Caribbean islands, a difference that largely reflects
   knowledge of invertebrates. Global Red List assessments exist for 2606
   species and document 111 of endemic species, 75 % of those assessed, and
   291, 12 % of non-endemics, as globally threatened. Using the data to
   estimate true species richness suggests a further 70,000 native species,
   including 1800 single island endemics, remain to be documented
   suggesting the UKOTs as a whole may support over 100,000 native species
   including 3300 single island endemics.

   in the 80's by Dieter Rockel is discussed. The latter species is also
   known from deeper water throughout the Philippines but has a wider
   Indo-Pacific distribution, a different shell morphology, animal body
   color and, based on protoconch information, a shorter period of larval
   development. A closer phylogenetic relationship of the new species with

AB The Caribbean spiny lobster, Panulirus argus, is one of the most
   valuable fisheries commodities in the Central American region, directly
   employing 50,000 people and generating >US$450 million per year [1].
   This industry is particularly important to small island states such as
   The Bahamas, which exports more lobster than any other country in the
   region [1]. Several factors contribute to this disproportionally high
   productivity, principally the extensive shallow-water banks covered in
   seagrass meadows [2], where fishermen deploy artificial shelters for the
   lobsters to supplement scarce reef habitat [3]. The surrounding seabed
   communities are dominated by lucinid bivalve mollusks that live among
   the seagrass root system [4, 5]. These clams host chemoautotrophic
   bacterial symbionts in their gills that synthesize organic matter using
   reduced sulfur compounds, providing nutrition to their hosts [6]. Recent
   studies have highlighted the important role of the lucinid clam
   symbiosis in maintaining the health and productivity of seagrass
   ecosystems [7, 8], but their biomass also represents a potentially
   abundant, but as yet unquantified, food source to benthic predators [9].
   Here we undertake the first analysis of Caribbean spiny lobster diet
   using a stable isotope approach (carbon, nitrogen, and sulfur) and show
   that a significant portion of their food (similar to 20% on average) is
   obtained from chemosynthetic primary production in the form of lucinid
   clams. This nutritional pathway was previously unrecognized in the spiny
   lobster's diet, and these results are the first empirical evidence that
   chemosynthetic primary production contributes to the productivity of
   commercial fisheries stocks.

AB Evidence-based obesity reduction programs in the Pacific are scarce to
   nonexistent. Using a community-based participatory research model (CBPR)
   we developed a collaboration between our university and a small Pacific
   Island nation. We established an advisory council of local stakeholders
   and then conducted an extensive needs assessment with youth, parents,
   professionals, and lay public. Only 9% of participants had tried a
   weight loss program. There was a strong tendency to engage in
   binge-eating cycles; difficulty eating healthy during frequent community
   celebrations with few healthy food options available in general; and
   limited traditions that involved physical activity. Participants wanted
   to learn how to increase their physical activity, make healthier food
   choices, and learn to reward themselves for healthy behaviors. Diets
   were most frequently high in energy or protein foods, followed by
   starch, sugary and fried foods; they ate vegetables and fruits least
   often. Together, our team then created the culturally relevant Fit Kit
   Palau (R). We highlight lessons learned including how to determine
   partnerships; manage multiple cultural and geographic barriers; build
   capacity; and balance program fidelity with responsivity. As the program
   moves forward, we hope to increase access, engagement, and adherence and
   provide a model for other PI countries.

   security and income around the globe. However, they face major
   challenges, including global market and demographic shifts, policy
   changes and climate variations that may threaten the wellbeing, health
   and safety of fishing communities. Over the years, various forms of
   spatial management have been implemented in small-scale fisheries as a
   potential solution to problems afflicting these systems. The benefits of
   such approaches can be numerous for both ecosystems and coastal
   communities. In addition to the persistent challenges influencing
   small-scale fisheries practices, the emerging effects of climate change
   pose serious risks to coastal ecosystems and fishing communities,
   especially in low-lying islands. Despite a growing recognition of both
   the benefits of spatial management and the adverse effects of climate
   change on small-scale fisheries, integration of these concepts in a
   consistent and comprehensive way has not yet occurred. Spatial
   management has the potential to foster small-scale fisheries adaptation
   to climate change, however, in the face of such a global and
   transboundary phenomenon, management strategies will need to be
   carefully designed and implemented. First, key considerations for
   climate-informed spatial management in small-scale fisheries were
   identified. Second, these key considerations were illustrated in two
   selected case studies in Pacific Island countries and territories (i.e.
   Fiji and Papua New Guinea). Finally, the challenges associated with
   spatial management in a changing climate are discussed and ways forward
   for advancing this type of management as a climate adaptation approach
   for small-scale fisheries in the Pacific and beyond are proposed.

AB This paper reports the results of a choice experiment (CE) that values
   the ecosystem service benefits from extending the current network of
   marine protected areas (MPAs) in St Vincent and the Grenadines (SVG),
   Caribbean. We considered two future options: an 'improved' scenario in
   which marine protection is increased, and a 'decline' scenario in which
   current protection mechanisms are removed. The CE was administered at
   two sites (the degraded St Vincent South Coast and the pristine Tobago
   Cays) and to tourists and local residents. Results suggest that both
   groups value health protection, fishing, coastal protection, ecosystem
   resilience, and diving/snorkelling. Values are higher for the 'decline'
   scenario compared to the 'improved' scenario. Also, tourists had
   significantly higher WTP values than locals. Our analysis also enabled
   an evaluation of the benefits derived from alternative policy
   interventions that may be used to protect and enhance SVG's marine
   parks. Stopping pollution from agriculture run-off and sewage was found
   to generate the highest ecosystem service benefits, with restricting
   over-fishing and bad fishing practices also being important We
   demonstrate how economic valuation of marine ecosystem service might be
   used to design and target marine conservation policies that maximise
   welfare benefits. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB This paper presents a summary of the forest fire reports in the insular
   Caribbean derived from both management reports and an analysis of
   publicly available Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectrodiometer (MODIS)
   satellite active fire products from the region. A vast difference
   between the amount of fires reported by land managers and fire points in
   the MODIS Fire Information for Resource Management System data can be
   observed. Future research is recommended to better understand the nature
   of these differences. While there is a general lack of available
   statistical data on forest fires in the Caribbean, a few general
   observations can be made: Forest fires occur mainly in dry forest types
   (500 to 1000 mm of mean annual rainfall). These are also the areas where
   most human settlements are located. Lowland high forests and montane
   forests with higher rainfall (1000 and more mm y(-1)) are less
   susceptible to forest fire, but they can burn in exceptionally dry
   years. Most of the dry forest ecosystems in the Caribbean can be
   considered to be fire-sensitive ecosystems, while the pine forests in
   the Caribbean (Cuba, Dominican Republic, and the Bahamas) are maintained
   by wildfires. In fire-sensitive ecosystems, uncontrolled burning often
   encourages the spread of alien invasive species. A Caribbean Fire
   Management Cooperation Strategy was developed between 2005 and 2006
   under auspices of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United
   Nations. This regional strategy aims to strengthen Caribbean fire
   management networking by encouraging closer collaboration among
   countries with similar ecological conditions. The strategy for the
   Caribbean identifies a number of research, training, and management
   activities to improve wildfire management capacity in the Caribbean.

AB The assemblages of the demersal and deep-water fish assemblages of the
   Cabo Verde archipelago are described for the first time from a total of
   20 longline hauls that extends from coastline to 1200 m water depth. A
   total of 98 species from 47 different families were caught, and despite
   the changes of biogeographic affinities with depth, the majority of the
   species are from a Subtropical and Tropical origin or have a broad
   geographic distribution (Wide and Amphiatlantic distributions) with
   small affinities with the Macaronesian islands and the Mediterranean.
   Depth distribution profiles show a clear turnover of species with depth,
   and an increase in the depth distribution range of the deeper living
   species. Furthermore, the indices of species abundance, biomass and the
   number of species caught, significantly decreased with increasing depth.
   Four main fish assemblages in a depth-aligned structure are proposed in
   the present work. A shelf assemblage mainly distributed above the 150 m
   depth strata, a shelf-break/upper-slope assemblage mainly between the
   150-350 m depth strata, a deep/upper-slope assemblage between the
   300-600 m depth strata, and a mid-deep/mid-slope assemblage mainly
   distributed below the 600 m. Species abundances and diversity found
   below 200 m is relatively low compared with shallow waters. The observed
   depth zonation of the slope assemblages, roughly agrees with the
   expected occurrence or influence of different water masses: shelf and
   surface mixing and seasonal thermocline depth zone, the depth range of
   occurrence of the intermediate waters (North Atlantic Central
   Water-NACW), the South Atlantic Central Water-SACW), and Atlantic
   Equatorial Water-AEW), a mixing or overlapping zone of previous
   intermediate water masses with the Antarctic Intermediate Water (AAIW),
   and the Mediterranean Outflow Water (MOW), and a deeper zone where the
   AAIW predominate. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB In late summer 2005 a mass coral bleaching event occurred in the
   Caribbean. Here we quantify coral bleaching in Barbados at six sites on
   the island's sheltered west and exposed southwest coasts, including
   nearshore fringing and patch reefs and offshore bank reef habitats.
   Onset of coral bleaching occurred in late August 2005 and persisted for
   many months after temperatures cooled. All reef habitats and virtually
   all coral taxa were affected, with an average of 70.6% of all colonies
   bleaching. Nearshore reefs (< 10 m depth) were affected more severely
   than offshore deeper reefs (> 15 m) with an average of 80.6% of all
   coral colonies bleaching compared with 60.5% on the latter.
   Inter-species variation in susceptibility to bleaching was marked with >
   90% of colonies bleaching in some species whilst < 10% bleached in
   others. Follow-up surveys revealed low coral mortality, with an overall
   mean of 3.8% partial colony death across all species and reefs by
   February 2006. However, bleached condition has persisted with a mean of
   37.7% of all coral colonies still bleached after 5 1/2 months,
   indicating that loss of live coral is likely to continue for some time.
   This event represents the most severe bleaching episode ever witnessed
   on Barbados' reefs and emphasises the vulnerability of small island
   states, with a high reliance on healthy coral reef ecosystem services,
   to elevated sea water temperatures associated with climate variability
   and global climate change.

AB Aim To test the hypothesis that communities with higher diversity have
   more predictable properties by examining patterns of community structure
   along a species richness gradient.
   Location Trinidad and Tobago (11 degrees 00 N, 61 degrees 00 W), on the
   South American continental shelf, opposite the Orinoco River delta,
   north-east Venezuela.
   Methods We used quantile regressions to investigate how three total
   abundance, absolute and relative dominance measures - numerical
   abundance, biomass and energy use, respectively - change across a
   species richness gradient. We investigated which allocation rule best
   mimics community assembly in this species richness gradient by examining
   the abundance of the dominant species and comparing it with predictions
   of niche apportionment models.
   Results All measures of total abundance increase on average across the
   gradient, but the upper limit remains constant. On average, absolute
   dominance is constant, but the distance between the upper and lower
   limits decreases along the gradient. Relative dominance decreases with
   species richness. Observed dominance patterns are best described by
   Tokeshi's random fraction model.
   Main conclusions Our results show that both total abundance and absolute
   dominance become increasingly variable as biodiversity decreases.
   Consequently, our study suggests that ecosystem properties are less
   predictable when biodiversity is lower.

   reviewed since its inception in 1995. During 1998, there were funding
   and administrative management problems. USDA resolved the acute funding
   crisis, and after three years of negotiation, the CAP has now secured an
   additional euro 1.5 million from the European Community. Changes in
   administration in 1998 included the withdrawal of IICA from the program,
   and the transition during the decentralization of administrative and
   financial management from FAO headquarters to the Regional Office for
   Latin America and the Caribbean, based in Chile. A general overview of
   technical progress and one case study, St. Kitts, is presented. One
   major concern that emerged during 2000 is that the elimination of the
   small remaining tropical bout tick (TBT) "hot spots" in both St. Kitts
   and St. Lucia remained elusive. Why is this so? Egrets? Alternative
   residual hosts? Or is it fatigue in both technical and administrative
   management functions? Of even greater concern is the finding of two,
   apparently new, foci in St. Croix (USVI) in the north and St. Vincent in
   the south. A critical overview of the program has identified one major
   remaining constraint-an appropriate management support function at both
   regional and, in some countries, at the national level. A proposal for a
   revised management strategy, coupled with the identification of a future
   strategy to succeed the CAP, namely a Caribbean Animal Resources

AB Small island developing states (SIDS) have limited access to imported
   goods, and their associated patterns of consumption and waste generation
   are affected by space limitations. They are also impacted by the global
   presence of marine litter that reaches their shores from the ocean. A
   material flow analysis (MFA) was applied to household solid waste and
   marine litter collected from Kayangel Island in the Republic of Palau to
   provide a comprehensive characterization and spatial accounting of the
   inflow of nonputrescible materials that become solid waste.
   Approximately 15,100 kg of nonputrescible solid waste are generated
   annually on Kayangel Island (0.42 kg per capita per day), with 57% being
   marine litter derived from the ocean and 43% derived from household
   activities. Household generation of nonputrescible solid waste (that
   ignores inputs of marine litter) ranged from 0.14-0.18 kg/capita-day for
   the school in session and nonschool periods, respectively. The most
   significant waste categories (by mass) include mixed material and
   nonrecyclable plastic wastes from both household sources and
   ocean-derived marine litter. Once nonputrescible solid waste is
   introduced, 0.39 kg per capita per day accumulates, 0.02 kg per capita
   per day is removed from the island via shipping, and 0.01 kg per capita
   per day is processed by open pit burning. Applying an MFA to solid waste
   on a SIDS links local and global solid waste generation with material
   fates, and may assist solid waste management practices. DOI:

AB Catch and fishing effort data from the Venezuelan Pelagic Longline
   Observer Program (VPLOP) in the Caribbean Sea and adjacent waters of the
   Atlantic were used to investigate the population structure, distribution
   and relative abundance of the blue shark, Prionace glauca. A total of
   959 blue sharks were sampled by trained observers during the period of
   January 1994 to December 2007. Fork length (FL) in males ranged from 79
   to 355 cm and from 97 to 349 cm in females. Sexual segregation at the
   spatial and temporal scale was observed, males dominated January-June
   and during October-December across all areas; while females dominated
   during July-September with a higher magnitude in the Atlantic side
   (Guyana-Amazon area). Sex ratio for mature (>180 cm FL) blue shark
   favored females in the Caribbean Sea from July to December, and in the
   Guyana-Amazon area in July-September; while immature blue sharks were
   dominated by males across all areas. Thirty-four pregnant females were
   caught in the Caribbean Sea and three in the Guyana-Amazon area.
   Pregnant females displayed a seasonal trend which increased from
   September through January, where >50% of the pregnant females occurred
   during November-January; of the pregnant females caught in the Caribbean
   Sea two had embryos close to the size-at-birth [>35 cm total length
   (TL)]. The spatial distribution of blue sharks in the Caribbean Sea was
   marked by high concentrations around the offshore islands of Venezuela
   and the Netherland Antilles year round; while in the Guyana-Amazon area
   the high concentrations were more seasonally localized off northeastern
   coast of South America but diminished progressively and by the end of
   the year was absent in the area. Relative abundance of blue shark was
   estimated from the Venezuelan pelagic longline (VPL) fleet using a
   General Linear Model Approach with a delta lognormal model distribution
   to account for the high proportion of zero observations. The variability
   within vessel groups was partitioned into each vessel variance and the
   auto-correlation within a vessel was evaluated by using a
   variance-covariance matrix model. Diagnostic checks and deviance table
   analysis were performed to identify the set of model factors and
   interactions that adequately explained the observed variability. The
   results indicated that variability of catch rates within vessels is as
   large as the variability among vessel groups, where smaller and medium
   size vessels show higher catch rates of blue sharks in the VPL fleet.
   Standardized catch rates indicated in general a lower relative abundance
   in the most recent years followed by a slight recovery that requires
   caution due to the predicted high variance. Fishing activities can have
   uneven effects in the blue shark population due to its spatial and
   temporal segregation in the study area; potential changes in the fishing
   operations of the VPL fleet can have negative effects in the population
   structure of blue sharks in the Caribbean Sea and adjacent waters if
   habitat for blue sharks are increasingly used to target other valuable
   species (e.g., large tunas and swordfish). (C) 2012 Elsevier By. All

AB Caribbean avifaunal biogeography has been mainly studied based on
   mitochondrial DNA. Here, we investigated both past and recent island
   differentiation and micro-evolutionary changes in the Zenaida Dove
   (Zenaida aurita) based on combined information from one mitochondrial
   (Cytochrome c Oxydase subunit I, COI) and 13 microsatellite markers and
   four morphological characters. This Caribbean endemic and abundant
   species has a large distribution, and two subspecies are supposed to
   occur: Z. a. zenaida in the Greater Antilles (GA) and Z. a. aurita in
   the Lesser Antilles (LA). Doves were sampled on two GA islands (Puerto
   Rico and the British Virgin Islands) and six LA islands (Saint
   Barthelemy, Guadeloupe, Les Saintes, Martinique, Saint Lucia and
   Barbados). Eleven COI haplotypes were observed that could be assembled
   in two distinct lineages, with six specific to GA, four to LA, the
   remaining one occurring in all islands. However, the level of divergence
   between those two lineages was too moderate to fully corroborate the
   existence of two subspecies. Colonisation of the studied islands
   appeared to be a recent process. However, both phenotypic and
   microsatellite data suggest that differentiation is already under way
   between all of them, partly associated with the existence of limited
   gene flow. No isolation by distance was observed. Differentiation for
   morphological traits was more pronounced than for neutral markers. These
   results suggest that despite recent colonisation, genetic drift and/or
   restricted gene flow are promoting differentiation for neutral markers.
   Variation in selective pressures between islands may explain the
   observed phenotypic differentiation.

AB Many coasts are eroding. In the Comoros, as in many other small island
   developing states (SIDS), communities frequently respond to coastal
   erosion by building seawalls-yet seawalls and other coastal defence
   structure are controversial, especially in a SIDS context, where they
   typically are poorly designed and constructed and thus tend to increase
   rather decrease erosion and are often unable to prevent flooding.
   Through an exploratory qualitative case study of Grande Comore, the main
   island of the Comoros (West Indian Ocean), we compare and contrast how
   local stakeholders, national elites and donors understand coastal
   erosion and flooding in the context of a changing climate and how they
   experience and perceive seawalls as a response measure. Our analysis
   suggests that although stakeholders are aware of different drivers of
   coastal erosion and flooding, including sand mining, seawalls are a
   frequent and customary response to coastal erosion and flooding. Little
   is known about their disadvantages or alternative response measures,
   especially among local community members. Further, a lack of capacity
   and resources leads not only to poorly designed and constructed seawalls
   but also to difficulties in enforcing rules and regulations such as bans
   on sand mining. From our exploratory study, three conclusions emerge:
   (1) local drivers of coastal erosion and flooding are more visible than
   global climate change while funding is more readily available for
   adaptation to climate change; (2) a mix of context and site-specific
   measures would be needed to adequately respond to coastal erosion and
   flooding; and (3) further information and knowledge about the extent and
   causes of coastal erosion and flooding as well as about the effects of
   different response measures would be needed to allow such context and
   site-specific measures.

AB Root crops are the major staple foods on the 33 atolls that constitute
   Kiribati. Babai or giant swamp taro (Cyrtosperma chamissonis), taro
   (Colocasia esculenta) and sweet potato (Ipomoea batatas are the
   principle edible root crops grown.
   Babai is the most important crop and it is grown using traditional
   methods of cultivation, handed down in secret from generation to
   generation. This crop is culturally significant and can produce corms up
   to 100 kg in weight. Island people cultivate the crop in pits dug to
   water table depth and amended with compost made from local plants.
   Production is very labour intensive.
   Where possible taro and sweet potato are cultivated in trenches dug in
   deep soils with high organic content. Most of the coral soils are
   deficient in nitrogen, potassium and trace elements such as iron,
   manganese, zinc and copper. As for the giant swamp taro, compost is the
   main amendment used. Rusty crushed tins may be added to combat iron
   deficiency. Small additions of a complete fertilizer give good crop
   responses, but care must be taken to avoid over-fertilising that
   pollutes the fresh water lens in the atoll.

AB Since Sao Tome and Principe were colonized by Europeans in the 1470s
   alien mammal species have been introduced to these islands.  The impact
   of these introduced species (14 to Sao Tome Principe and 12 to Principe)
   is unknown and though this paper reviews all the available information
   for each alien species no firm conclusions can be gleaned about their
   effect on the native biota of the Republica Democratica de Sao Tome e
   Principe.  Despite the probable long association of many, if not all,
   the alien mammals it is clear that the long history of deforestation and
   habitat modification has had a greater detrimental impact to date. 
   Although all the Red Data Book species are still present it is possible
   that the introduced mammals could cause future population declines and
   extinctions.  Research and surveys are urgently required to discover the
   current status, distribution and ecology of both the native Red Data
   Book species and the alien species.  These surveys, in conjunction with
   the identification of core areas for conservation would allow active
   management to control any detrimental impacts likely to be caused by the
   alien mammals.  Once identified, regular monitoring programmes should be
   undertaken to ensure that the conservation aims are being achieved.  At
   present there is a lack of any really suitable institutional
   organization with the responsibility or skills to undertake the required
   work.  The development of such an organization should be a priority and
   support should be given both in the short and long terms by
   international organizations such as Birdlife International and the Gulf
   of Guinea Conservation Group.

   regional climate model. The model simulates 'present-day' (1979-1990)
   rainfall and temperature climatologies reasonably well, capturing the
   characteristic bimodality of Caribbean rainfall and the boreal summer
   maximum and winter minimum temperatures. Seasonal spatial patterns are
   also reproduced, but rainfall amounts are underestimated over the
   northern Caribbean island masses, including Cuba, Jamaica, Hispaniola
   and Puerto Rico. Temperatures over the region are also overestimated by
   1-3 degrees C. For the period 2071-2100, temperatures are projected to
   increase across the region by 1-4 degrees C for all months irrespective
   of the scenario. The rainfall response varies with season with one of
   the more robust changes being an intensification of a gradient pattern
   in November-January, in which the northern Caribbean (i.e. north of 22
   degrees N) gets wetter and the southern Caribbean gets drier. There is
   also a robust June-October drying signal. The results point to changes
   in the regional circulation patterns due to the human-induced climate
   change and warrants further investigation. Copyright. (C) 2010 Royal

AB Background: The effective management and conservation of biodiversity is
   predicated on clearly defined conservation targets. Species number is
   frequently used as a metric for conservation prioritization and
   monitoring changes in ecosystem health. We conducted a series of
   synoptic surveys focusing on the fishes of the Bootless Bay region of
   Papua New Guinea to generate a checklist of fishes of the region.
   Bootless Bay lies directly south of Port Moresby, the capital of Papua
   New Guinea, and experiences the highest human population density of any
   marine area in the country. Our checklist will set a baseline against
   which future environmental changes can be tracked.
   Results: We generated a checklist of 488 fish species in 72 families
   found in Bootless Bay during a two-week sampling effort. Using
   incident-based methods of species estimation, we extrapolate there to be
   approximately 940 fish species in Bootless Bay, one of the lowest
   reported numbers in Papua New Guinea.
   Conclusions: Our data suggest that the Bootless Bay ecosystem of Papua
   New Guinea, while diverse in absolute terms, has lower fish biodiversity
   compared to other shallow marine areas within the country. These
   differences in faunal diversity are most likely a combination of unequal
   sampling effort as well as biophysical factors within Bootless Bay
   compounded by historical and/or contemporary anthropogenic disturbances.

AB Food web structure and function in ecosystems are a reflection of
   environmental conditions, this is especially apparent during extreme
   circumstances. The St Lucia estuarine-lake system in South Africa has
   recently experienced an unprecedented prolonged period of desiccation
   and hypersaline conditions caused by climatic variability and
   anthropogenic impacts. This has had a significant impact on species
   diversity, abundance and biomass. The system has received significant
   research attention over the past 70 years; however, little research has
   been conducted to understand how the system responds to changing
   environmental conditions as a whole. The aim of this study was to
   quantitatively assess the ecosystem response to different
   physico-chemical conditions and mouth states using ecological network
   analysis. The biomasses and trophic exchanges of various biotic species
   were estimated and used to establish ecological networks from which
   several ecosystem indices were calculated. Results indicate that the
   water level, salinity and mouth state have a significant impact on the
   total system biomass and productivity and the number and weight of
   energy flow pathways. These influence the biological structure and
   functioning of the St Lucia system. The substantial increase in the
   total living standing stock and species diversity during an intermittent
   open phase indicates that the system responds rapidly to such favourable
   conditions. This was reflected in the ecosystem indices calculated for
   before, during and after a breach which highlighted the importance of
   the short open mouth period after several years of mouth closure. Not
   only were biomass and productivity increased, but also the organisation
   of pathways to ensure more efficient energy transfer. At the same time
   adequate pathway redundancy was invigorated, resulting in a more robust
   and efficient functioning of the food web even after the re-closure of
   the inlet. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Singular value decomposition (SVD) techniques are used to deduce a

   signed sea-surface temperature anomalies in the Pacific and Atlantic.
   The analysis is done for four 3 month seasons. The first two seasons:
   November-January (NDJ) and February-April (FMA) encompass the Caribbean
   dry period, and the other two, May-July (MJJ) and August-October (ASO),
   include the early and late Caribbean rainy seasons. The first SVD mode
   for all seasons represents variability due to El Nino-southern
   oscillation (ENSO) and, with the exception of the later wet season, the
   second SVD mode represents variability due to tropical North Atlantic
   sea-surface temperatures. ENSO has the greatest impact during the late
   rainfall season (ASO) and the early dry season (NDJ), whereas the
   tropical Atlantic controls variability in the early rainfall season
   (MJJ). The configuration of concurrent but oppositely signed sea-surface
   temperature anomalies in the tropical Pacific and Atlantic basins is
   only associated with rainfall modification in the late Caribbean
   rainfall season (ASO) and the early Caribbean dry season (NDJ).

AB Recent satellite-tracked surface drifter trajectories were analyzed to
   describe the mean currents and eddies in the Caribbean Sea. The
   structure of the Caribbean Current and its variability were determined
   from high-resolution degree maps of the mean velocity and eddy kinetic
   energy. Looping drifter trajectories were used to identify discrete
   cyclones and anticyclones, and their characteristics were described and
   related to the structure of the mean flow. The translation rate of
   eddies in different areas was found to be similar to the mean velocity
   of the local background flow fields, suggesting that the eddies were
   largely advected by the background flow. Ten energetic anticyclones
   translated westward at 13cm/s in the Venezuela and Colombia Basins.
   These anticyclones tended to lie in two bands, centered near 15&DEG; N
   and 17&DEG; N, coinciding with two jets of the Caribbean Current. The
   northern weaker jet contains water primarily from the North Atlantic;
   the southern stronger jet contains water from the tropical and South
   Atlantic. The anticyclones are thought to have formed in the eastern
   Caribbean from the anticyclonic vorticity derived from North Brazil
   Current rings. The ring vorticity enters the eastern Caribbean through
   island passages and is probably amplified by the anticyclonic shear on
   the northern side of the jets. Southwest of Cuba a cyclone-anticyclone
   pair was observed to translate slowly (&SIM; 2cm/s) westward into the
   Yucatan Current. The cyclone was tracked for 10.5 months with four
   drifters, making it the longest tracked of the Caribbean eddies. &COPY;

AB Dispersal capabilities are crucial in how speciation patterns are
   determined in marine invertebrates. Species possessing a long-living
   planktonic larva apparently have a dispersal advantage over those with
   non-planktotrophic development, and their distant populations may
   exchange genetic material, maintaining a broad geographical range for
   the species. Recent species of the gastropod genus Bathytoma (Conoidea)
   are all characterized by non-planktotrophic development, having most
   probably lost a free-swimming larva in the pre-Pliocene, as Miocene
   fossils have protoconchs indicating planktotrophic larval development.
   All have a bathyal distribution (100-1500 m), which implies that their
   capability for direct expansion on the bottom is restricted by both
   deep-sea basins and shallow-water areas, especially in insular West and
   South-West Indo-Pacific. Therefore, it can be hypothesized that
   Bathytoma populations should represent numerous, mostly allopatric taxa
   restricted to a single or contiguous island groups. We tested this
   hypothesis using molecular and morphological characters independently.
   One hundred and thirty-eight specimens from the Philippines, Solomons,
   Vanuatu, and the Coral Sea were sequenced for one mitochondrial (COI)
   and one nuclear (ITS2) gene, and 14 operational molecular units were
   recognized. When these molecular units are overlaid over shell
   characters, 13 species (11 unnamed) and one form of uncertain status are
   recognized: three occur in the Philippines, six in the Solomons and one
   in New Caledonia. Broad distributions (inter-archipelagic) are uncommon
   (three species). On the whole, the phylogeographic pattern of the
   diversity in the genus is rather complex and probably also reflects
   processes of sympatric and fine-scale allopatric speciation, and local
   extinctions. The eleven new species are described and named.

AB The North Atlantic oscillation (NAO) is a large-scale seesawing movement
   of atmospheric mass between the North Atlantic subtropical high-pressure
   system and the Icelandic low-pressure system. This phenomenon has been
   acknowledged as the dominant mode of winter climate variability in the
   temperate latitudes of the North Atlantic region. In this Study, an
   attempt is made to identify the effect of the NAO on the rainfall
   pattern in the Eastern Caribbean, based on data from a representative
   station in that subregion.
   Rainfall data taken from a southeastern coastal station in Barbados are
   used to explore the relationship between the behavior of the NAO (using
   standardized monthly indexes) and the rainfall pattern at that station.
   In the period considered (1950-2004), the NAO is shown to have a very
   significant effect on the monthly variability of rainfall in Barbados
   during both El Nino and La Nina periods. Copyright (C) 2006 Royal

AB Even with increasing interest in rainforest conservation around the
   Pacific, it is highly unlikely that deforestation trends will be
   reversed without deep, structural changes in land management
   institutions. Fergusson Island, Papua New Guinea, is one of the most
   pristine islands on earth with primary rainforest and coral reefs. A
   number of institutional legacies have impeded conservation efforts and
   allowed for the expansion of poorly planned logging and mining
   extractive operations. The discussion ends at 1989 though problems from
   logging in Papua New Guinea have spawned numerous controversies and
   inquiries in subsequent years. A methodical framework for identification
   of obstacles derived from these legacies called conservation institution
   capability analysis, cica, is employed. The discussion ends with a
   rhetorical question of whether any amount of financial and
   administrative support can improve conservation effectiveness until
   basic institutional obstacles are removed through fundamental political
   change and improvements in living standards.

AB In order to evaluate the variability in surface water masses in the
   Western Pacific Warm Pool, we report high-precision radiocarbon
   measurements in annual and seasonal bands from Porites lutea corals
   collected from the Palau Archipelago (7 degrees N, 134 degrees E).
   Annual coral bands from 1945 to 2008 and seasonal samples from 1953 to
   1957 were analyzed to capture the initial early input of bomb C-14 from
   surface thermonuclear weapons testing in the Marshall Islands. Results
   show a pre-bomb average Delta C-14 value of -54.9% between 1945 and
   early 1953. Beginning early in 1954, there is a rapid increase to a
   maximum of -23.1% at the start of 1955. Values continued to rise after
   1957 to a post-bomb peak of 141% by 1976. The large initial rise in
   Delta C-14 cannot be accounted for by air-sea CO2 exchange. Results
   therefore suggest that the primary cause of this increase is the lateral
   advection of fallout-contaminated water from the Marshall Islands to
   Palau via the North Equatorial Current and then to the North Equatorial
   Countercurrent.

   Manipur), Chimbu (Central Highlands: Papua New Guinea), Onabasulu
   (Southern Highlands: Papua New Guinea), Kiriwina (Trobriand Islands:
   Papua New Guinea), Walbiri (Central Australia), Pintupi (Central
   Australia), and Maori (New Zealand/Aotearoa). Differences and
   similarities of entomophagous habits among the groups are briefly
   examined with regard to cultural, ethnic, and linguistic relationships.
   It Is postulated that prehistorically two centres in the region under
   discussion existed where entomophagy evolved and from where the practice
   spread: South-em India and Southeast Asia. It is further postulated that
   not protein-rich, but sugar- and fat-containing insects were the first
   species to find a place in the regular diet of prehistoric man. Species
   containing mostly protein were added to the local food spectrum later.
   According to this scenario, the food insect preferences of the
   Australian Aborigines reflect those of the earliest insect-eating
   humans. Evidence is also presented that domestication of the silkworm
   and use of its product (i.e., silk) could have arisen in Northeast India
   as early as 4000 years BC as a consequence of eating wild silkworm
   larvae and pupae.

   thought chickens were easy to care for, provide food for the family and
   was a good cash income enterprise. Some farmers were interested in
   keeping local chickens, but found it difficult to obtain the birds. The
   main feed sources are fresh coconut, copra meal, fish meal, mill run,
   food scraps and forage sources from the range. Some villagers believe
   that chickens only need to eat household scraps and did not provide
   drinking water. Many villagers lacked the knowledge of managing a
   village poultry enterprise. Some chicken houses were built by using bush
   materials or by purchasing construction materials. Farmers indicated
   they would like the government to provide funds for establishing a
   smallholder poultry enterprise and to provide information on feeding and

AB We characterize the vegetation of the Kingdom of Tonga, South Pacific,
   by exploring the effects of species-area relationships, species
   isolation, and long-distance dispersal. Published literature provides
   data for eleven main islands of Tonga on species richness, vegetation
   types, origins, and dispersal mechanisms. Island area, maximum
   elevation, distance from neighboring archipelagos, and island geology
   provide key variables with which to consider the configuration of
   Tonga's floral biodiversity. Vegetation communities are evaluated by
   dispersal mechanisms, species origins, and island age as reflected by
   geology. Species-area relationships are significant for all plant
   species and for ancient and modern introductions, and species richness
   shows significant relationships to maximum elevation for indigenous
   plants and modern introductions. In contrast, species richness on the
   islands of Tonga does not correspond to patterns expected for
   species-isolation relationships with the nearest archipelagos of Samoa
   and Fiji. Plant dispersal spectra vary significantly according to island
   topography, geology, vegetation types, and plant species origins. The
   youngest volcanic islands have the most wind-dispersed species, whereas
   the older limestone islands have more bird, water, and human-dispersed
   plants. Tongatapu, the largest and longest inhabited island, reflects
   the legacy of a deeply humanized landscape where more than half the
   plants are introduced. In contrast, on the sparsely populated, more
   remote islands, and in many vegetation types, 70 to 90 percent of the
   plants are native. Evidence for species introductions, varying impacts
   on different vegetation types, and associated changes in dispersal
   spectra reveal key aspects of biogeographic dynamics in Tonga and
   potentially for island biogeography elsewhere.

AB Although green turtles (Chelonia mydas Linnaeus) do not nest in
   Barbados, the easternmost island in the Caribbean archipelago, juveniles
   are regularly seen foraging in nearshore waters. To examine the stock
   composition of this foraging population, mitochondrial (mt) DNA control
   region sequences were analysed from 60 juvenile (31-70 cm curved
   carapace length) green turtles and compared with data published for key
   nesting populations in the Atlantic, as well as other feeding grounds
   (FGs) in the Caribbean. Eight distinct haplotypes were recognised among
   the 60 individual green turtles sampled around Barbados. Three of the
   haplotypes found have only previously been reported from western
   Caribbean nesting beaches, and two only from South Atlantic beaches. The
   nesting beach origin of one of the Barbados FG haplotypes is as yet
   unidentified. Stock mixture analysis based on Bayesian methods showed
   that the Barbados FG population is a genetically mixed stock consisting
   of approximately equal contributions from nesting beaches in Ascension
   Island (25.0%), Aves Island/Surinam (23.0%), Costa Rica (19.0%), and
   Florida (18.5%), with a lesser but significant contribution from Mexico
   (10.3%). Linear regression analysis indicated no significant effects of
   rookery population size or distance of the rookery from the FG on
   estimated contributions from the source rookeries to the Barbados FG.
   Our data suggest that the similar-sized green turtles sampled on the
   Barbados FG are a mixed stock of more diverse origins than any
   previously sampled feeding aggregations in the Caribbean region. The
   relatively large contribution from the Ascension Island rookery to the
   Barbados FG indicates that hatchlings from distant rookeries outside the
   Caribbean basin enter the North Atlantic gyre and become a significant
   part of the pool from which eastern Caribbean foraging populations are
   derived. These data support a life cycle model that incorporates a
   tendency of immatures to migrate from their initial foraging grounds at
   settlement towards suitable foraging grounds closer to their natal
   rookeries as they mature.

AB In Papua New Guinea the most important factor regulating fertility is
   virtually universal prolonged breastfeeding.  A prescription is required
   in order to purchase baby bottles and teats.  The current family
   planning program is designed to improve family health and welfare and
   not to affect population growth rates.  In drawing up its 1982 budget,
   the government decided to abolish the family planning program at the
   national level and transfer this function to provincial governments and
   to abolish the population program within the Office of Environment and
   Conservation.  The decision regarding the family planning program was a
   response to the policy of implementing the decentralizing health
   function to provincial governments.  The longterm effects of the
   decentralization of family planning are unclear as yet.  In Papua New
   Guinea the primary pressures toward large families are those associated
   with having children as a source of support in old age.  Parental
   expectations have changed traditional expectations of care and food to
   incorporate new forms of support from grown children who are educated
   and employed.  The value of child labor does not appear as great in
   Papua New Guinea as in other agricultural systems.  As yet Papua New
   Guinea does not have a specific population policy, but the government
   indicated its intention to formulate a policy in the National
   Development Strategy (NDS) adopted in 1976.  The NDS recognized the need
   to examine all the longer term implications of population growth and
   endorsed a population research program to this end.  A population
   program was approved for funding in 1978.  The program was designed to
   progress in 3 stages:  research and education; population policy
   formulation; and policy implementation, monitoring, and evaluation. 
   Although almost all family planning services are supported by the
   government, many of these services are delivered by nongovernment
   organizations.  Oral contraceptives (OCs) and injections (Depo-Provera)
   are the most widely available contraceptives.  The private Family
   Planning Association supported by the International Planned Parenthood
   Federation has a small program of community based distribution of
   contraceptives in 2 provinces and 1 urban clinic.

AB A new shallow-water species of the stenopodid shrimp genus Odontozona is
   described based on a specimen collected on a coral reef environment in
   the San Bernardo Islands, Caribbean coast of Colombia. Odontozona edyli
   n. sp. can be separated from all other congenerics by a combination of
   morphological characteristics, most notably the ornate abdomen with a
   distinct and complex pattern of spines, carinae and grooves, spination
   of the carapace, length of rostrum, armature of third cheliped, third
   maxilliped and telson. This new species is more similar to O. arbur and
   O. sculpticaudata from the Indo-Pacific than to any other species of
   Odontozona from the western Atlantic. An unreported male specimen of O.
   striata from Jamaica, Caribbean Sea revealed morphological differences
   with the female holotype described by Goy (1981), suggesting a possible
   sexual dimorphism or a high intra-specific variability as reported for
   some Indo-Pacific Odontozona species.

   full compliance of financial reporting expectations of the country's

   of the Auditor General's Office of Papua New Guinea, this study
   considers the financial reporting compliance of PNG Power for the period
   2007-2013, and the means by which compliant reporting may be improved.
   The results of the study reveal that the financial statements of PNG
   Power are late and receive disclaimers of opinion from the Auditor
   General's Office, which suggest that PNG Power's stakeholders are not
   receiving accurate and reliable financial information to make informed
   decisions about sustainable development of electricity usage and
   planning in Papua New Guinea. The study reveals that it would take
   little resources to improve PNG Power's reporting, which in turn could
   enhance national energy policy decision-making and energy utility
   accountability. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The fossil record of bats is extensive in the Caribbean, but few fossils
   have previously been reported from the Dominican Republic. In this
   paper, we describe new collections of fossil bats from two flooded caves
   in the Dominican Republic, and summarize previous finds from the Island
   of Hispaniola. The new collections were evaluated in the context of
   extant and fossil faunas of the Greater Antilles to provide information
   on the evolution of the bat community of Hispaniola. Eleven species were
   identified within the new collections, including five mormoopids
   (Mormoops blainvillei, dagger Mormoops magna, Pteronotus macleayii, P
   parnellii, and P quadridens), five phyllostomids (Brachyphylla nana,
   Monophyllus redmani, Phyllonycteris poeyi, Erophylla bombifrons, and
   Phyllops falcatus), and one natalid (Chilonatalus micropus). All of
   these species today inhabitant Hispaniola with the exception of dagger
   Mormoops magna, an extinct species previously known only from the
   Quaternary of Cuba, and Pteronotus macleayii, which is currently known
   only from extant populations in Cuba and Jamaica, although Quaternary
   fossils have also been recovered in the Bahamas. Differences between the
   fossil faunas and those known from the island today suggest that
   dispersal and extirpation events, perhaps linked to climate change or
   stochastic events such as hurricanes, may have played roles in
   structuring the modern fauna of Hispaniola.

AB Codas, which are patterned series of clicks, were recorded from female
   and immature sperm whales (Physeter macrocephalus) in a number of
   locations around the South Pacific Ocean and in the Caribbean Sea. Using
   K-means cluster analysis, 3,644 codas were categorized based on the
   number of clicks and their patterning. There were 30 resulting types of
   coda. The numbers of codas of the different types recorded were used to
   construct repertoires for each recording session, day, group of whales,
   place, area, and ocean. Strong group-specific dialects, which seem to
   persist over periods of years, were apparent, overlaid on weaker
   geographical variation. Significant differences in repertoire were found
   between the Caribbean and the Pacific Ocean. Sperm whales now join
   killer whales (Orcinus orca) as the only cetacean species in which
   dialects (differences in vocal repertoire among neighboring, potentially
   interacting groups) have been found.

AB Neolithic arrival in the Pacific involved, as in other parts of the
   world, the translocation of domesticated plants and animals by
   pottery-making cultures in prehistory. Globally uncommon, though, was
   the abandonment of pottery on some islands and the extirpation of the
   pig (Sus scrofa/verrucosus) and dog (Canis familiaris) - the two largest
   mammalian quadrupeds introduced to Oceania - from the subsistence and
   cultural systems. This paper examines the extirpation of pigs from the
   Palau Islands as a case study to understand why an important domesticate
   has such an uneven prehistoric distribution. When suids are fed
   agricultural produce required to sustain the human population, it has
   been proposed that competition and extirpation will result, especially
   on small islands with limited arable land. However, pigs are considered
   problem animals in many environments because of the damage they cause to
   horticultural production, particularly the effects of free-range pigs on
   gardens and plantations. It is suggested that extirpation and low-level
   animal keeping are a response to the threat that pigs pose to plant food
   yields and social relations.

AB In this policy review, we analyze two payments for hydrological services
   matching programs operating in the Antigua water basin in the state of
   Veracruz, Mexico. Mexico's Matching Program was created to transition
   from the national payments for hydrological services program to programs
   that would be financed by local governments, local water users and the
   private sector. Based on the analysis of organizational documents and
   key informant interviews with institutional actors, we describe the
   distinctive origins and organizational structures of these two programs,
   and how these differences have led to unique challenges for each
   program. We conclude that payments for ecosystem services programs that
   incorporate community-level organization and extensive technical
   assistance, along with expanded direct payments from ecosystem service
   users, have the greatest potential for achieving long-term
   sustainability.

AB Located on the Caribbean coast of Central America and flanked by the
   second longest barrier reef in the world, Belize is a nation reliant
   upon marine resources. Each year, the country's predominantly
   small-scale fisheries generate an estimated US$22 million in revenue -
   1.8% of GDP - and employ 3000 people. However, the nation's fishing
   communities are facing an unprecedented challenge. Existing threats
   posed by declining fish stocks have been exacerbated by the introduction
   of the invasive alien red lionfish Pterois volitans in 2008. This
   Indo-Pacific predator has the potential to cause significant losses to
   the recruitment of native fish, in turn disrupting coral reef community
   dynamics in the Belize Barrier Reef Reserve System, a UNESCO World
   Heritage Site. Howefver, targeted lionfish fishing may offer a cost
   effective means to control the invasion, while also creating an
   alternative livelihood solution and improving food security among
   Belize's coastal fishing communities. This study summarises the recent
   history of the lionfish invasion in Belize, describes the multi-sector
   approach being used to address the invasion, and presents preliminary
   research summarising the characteristics of invasive alien lionfish in
   Belize. Data from Belize's nascent 'lionfishery' are also presented,
   demonstrating that demand for lionfish is outweighing supply-largely as
   a result of awareness-raising initiatives- and highlighting the strong
   potential for replication of this approach elsewhere in the Caribbean.
   The study concludes by discussing the barriers and potential solutions
   to this market-based approach to invasive species management. (C) 2016

AB Seven ferromanganese crusts from the northwest intertropical Pacific
   seamounts were analyzed for photomicroscopic growth structures,
   microprobe chemistry, and ages based on Co-chronometer growth rate. The
   crusts on the Marshall Islands seamounts are thick and are divided into
   phosphatized lower older and nonphosphatized upper younger growth
   generations: the older crust consists of compact laminations and columns
   impregnated with carbonate fluoapatite (CFA), whereas the younger crust
   is characterized by porous botryoids and columns of delta-MnO2 and Fe
   oxyhydroxide. The crusts on the Federated States of Micronesia (FSM) and
   Palau Islands seamounts are thin and are often incorporated with
   inorganic opal-A in the uppermost part, comprising the younger
   generation. Some crusts show scours and fractures. Although the growth
   of crusts has been often interrupted by mass failure of slope sediments,
   the crusts on the Marshall Islands seamounts are estimated to have grown
   at rate of about 3 mm/Ma since the middle Eocene and to have been
   phosphatized in the late Oligocene during the host seamounts were
   located beneath the equatorial zone of high productivity. Prolonged
   infiltration of the oxygen minimum zone (OMZ) water into shallower water
   older crusts redistributed crust composition by precipitating CFA,
   enriching subsequent amounts of Mn and Ni, and removing some Co. The
   younger crust has formed at slower rate (about 2 mm/Ma) under the
   stronger influence of bottom-water circulation in the north of the
   equatorial zone, concentrating abundant Co. In the uppermost part of
   some crusts, siliceous skeletons transform with burial to inorganic
   opal-A and Si-rich Fe oxyhydroxide, suggesting that biosilica diagenesis
   can enhance crust growth. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights

AB In magmatic-hydrothermal and associated geothermal systems, acidic
   magmatic-derived fluids (pH<3) commonly discharge from springs proximal
   to the vent of active (degassing) volcanoes and more alkaline (pH>5)
   geothermal fluids are typically limited to lateral outflows some
   distance from the main vent. Here we describe an unusual hydrothermal
   system associated with Savo volcano, a recently eruptive (1830-1840 AD)
   trachyte-dominated island arc stratovolcano in the Solomon Islands. Hot
   springs (similar to 100 degrees C) near to the volcanic crater discharge
   alkaline waters instead of the more commonly recognised acidic fluids.
   The hydrothermal system of Savo dominantly discharges sinter and
   travertine-forming alkaline sulphate (pH 7-8) waters at hot springs on
   its upper flanks, in addition to a small number of lower discharge acid
   sulphate springs (pH 2-7). Alkaline sulphate fluids are dilute,
   chloride-poor (<50 mg/l), sulphate- (>600 mg/l) and silica-rich (>250
   mg/l). They have restricted delta(34)S(SO4) (5.4 +/- 1.5 parts per
   thousand) and delta(18)O(H2O) values (-4 parts per thousand; local
   non-thermal groundwater is 8 parts per thousand). Acid sulphate springs
   discharge low chloride (<20 mg/l), high sulphate (300-800 mg/l) waters,
   with variable silica (100-300 mg/l) and distinctly lower delta(34)S(SO4)
   values (-0.6 +/- 2.5 parts per thousand) compared to the alkaline
   sulphate fluids. They also display high delta(18)O(H2O) and delta D(H2O)
   relative to non-thermal groundwater.
   Geochemical modelling shows that water-rock reaction and dilution in the
   presence of secondary anhydrite, pyrite and quartz leads to chloride
   being diluted to low concentrations, whilst maintaining high sulphate
   and silica concentrations in the fluid. Strontium, oxygen and hydrogen
   isotopes confirm water-rock reaction and mixing with groundwater as

AB Understanding farmers' reasons for growing diverse crop portfolios is
   essential for supporting the conservation of agricultural biodiversity
   to foster social-ecological resilience and conserve crop genetic
   resources. In this paper, Q methodology is applied to examine the
   motivations for growing diverse crops among semi-subsistence rural
   farmers in Papua New Guinea. Various types of farmers are identified
   including so-called 'marketer-consumers,' who are highly motivated by
   crop sale, and 'exhibitionists,' who prioritize the 'show' values of
   crops. This approach can be applied to better target programs seeking to
   conserve crop diversity and promote new crop varieties in regions
   undergoing rapid transformation. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights

AB The fragmented island realm of Oceania includes a relatively small
   proportion of the world's tropical forests, but those forests support
   unusual richness of narrowly endemic species. In common with tropical
   forests across most of the world, tropical forests in Oceania are
   declining due to factors associated with increasing human population
   size, economic drivers and more intensive exploitation. In parts of
   Oceania, forests are being cleared at unsustainable rates, and replaced
   with far simpler ecosystems of timber or food crops. To a small degree,
   the present-day biodiversity of tropical forests in some parts of
   Oceania may be predisposed to such disturbance, given a history of
   natural disturbance (particularly through cyclones), and of
   smaller-scale slash-and-burn agriculture or landscape-scale burning.
   But, in most places, the current intensity, scale and/or rate of
   modification far surpass their precedents, and biodiversity is
   consequently diminishing. Tropical forests in Australia may be an
   exception to this trend, with now reasonably effective protection.
   However, more so than for tropical forests in most other continents, the
   major biodiversity conservation challenges for tropical forests in
   Oceania are extrinsic. Introduced plants, animals and diseases have
   collapsed ecological communities through much of Oceania, homogenising
   the biota from a series of highly distinctive and localised species
   assemblages to a more impoverished set of ubiquitous
   disturbance-tolerant exotic species. In many islands, this
   simplification has occurred regardless of the extent of native forest
   remaining, such that retention and reservation of primary forest is an
   insufficient conservation action. The fate of biodiversity in Oceania is
   also likely to be much affected by climate change, an unbalanced
   consequence given the region's relatively small contribution to
   greenhouse gas emissions. Future hope for biodiversity conservation in
   tropical forests of Oceania lies in the renewed application of some
   traditional management constraints, the appropriate delivery of
   international support (such as may be available through carbon markets),
   improved quarantine processes, and through some protection naturally
   offered by the remote scattering of the islands that comprise Oceania.

AB Quantifying forest change in the tropics is important because of the
   role these forests play in the conservation of biodiversity and the
   global carbon cycle. One of the world's largest remaining areas of
   tropical forest is located in Papua New Guinea. Here we show that change
   in its extent and condition has occurred to a greater extent than
   previously recorded. We assessed deforestation and forest degradation in
   Papua New Guinea by comparing a land-cover map from 1972 with a
   land-cover map created from nationwide high-resolution satellite imagery
   recorded since 2002. In 2002 there were 28,251,967 ha of tropical rain
   forest. Between 1972 and 2002, a net 15 percent of Papua New Guinea's
   tropical forests were cleared and 8.8 percent were degraded through
   logging. The drivers of forest change have been concentrated within the
   accessible forest estate where a net 36 percent were degraded or
   deforested through both forestry and nonforestry processes. Since 1972,
   13 percent of upper montane forests have also been lost. We estimate
   that over the period 1990-2002, overall rates of change generally
   increased and varied between 0.8 and 1.8 percent/yr, while rates in
   commercially accessible forest have been far higher-having varied
   between 1.1 and 3.4 percent/yr. These rates are far higher than those
   reported by the FAO over the same period. We conclude that rapid and
   substantial forest change has occurred in Papua New Guinea, with the
   major drivers being logging in the lowland forests and subsistence
   agriculture throughout the country with comparatively minor
   contributions from forest fires, plantation establishment, and mining.

AB Phanerophthalmus is a genus of Indo-West Pacific sea slugs inhabiting
   seagrass and coral reefs with up to now seven species currently
   recognised as valid. The goals of this study are to revise the
   systematics of Phanerophthalmus, infer its phylogeny and patterns of
   diversity, as well as study its diet. Morphology was combined with
   molecular phylogenetics based on two mitochondrial (cytochrome c oxidase
   subunit I, 16S rRNA) and one nuclear (28S rRNA) genes. Molecular species
   delimitation methods (ABGD, DISSECT) were employed to aid delimiting
   species. Diet was assessed by gut content analysis. Seventeen species
   were recognised, 10 of them new to science (P. albotriangulatum, sp.
   nov., P. anettae, sp. nov., P. batangas, sp. nov., P. boucheti, sp.
   nov., P. cerverai, sp. nov., P. lentigines, sp. nov., P. paulayi, sp.
   nov., P. purpura, sp. nov., P. rudmani, sp. nov., P. tibiricae, sp.
   nov.). Phanerophthalmus has its highest diversity in the Western Pacific
   where 13 species occur with a peak in the Coral Triangle (11 species;
   three only known from here). Diversity decreases towards the Central
   Pacific with five species and Indian Ocean/Red Sea with four species.
   Only two species are distributed across the Indo-West Pacific.
   Preliminary gut content analysis suggests these slugs feed on diatoms.

AB Most micronutrient deficiencies affect relatively few people in the
   Caribbean; however, many Caribbean residents are affected by anemia that
   appears due primarily to a lack of dietary iron. While generally
   substantial, the prevalences of such anemia have differed a good deal
   from place to place and study to study, observed rates ranging from 27%
   to 75% in pregnant women, 19% to 55% in lactating women, and 15% to 80%
   in young children. Severe anemia, defined by a blood hemoglobin
   concentration below 8 g/dl, has been found in approximately 6% of the
   pregnant women and 11% of the preschool children in some Caribbean
   countries. The principal ways of controlling iron deficiency anemia are
   through food fortification, control of intestinal parasites, direct oral
   supplementation, and dietary modification. Progress has been made in
   iron fortification of wheat flour and wheat products (the principal
   foodstuffs consumed by the general public in most of the
   English-speaking Caribbean). Data on control of relevant parasites in
   the Caribbean (primarily hookworm and to a lesser extent whipworm) are
   limited. Health services throughout the English-speaking Caribbean have
   been providing direct iron supplementation for pregnant women, but high
   levels of anemia during pregnancy still exist because of coverage,
   monitoring, and compliance problems. All the Caribbean countries also
   have education programs, which mainly advise pregnant women about
   iron-rich foods and iron absorption inhibitors and enhancers.

   consists of species that range widely among the west-central Pacific

   is based on a misassigned locality, in which case the range of the
   species would be limited to the Marshall Islands, Nauru, and Kosrae.
   There is no evidence to suggest that habitat modification on Nauru
   stemming largely from more than a century of phosphate mining has
   reduced the number of reptile species.

AB Biological invasions have critical impacts on native biodiversity and
   human societies and especially on oceanic islands that are fragile and
   threatened ecosystems. The invasive tiger mosquito Aedes (Stegomyia)
   albopictus (Skuse, 1894) native to Southeast Asia has been introduced
   during the past 30 years almost everywhere in the world, including the
   Americas, the Pacific, Europe and Africa. It has been reported for the
   first time in the Gulf of Guinea in 2000, first in Cameroon, then in
   Bioko Island in 2003 and more recently in Gabon in 2007. Here we report
   the first record of Ae. albopictus on Sao Tome Island. Although we
   cannot estimate precisely the year of introduction on Sao Tome Island,
   it most likely arrived within the last 10 years. By sequencing the
   mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase gene from individual adults, we
   detected three haplotypes already present in mainland Africa. More
   studies are needed to explore the dynamics of its expansion and
   competition with insular native mosquitoes.

AB "Kick'em Jenny" is a submerged active volcano located in the
   southeastern Caribbean off the island of Grenada. It is the southernmost
   active volcano, and the only active submerged volcano, in the Lesser
   Antilles volcanic arc. In 2003, an expedition to the volcano returned
   several specimens of caridean and penaeoidean shrimp collected at depths
   of approximately 260 m. The specimens represented three species, two
   oplophorids (Janicella spinicauda and Oplophorus gracifirostris) and one
   sergestid (Sergia sp., close to S. robusta). The latter is the first
   penaeoid shrimp recorded from the vicinity of any hydrothermal vent
   system. Interestingly, many of the shrimp were found immobile, lying on
   their side on the floor of the submerged volcano's caldera. All three
   species are known members of the mesopelagic community, raising the
   possibility (explored in a separate paper by Wishner et at., submitted)
   that they were killed or entrapped by the toxic volcanic gases in the
   water column. All three species are thus considered vagrants (sensu
   Martin & Haney, submitted) rather than vent endemics, as there are no
   obvious indications that any of the three species is modified for life
   at underwater hydrothermal regions.

AB Papua New Guinea through its former organization, the Department of
   Fisheries and Marine Resources, and the Food and Agriculture
   Organization of the United Nations used the ICES/ EIFAC Code of Practice
   to successfully introduce and transfer six exotic fish species into the
   Sepik River through the Stock Enhancement Program and the FISHAID
   Project. These fish were introduced into the Sepik-Ramu Basin, Papua New
   Guinea, from India, Nepal, Malaysia and Brazil. The introduced fish
   species have now established breeding populations and are contributing
   to improved fisheries. In the lowland floodplains of the Ramu and the
   Sepik Rivers the Java carp (Puntius gonionotus), Pacu (Piaractus
   brachypomum or Colossoma bidens), red makau (Tilapia rendalli) and
   Emily's fish (Prochilodus margravii) are now established. In the higher
   altitude streams; the snow trout (Schizothorax richardsonii), the golden
   mahseer (Tor putitora), now locally known as Tor and red makau (Tilapia
   rendalli ) have established breeding populations and are contributing to
   fish production. The status of two fish species remain unknown: the
   chocolate mahseer (Accrossocheilus hexagonolepis) and the giant gouramy
   (Osphronemus gouramy). The successful use of the ICES/EIFAC Code of
   Practice in a developing country environment such as Papua New Guinea
   was because the protocols of the Code of Practice had scientific rigour
   and because the Government is party to a number of international
   conventions on biodiversity and accepts responsible management of
   natural resources as an operating principle. The limitations to applying
   the Code of Practice are the lack of technical and infrastructure
   facilities in countries that implement the protocols and the lack of
   substantial funding. Following the successful introductions, the
   follow-up impact assessments and fisheries survey to quantify the
   breeding fish populations is now necessary. The results of the follow-on
   assessments may be a further learning process of the ICES/EIFAC Code of
   Practice in developing country situations and for Papua New Guinea
   policy-making for inland fisheries development.

AB Caribbean islands have increasingly turned to tourism as a pathway for
   economic advancement, often to the detriment of other industries,
   particularly agriculture. The influx of millions of tourists to these
   island destinations increases food demand, escalates food importation,
   and oftentimes results in food insecurity. Agritourism, an alternative
   tourism form, has been proposed as a way to stimulate domestic food
   production and increase food security. This article provides a selective
   examination of the possibilities of relationships between agritourism
   and food security in the context of a specific Caribbean island: New
   Providence, Bahamas. Drawing from semi-structured interviews and site
   visits with over sixty farmers, we focus on the experiences of three
   farms that have attempted to engage in agritourism, with different
   approaches, levels of success, and potential impacts on food security.
   We find that the potential for agritourism to transform food security
   for Caribbean islands is constrained by demand and the consumption
   standards of both residents and tourists. The type of agritourism that
   has thus far proven to be most appealing to tourists is unachievable for
   the majority of farmers, has inconsequential contributions to island
   food security, and privileges wealthy farmers. Unfortunately, in its
   current form, agritourism is not yet a viable solution for the food
   security issues of New Providence, let alone other Caribbean islands.

AB We investigated traditional coral reef management practices at Ahus
   Island, Manus Province, Papua New Guinea, to evaluate their social role
   in the community and potential to conserve reef ecosystems. For
   generations, Ahus Islanders have prohibited spear and net fishing within
   six delineated areas of their reef lagoon. One to three times per year
   fish are briefly harvested from the restricted areas to Provide food for
   ceremonial occasions. Underwater visual censuses of fishes revealed a
   significantly greater biomass and average size of target species within
   the restricted areas (205 kg/ha +/- 20 [SE]; 102 mm TL [total length]
   +/- 0.7) compared with areas without fishing restrictions (127 kg/ha +/-
   13 SF; 85 mm TL +/- 0.7). We estimated the biomass of fish removed
   during one of the harvest events was 5 to 10% of the available biomass
   within the restricted area, and in underwater visual surveys conducted
   before and after a harvesting event we detected no effect of harvesting
   on fish stocks. Compliance with the fishing restriction is attributed to
   its perceived legitimacy, its ability to provide the community with
   direct and indirect benefits, and its reflection of local socioeconomic
   circumstances. Limited-take closure systems that can serve the needs of
   a community may provide a viable conservation alternative in situations
   where compliance with fully closed protected-area regulations is low and
   resources for proper enforcement are untenable.

   Arcoscalpellinae), is proposed to accommodate Trianguloscalpellum
   rodstromi (Boone, 1927) from Belize and Z. volentis gen. et sp. nov.
   from the Lesser Antilles, both occurring on crinoids. These two species
   are unique in lacking lower lateral plates (inframedian or second
   latera, L2s). We see no compelling evidence that the lack of L2s in
   Zevinaella is a consequence of fusion with the carinolatera (CLs), as
   appears to be the case in a near relative T. pentacrinarum, or of
   progressive reduction and potential loss, as in older specimens of
   Amigdoscalpellum spp. (Zevina, 1978b). However, this does not weaken the
   diagnosis of the new genus and, accordingly, the diagnoses for the
   family Scalpellidae Pilsbry, 1907 and the subfamily Arcoscalpellinae
   Zevina, 1978b are amended to accommodate the absence of the L2s.

AB While island biogeography and modern economics portray Pacific island
   nations as isolated, ecologically fragile, resource poor and barely
   viable economies forever dependent on foreign aid, Pacific island
   history and culture conceives of their islands as intimately
   inter-linked to the surrounding ocean and of that ocean as an avenue to
   expanded resource bases, both terrestrial and aquatic. Pacific Islanders
   live in the most aquatic human zone on Earth, with the highest
   territorial ratios of sea to land. Recent studies are revealing the
   continuity and success of traditional near-shore guardianship of
   maritime resources in a number of Pacific islands. Sustainable
   development of seabed minerals and pelagic fisheries may offer enhanced
   income potential for small island nations with limited terrestrial
   resources. As offshore ecosystems are poorly policed, sustainable
   development is best realized through comprehensive planning centred on
   partnerships between local communities, their governments, marine
   scientists and commercial enterprises. The success or failure of Pacific
   Islanders in reasserting their maritime guardianship is now a matter of
   global significance given the decimation of most fisheries beyond the
   Pacific and the vast, but uncertain, medicinal, mineral and food
   resource potential of this huge area of the planet.

AB Changes in circulation associated with the shoaling of the Isthmus of
   Panama and the Caribbean carbonate crash in the Miocene were
   investigated using Nd isotopes from fossil fish teeth and debris from
   two sites in the Caribbean Basin (Ocean Drilling Program Sites 998 and
   999) and two sites in the eastern equatorial Pacific (Sites 846 and
   1241). The total range for epsilon(Nd) values measured from 18 to 4.5 Ma
   in the Caribbean is -7.3 to 0. These values are higher than Atlantic
   water masses (similar to-11) and range up to values equivalent to
   contemporaneous Pacific water masses, confirming that flow into the
   Caribbean Basin was composed of a mixture of Pacific and Atlantic
   waters, with an upper limit of almost pure Pacific-sourced waters.
   Throughout the Caribbean record, particularly during the carbonate crash
   (10-12 Ma), low carbonate mass accumulation rates (MARs) correlate with
   more radiogenic epsilon(Nd) values, indicating increased flow of
   corrosive Pacific intermediate water into the Caribbean Basin during
   intervals of dissolution. This flow pattern agrees with results from
   general ocean circulation models designed to study the effect of the
   shoaling of the Central American Seaway. Low carbonate MARs and high
   epsilon(Nd) values also correlate with intervals of increased Northern
   Component Water production and, therefore, enhanced conveyor
   circulation, suggesting that the conveyor may respond to changes in
   circulation associated with shoaling of the Central American Seaway.
   Reduced Pacific throughflow related to shoaling of the seaway led to a
   gradual increase in carbonate preservation and more Atlantic-like
   epsilon(Nd) values following the carbonate crash.

AB The world's governments have committed to preventing the extinction of
   threatened species and improving their conservation status by 2020.
   However, biodiversity is not evenly distributed across space, and
   neither are the drivers of its decline, and so different regions face
   very different challenges. Here, we quantify the contribution of regions
   and countries towards recent global trends in vertebrate conservation
   status (as measured by the Red List Index), to guide action towards the
   2020 target. We found that. 50% of the global deterioration in the
   conservation status of birds, mammals and amphibians is concentrated
   in,1% of the surface area, 39/1098 ecoregions (4%) and eight/195
   countries (4%) - Australia, China, Colombia, Ecuador, Indonesia,
   Malaysia, Mexico, and the United States. These countries hold a third of
   global diversity in these vertebrate groups, partially explaining why
   they concentrate most of the losses. Yet, other megadiverse countries -
   most notably Brazil (responsible for 10% of species but just 1% of
   deterioration), plus India and Madagascar - performed better in
   conserving their share of global vertebrate diversity. Very few
   countries, mostly island nations (e.g. Cook Islands, Fiji, Mauritius,
   Seychelles, and Tonga), have achieved net improvements. Per capita
   wealth does not explain these patterns, with two of the richest
   countries - United States and Australia - fairing conspicuously poorly.
   Different countries were affected by different combinations of threats.
   Reducing global rates of biodiversity loss will require investment in
   the regions and countries with the highest responsibility for the
   world's biodiversity, focusing on conserving those species and areas
   most in peril and on reducing the drivers with the highest impacts.

AB Late Cenozoic benthic foraminiferal faunas from the Caribbean Deep Sea
   Drilling Project (DSDP) Site 502 (3052 m) and East Pacific DSDP Site 503
   (3572 m) were analyzed to interpret bottom-water masses and
   paleoceanographic changes occurring as the Isthmus of Panama emerged.
   Major changes during the past 7 Myr occur at 6.7-6.2, 3.4, 2.0, and 1.1
   Ma in the Caribbean and 6.7-6.4, 4.0-3.2, 2.1, 1.4, and 0.7 Ma in the
   Pacific. Prior to 6.7 Ma, benthic foraminiferal faunas at both sites
   indicate the presence of Antarctic Bottom Water (AABW). After 6.7 Ma
   benthic foraminiferal faunas indicate a shift to warmer water masses:
   North Atlantic Deep Water (NADW) in the Caribbean and Pacific Deep Water
   (PDW) in the Pacific. Flow of NADW may have continued across the rising
   sill between the Caribbean and Pacific until 5.6 Ma when the Pacific
   benthic foraminiferal faunas suggest a decrease in bottom-water
   temperatures. After 5.6 Ma deep-water to intermediate-water flow across
   the sill appears to have stopped as the bottom-water masses on either
   side of the sill diverge.
   The second change recorded by benthic foraminiferal faunas occurs at 3.4
   Ma in the Caribbean and 4.0-3.2 Ma in the Pacific. At this time the
   Caribbean is flooded with cold AABW, which is either gradually warmed or
   is replaced by Glacial Bottom Water (GBW) at 2.0 Ma and by NADW at 1.1
   Ma. These changes are related to global climatic events and to the depth
   of the sill between the Caribbean and Atlantic rather than the rising
   Isthmus of Panama. Benthic foraminiferal faunas at East Pacific Site 503
   indicate a gradual change from cold PDW to warmer PDW between 4.0 and
   3.2 Ma. The PDW is replaced by the warmer, poorly oxygenated PIW at 2.1
   Ma. Although the PDW affects the faunas during colder intervals between
   1.4 and 0.7 Ma, the PIW remains the principal bottom-water mass in the
   Guatemala Basin of the East Pacific.

AB Lobomycosis and lobomycosis-like diseases (LLD) (also:
   paracoccidioidomycosis) are chronic cutaneous infections that affect
   Delphinidae in tropical and subtropical regions world-wide. In the
   Americas, these diseases have been relatively well-described, but gaps
   still exist in our understanding of their distribution across the
   continent. Here we report on LLD affecting inshore bottlenose dolphins
   Tursiops truncatus from the Caribbean waters of Belize and from the
   eastern tropical Pacific Ocean off the southwestern coast of Mexico.
   Photo-identification and catalog data gathered between 1992 and 2017 for
   371 and 41 individuals, respectively from Belize and Mexico, were
   examined for the presence of LLD. In Belize, 5 free-ranging and 1
   stranded dolphin were found positive in at least 3 communities with the
   highest prevalence in the south. In Guerrero, Mexico, 4 inshore
   bottlenose dolphins sighted in 2014-2017 were affected by LLD. These
   data highlight the need for histological and molecular studies to
   confirm the etiological agent. Additionally, we document a single case
   of LLD in an adult Atlantic spotted dolphin Stenella frontalis in
   southern Belize, the first report in this species. The role of
   environmental and anthropogenic factors in the occurrence, severity, and
   epidemiology of LLD in South and Central America requires further
   investigation.

AB Coastal and small island communities in Southeast Asia face daily
   threats from the impacts of climate change and climate-related hazards.
   This paper describes and analyses local and indigenous knowledge and
   practices related to climate-related hazards identified and documented
   in Indonesia, the Philippines and Timor-Leste. These include
   observations of changes in the environment and celestial bodies to
   predict climate-related hazards. Communities use local materials and
   methods to prevent and/or mitigate such hazards, and adapt to and
   prepare for them. Rituals and ceremonies are based on traditional or
   religious beliefs. Together with customary laws that govern behaviour,
   these rituals engender and reinforce respect for the environment,
   strengthen social cohesion, and thus help communities to better face and
   respond to the impacts of climate change and climate-related hazards.
   After going through a process of documentation, analysis and validation,
   local and indigenous knowledge can be grouped and categorised, which
   helps us better understand how such knowledge can be integrated with
   science. This will then enable communities to develop strategies to cope
   with climate-related hazards and adapt to climate change. Scientists,
   practitioners and policy-makers can also harness this knowledge for
   further research, education, and policy. It is important to promote the
   transmission of local and indigenous knowledge to increase community

AB Shellfish gathering has received comparatively little attention in the
   anthropological literature. Yet, the contribution of shellfish to the
   diet of indigenous societies can be significant. Reef and lagoon
   gleaning activities in Kiribati, Micronesia illustrate the importance of
   this class of invertebrates, particularly on urban South Tarawa.
   Proximate composition of 24 bivalves and gastropods add to our knowledge
   of the nutritional value of tropical shellfish. Microbiological
   contamination remains a problem, however, notably among inshore
   shellfish collected from Tarawa Lagoon. Assays on one species of cowrie
   (Cypraca tigris) confirm its toxicological properties, as suggested by
   some informants. The future of shellfish resources in Kiribati will need
   to address the issue of open access associated with an erosion of
   customary marine tenure.

AB Indo-Pacific lionfish (Pterois volitans and P. miles) have spread
   swiftly across the Western Atlantic, producing a marine predator
   invasion of unparalleled speed and magnitude. There is growing concern
   that lionfish will affect the structure and function of invaded marine
   ecosystems, however detrimental impacts on natural communities have yet
   to be measured. Here we document the response of native fish communities
   to predation by lionfish populations on nine coral reefs off New
   Providence Island, Bahamas. We assessed lionfish diet through stomach
   contents analysis, and quantified changes in fish biomass through visual
   surveys of lionfish and native fishes at the sites over time. Lionfish
   abundance increased rapidly between 2004 and 2010, by which time
   lionfish comprised nearly 40% of the total predator biomass in the
   system. The increase in lionfish abundance coincided with a 65% decline
   in the biomass of the lionfish's 42 Atlantic prey fishes in just two
   years. Without prompt action to control increasing lionfish populations,
   similar effects across the region may have long-term negative
   implications for the structure of Atlantic marine communities, as well
   as the societies and economies that depend on them.

AB Spatial statistical analyses of child anthropometric data were
   undertaken to assess the influence of systems of subsistence
   agriculture, in terms of staple foods and cash crops cultivated, on
   patterns of child growth in Papua New Guinea. These agricultural data
   explained between a quarter and half of the geographical variation in
   anthropometric growth indicators. Accounting for differences in
   altitude, relief and rainfall patterns, though explaining additional
   geographical variation, did not improve the predictions. Child growth
   was better in agriculture systems with cassava and sweet potato as
   staple crops, but worse in systems where banana, sago and taro were
   staple crops. Both the cultivation of all major cash crops, and sales of
   fish and food crops improved child growth. More intensive agricultural
   systems were associated with larger children indicating that the
   nutritional status of children benefited from intensification as well as
   from the introduction of cash crops into traditional subsistence
   systems.

AB The domestic dog (Canis familiaris) is considered to be the oldest

   and Australia-New Guinea relatively late in the Holocene, though the
   timing and means of its dispersal remain unclear. We report a dog burial
   from Timor-Leste dated to similar to 3000 cal. BP. Morphometric analysis
   demonstrates strong affinities between this individual and contemporary
   domestic dog groups, and particularly with the 'village dog' type,
   indicating it was indeed domesticated, rather than feral-wild. Isotope
   values which indicate a diet dominated by terrestrial plant foods rather
   than hunted foods suggest an association between the Timor dog and
   agriculturalists. Results suggest that the range expansion of C.
   familiaris in the Indo-Pacific is associated with the dispersal of
   farming groups in prehistory.

AB Time-averaged circulation is examined using historical hydrographic data
   near the Australia and Papua New Guinea coast in the Pacific. By
   averaging the data along isopycnal surfaces in a 0.5degrees x 0.5degrees
   grid, the authors are able to show many detailed phenomena associated
   with the narrow western boundary currents, including the vertical
   structure of the bifurcation latitude of the South Equatorial Current
   (SEC) and the connection between the Solomon and Coral Seas. The
   bifurcation latitude of the SEC is found to move southward from about
   15degreesS near the surface to south of 22degreesS in the intermediate
   layers. The origin of the Great Barrier Reef Undercurrent (GBRUC) is
   identified to be at about 22degreesS. Farther to the north, the GBRUC
   intensifies underlying the surface East Australian Current, and merges
   with the North Queensland Current (NQC) at about 15degreesS. The NQC
   turns eastward to flow along the Papua New Guinea coast and feeds into
   the New Guinea Coastal Undercurrent (NGCUC) through the Louisiade
   Archipelago. Further analysis shows that there is a strong water
   property connection between the Coral and Solomon Seas, confirming the
   earlier speculation on the water mass origins of the NGCUC.

AB Whip spiders (Amblypygi) are a small and understudied group of arachnids
   characterized by long antenniform legs and raptorial pedipalps. Due to
   their nocturnal habits, secretive nature and geographical distribution
   there have been very few studies of feeding behavior in this group.
   Here, we report a remarkable foraging strategy adopted by the giant
   tropical whip spider Heterophrynus cheiracanthus (Gervais 1844)
   inhabiting rocky outcrops adjacent to mountain streams running through
   primary tropical rainforest on the Caribbean island of Tobago.
   Heterophrynus cheiracanthus positions itself close to the stream edge on
   a vertical rock surface with pedipalps fully extended and antenniform
   legs frequently enterin, the shallow water. Freshwater prawns of the
   genus Macrobrachium are caught while still submerged in the water
   despite the whip scorpion being unable to use the trichobothria on the
   walking legs. Possible mechanisms of prey detection are discussed.

   is demonstrated in the Smallholder Market Access and Food Supply
   Programme of the Department of Agriculture and Livestock.  The

   excludes participation of beneficiaries and their logics.  Paradoxically
   its very strength-its appeal to a modernist logic-may also prevent it
   being used to bring about a meaningful development process.

AB A rapidly developing tourism industry, concentrated in coastal regions,
   is suspected to seriously impact upon biodiversity in the global
   conservation priority of the insular Caribbean. In St Lucia,
   construction of tourism infrastructure in the coastal dry forest
   threatens the Endangered White-breasted Thrasher Ramphocinclus
   brachyurus. Long-term protection of habitat is vital, but design of such
   conservation action is constrained by lack of data on the species'
   distribution and population responses to habitat change and
   fragmentation. Distance sampling surveys were conducted in 2006 and 2007
   to estimate numbers and map the distribution of the two remaining
   sub-populations. White-breasted Thrashers in St Lucia were estimated to
   number around 1,200 individuals, with roughly 1,050 birds occupying just
   over 600 ha of dry forest in the Mandele area. We demonstrate that
   tourist development companies will likely soon own land constituting
   around 40% of the species' extent of occurrence on St Lucia, and nearly
   35% globally, and that ongoing and planned tourist developments threaten
   around one third of the St Lucian White-breasted Thrasher population.
   Given the size of these potential impacts, it is vital that patches of
   dry forest to the west and north of a development site in the Mandele
   area are safeguarded. These sites support White-breasted Thrashers at
   high density and are contiguous with an existing forest reserve. Other
   important conservation measures include preserving stands of connected
   mature dry and riparian forest inside the tourist development sites,
   alongside invasive predator control.

AB Epipelic diatom flora was sampled around the South African coast between
   the Olifants Estuary, on the cool Atlantic Ocean northwest coast, and
   the St. Lucia Estuary, on the Indian Ocean northeast coast. Altogether,
   333 taxa were identified with 14 being ubiquitous, as they were found in
   the cool temperate, warm temperate, and subtropical areas, as well as in
   St. Lucia Estuary situated close to Mocambique. There was little
   difference between the epipelic diatom species present in intertidal and
   subtidal areas and, because many of the species have a high tolerance to
   salinity, with some being found in conditions ranging from freshwater to
   a salinity of more than 150 psu, it was concluded that many of the
   species sampled do not appear to be reliable indicators for assessing
   salinity in South African estuaries. Although there was a wide spread of
   diatoms across all of the estuaries around the coast, the greatest
   species similarity occurred between the Olifants, Great Berg and Breede
   estuaries, suggesting that the Breede Estuary, normally considered to
   fall within the warm temperate region, may be more similar to the cool
   temperate type estuaries. Data also showed that there was very little
   similarity between the diatom flora in the rivers flowing into estuaries
   and the diatom flora in the estuaries.

AB Conservationists have long been interested in the biodiverse country of
   Papua New Guinea but have had limited success on the ground. Direct
   payments for conservation appeal to Western conservationists because
   they compete with the material benefits from resource extraction
   enterprises. Direct payments are also attractive to Melanesian villagers
   because they appear to be the beginning of socially appropriate
   reciprocal relationships with conservationists. Market-based
   conservation assumes exchange takes place between independent,
   self-interested actors, but Melanesian villagers assume that exchange
   takes place between morally obligated, interdependent actors. Such
   cultural differences led to contradictory expectations and friction
   between conservationists and villagers in Wanang Conservation, the
   particular ethnographic focus of this article. However, direct payments
   have simultaneously satisfied some expectations of both parties. Direct
   payments may be useful in conservation but for different reasons than
   expected. They succeed as part of a wider socially acceptable reciprocal
   relationship, but direct payments alone will likely fail.

AB Aim Lionfish (Pterois volitans and P. miles) are popular ornamental
   fishes native to the Indo-Pacific that were introduced into Florida
   waters and are rapidly spreading and establishing throughout the Western
   Atlantic (WA). Although unfortunate, this invasion provides an excellent
   system in which to test hypotheses on conservation biology and marine
   biogeography. The goals of this study are: (1) to document the
   geographical extent of P. volitans and P. miles; (2) to determine
   whether the progression of the lionfish invasion is the result of
   expansion following the initial introduction event or the consequence of
   multiple introductions at various WA locations; and (3) to analyse the
   chronology of the invasion in conjunction with the genetic data in order
   to provide real-time assessments of hypotheses of marine biogeography.
   Location The Greater Caribbean, including the US east coast, Bermuda,
   the Bahamas and the Caribbean Sea.
   Methods Mitochondrial control region sequences were obtained from
   lionfish individuals collected from Bermuda and three Caribbean
   locations and analysed in conjunction with previously published data
   from five native and two non-native locations (US east coast and the
   Bahamas; a total of six WA locations). Genetic variation within and
   among groups was quantified, and population structure inferred via
   spatial analyses of molecular variance, pairwise Phi(ST), exact tests,
   Mantel tests and haplotype networks.
   Results Mitochondrial DNA screening of WA lionfish shows that while P.
   miles is restricted to the northernmost locations (Bermuda and the US
   east coast), P. volitans is ubiquitous and much more abundant. Invasive
   populations of P. miles and P. volitans have significantly lower levels
   of genetic diversity relative to their native counterparts, confirming
   that their introduction resulted in a strong founder effect. Despite the
   relative genetic homogeneity across the six WA locations, population
   structure analyses of P. volitans indicate significant differentiation
   between the northern (US east coast, the Bahamas and Bermuda) and the
   Caribbean populations.
   Main conclusions Our findings suggest that the ubiquity of WA lionfish
   is the result of dispersal from a single source of introduction in
   Florida and not of multiple independent introductions across the range.
   In addition, the progression of the lionfish invasion (as documented
   from sightings), integrated with the genetic evidence, provides support
   for five of six major scenarios of connectivity and phylogeographical
   breaks previously inferred for Caribbean organisms.

AB A process-orientated understanding of ecosystems usually starts with an
   exploratory analysis of empirical relationships among potential drivers
   and state variables. While relationships among herbivory, algal cover,
   and coral recruitment, have been explored in the Caribbean, the nature
   of such relationships in the Pacific appears to be variable or unclear.
   Here, we examine potential drivers structuring the benthos and
   herbivorous fish assemblages of outer-shelf reefs in Micronesia (Palau,
   Guam and Pohnpei). Surveys were stratified by wave exposure and
   protection from fishing. High biomass of most herbivores was favoured by
   high wave exposure. High abundance of large-bodied scarids was
   associated with low turf abundance, high coral cover, and marine
   reserves. The remaining herbivores were more abundant in reefs with low
   coral cover, possibly because space and hence food limitation occur in
   high-coral-cover reefs. Rugosity had no detectable effect on herbivorous
   fish abundance once differences in exposure and coral cover were
   accounted for. At identical depths, high wave exposure was associated
   with greater volumes (cover x canopy height) of macroalgae and algal
   turfs, which most likely resulted from high primary productivity driven
   by flow. In exposed areas, macroalgal cover declined as the acanthurid
   biomass increased. The volume of algal turfs was negatively associated
   with coral cover and herbivore biomass. In turn, high coral cover and
   herbivore biomass are likely to intensify grazing. The density of
   juvenile corals was variable where macroalgal cover was low but was
   confined to lower densities where macroalgal cover was high. High coral
   cover and density of juvenile corals were favoured in sheltered
   habitats. While a weak positive relationship was found between scarid
   biomass and juvenile coral density, we hypothesise that high scarid
   densities may hinder juvenile density through increased corallivory. New
   hypotheses emerged that will help clarify the role of acanthurids, wave
   exposure, and corallivory in driving the recovery of Pacific coral

   Rica: Cyclostrema tortuganum, Rissoina c.f. fenestrata, Vanikoro
   oxychone, Epitonium c.f. denticulatum, Latirus infundibulum, Hastula
   salleana, Daphnella lymneiformis and Tenaturris c.f. inepta. Thirteen
   species are found on the Caribbean and Pacific coasts of Costa Rica:
   Tegula fasciata, Cymatium nicobaricum, Anachis lyrata, Costoanachis
   varia, Mitrella ocellata, Agaronia testacea, Hastula cinerea,
   Architectonica nobilis, Dolabrifera dolabrifera, Stylocheilus striatus,
   Cavolinia longirostris, Phidiana lascrucensis and Spurilla neapolitana.
   In comparison with a recent report of the Caribbean and western Atlantic
   gastropods of Colombia, the Costarican fauna hardly presents 35.8% of
   those species. Similarly, in comparison with a work from Panama, the
   quantity of species shared between Costa Rica and its nearby country is
   48.2%. The number of species reported here is probably an
   underestimation because few micromolluscs have been studied and no
   samples have been collected in deep waters nor in the north part of the

AB This paper examines wildlife tourism in Papua New Guinea (PNG) from both
   a demand and supply perspective. PNG, a developing nation, situated just
   north of Australia, is located in a 'biodiversity hotspot' and its
   wildlife comprises a large number of species or groups of species,
   including many which are endemic to the nation, that would appear, on
   face value, to be highly attractive to tourists. An assessment is made
   of the wildlife tourism prospects for PNG based on the sustainable use
   of wildlife concept. Analysis of characteristics relating to 'wildlife
   tourism value' of selected animal groups suggests that the best
   prospects for wildlife tourism lie with birds, marine wildlife and,
   perhaps, some terrestrial invertebrates. The paper also examines the
   potential impacts that wildlife threatening processes such as hunting,
   loss of wildlife habitat and, in particular, global climate change,
   could have on the future of wildlife tourism in PNG.

AB We test the hypothesis that the Pacific Ocean contributes moisture to
   the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) over southern Central America,
   by spatial analysis of surface water delta O-18 values from Panama and
   Costa Rica. The delta O-18 values decrease with distance from the
   Caribbean Sea to the isthmian divide then gradually increase from the
   divide toward the Pacific slope, which suggests a contribution of both
   Caribbean and Pacific sourced moisture to the isthmus. We estimated the
   Pacific moisture contribution for Pacific slope regions of 22% to 64%.
   The delta O-18 values from stalagmites from five cave systems
   demonstrate decreasing delta O-18 values with distance from the
   Caribbean, implicating the Atlantic Basin as a dominant moisture source.
   Constraining modern moisture sources is important for the interpretation
   of stable isotopic proxy records of past rainfall, because of the
   combined influence of Pacific and Atlantic ocean-atmosphere phenomena on
   ITCZ rainfall over the Isthmus of Panama.

AB Background: Colonial invertebrates such as corals exhibit nested levels
   of modularity, imposing a challenge to the depiction of their
   morphological evolution. Comparisons among diverse Caribbean gorgonian
   corals suggest decoupling of evolution at the polyp vs. branch/internode
   levels. Thus, evolutionary change in polyp form or size (the colonial
   module sensu stricto) does not imply a change in colony form
   (constructed of modular branches and other emergent features). This
   study examined the patterns of morphological integration at the
   intraspecific level. Pseudopterogorgia bipinnata (Verrill)
   (Octocorallia: Gorgoniidae) is a Caribbean shallow water gorgonian that
   can colonize most reef habitats (shallow/exposed vs. deep/protected;
   1-45 m) and shows great morphological variation. Results: To
   characterize the genotype/environment relationship and phenotypic
   plasticity in P. bipinnata, two microsatellite loci, mitochondrial
   (MSH1) and nuclear (ITS) DNA sequences, and (ITS2) DGGE banding patterns
   were initially compared among the populations present in the coral reefs
   of Belize (Carrie Bow Cay), Panama (Bocas del Toro), Colombia
   (Cartagena) and the Bahamas (San Salvador). Despite the large and
   discrete differentiation of morphotypes, there was no concordant genetic
   variation (DGGE banding patterns) in the ITS2 genotypes from Belize,
   Panama and Colombia. ITS1-5.8S-ITS2 phylogenetic analysis afforded
   evidence for considering the species P. kallos (Bielschowsky) as the
   shallow-most morphotype of P. bipinnata from exposed environments. The
   population from Carrie Bow Cay, Belize (1-45 m) was examined to
   determine the phenotypic integration of modular features such as branch
   thickness, polyp aperture, interpolyp distance, internode length and
   branch length. Third-order partial correlation coefficients suggested
   significant integration between polypar and colonial traits. Some
   features did not change at all despite 10-fold differences in other
   integrated features. More importantly, some colonial features showed
   dependence on modular features. Conclusion: Consequently, module
   integration in gorgonian corals can be shifted, switched or canalized
   along lineages. Modular marine organisms such as corals are variations
   on a single theme: their modules can couple or decouple, allowing them
   to adapt to all marine benthic environments.

   different food materials. A high proportion of baits were taken the day
   of placement with minimal disturbance by nontarget species. DuPont Oil
   Blue A(TM) dye was an effective short-term biomarker for use in baits;
   based on its subsequent detection in mongooses, some of the population
   had consumed and not cached or discarded baits. Central point baiting
   stations showed promise as an alternative delivery technique.

   coordinated investigation of biodiversity in the Pelican Cays, we
   sampled fishes using a combination of small rotenone stations and visual
   censuses. The Pelican Cays are part of a structurally defined larger
   group called the Rhomboidal Cays. We have records of 193 species of
   fishes from the Rhomboidal Cays, 168 from the Core Pelican Cays and 123
   from the Peripheral Rhomboidal Cays. By contrast, 293 species are known
   from the Offshore Banks, 339 from the Barrier Reef, 106 from the
   Mid-Shelf area exclusive of the Peripheral Rhomboidal Cays, and 150 from
   the Coastal Marine region, a total of 497 from the entire region. Twelve
   wide-ranging species recorded from the Pelican Cays have not been found
   in the other nearby areas. An undescribed species of wrasse, Halichoeres
   sp., is known only from the Rhomboidal Cays, and an undescribed
   serranid, Hypoplectrus sp., is abundant in the Pelican Cays, with a
   single record from Wee-Wee Cay. Other special features of the Pelican
   Cays are the conspicuous absence of some common species, such as the
   bluehead wrasse, Thalassoma bifasciatum, and differences in habitat of
   the blenny Acanthemblemaria aspera.

AB Benthic-pelagic coupling and the role of bottom-up versus top-down
   processes are recognized as having a major impact on the community
   structure of intertidal and shallow subtidal marine Communities.
   Bottom-up processes, however, are still viewed as principally affecting
   the outcome of top-down processes. Sponges on coral reefs are important
   members of the benthic community and provide a crucial coupling between
   water-column productivity and the benthos. Other than scleractinian
   corals, sponges dominate many of these habitats where water column
   productivity is composed of mostly autotrophic and heterotrophic
   picoplankton that sponges actively filter. While predation upon sponges
   by invertebrates, fish, and turtles occurs, the sponges Callyspongia
   vaginalis, Agelas conifera, and Aplysina fistularis from Florida,
   Belize, and the Bahamas, respectively, exhibit a consistent and
   significant pattern of greater biomass, rates of growth, and feeding, as
   does their food supply, with increasing depth. sponges consume 65-93% of
   the available particulate food supply and, at all sites, sponges
   increase in size and growth rate as depth increases, suggesting that
   food supply and, therefore, bottom-up processes significantly influence
   the distribution and abundance of sponges in these habitats. (c) 2005

AB Annual rainfall in the Caribbean exhibits a bimodal structure with two
   rainfall maxima (May-June and September-October) separated by what has
   been termed a mid-summer drought (MSD) (July-August). Despite general
   acceptance of the intensification and expansion of the North Atlantic
   High Pressure (NAHP) as the cause of the Caribbean MSD, it has been
   noted in several studies that the influence of the NAHP may not be
   consistent across the region. The purpose of this research is to better
   understand the Caribbean MSD by mapping the spatial co-variability of
   the Caribbean MSD and then determining the association between these
   spatial patterns and NAHP circulation. The spatial variability of the
   Caribbean MSD is identified through mapping of Principal Component
   Analysis (PCA) loadings of Caribbean MSD season rainfall time series. A
   correlation analysis was completed between monthly MSD region rainfall
   time series and measures of the NAHP to assess the degree of association
   between the spatial variability in the Caribbean MSD and NAHP
   circulation. The PICA identified six MSD regions, the northwestern
   Caribbean, the interior Caribbean, the eastern rim Caribbean, Coro
   Venezuela, Grantley Barbados, and a transition zone. The spatial pattern
   of the MSD regions suggests that the NAHP impacts the eastern Caribbean
   first and then progresses westward as the summer develops. In regard to
   the association between NAHP circulation and MSD region precipitation
   time series, correlation analysis indicates that overall, a modified
   Bermuda High Index (BHI) is a more effective tool in evaluating the
   association between the NAHP and Caribbean MSD as compared to the
   traditional indices, NAO EOF and BHI. Lagged correlations support
   previous findings that the winter preceding a particularly dry summer in
   the Caribbean is characterized by a strong pressure gradient on the
   southeastern flank of the NAHP; implying stronger Trade Winds, cooler
   sea surface temperatures, and reduced convective rainfall. Copyright (c)

AB It has been proposed that indigenous societies can be models for the
   conservation of biodiversity. However, attempts at implementing
   conservation-based development plans are being judged failures. In this
   article, I argue that these failures can be addressed by translating
   indigenous knowledge into context that is mutually intelligible to both
   indigenous people and conservation biologists. Drawing on sixteen months
   of ethnobiological fieldwork, this article uses indigenous knowledge to
   describe the relationship of traditional life to biodiversity for the
   Hewa of Papua New Guinea's Central Range. The island of New Guinea is
   one of the planet's last bastions of cultural and biological diversity.
   Using birds as an indicator of diversity, I argue that more productive
   conservation policies will emerge when indigenous activities are viewed
   not as vehicles for establishing equilibrium with the environment, but
   as a source of ecological disturbance. Although Hewa traditions
   currently play a significant role in shaping this biologically diverse
   environment, their lifestyle is not necessarily a template for
   sustainability in the future.

AB The impacts of coastal development on survival and swimming success were
   investigated for hatchling hawksbill turtles (Eretmochelys imbricata)
   swimming away from artificially lighted and dark nesting beaches in
   Barbados. The overall predation rate was 6.9%. Predation rates were not
   significantly affected by offshore substrate type or beachfront
   lighting. However, of those hatchlings leaving lighted beaches that
   successfully escaped predation, a significantly smaller percentage
   (32.9%) were able to swim the prescribed distance seawards during the
   observation period. Moonlight significantly improved the swimming
   success of hatchlings leaving lighted beaches, particularly when the
   moon was full, but also significantly influenced predation rates, which
   were highest during the full moon (12.6%). Some hatchlings released from
   dark beaches were attracted by lights from neighbouring beaches, which
   only became visible after they were a substantial distance from shore.
   Artificial light may override the effects of wave cues in the low wave
   energy conditions characteristic of leeward Caribbean beaches, making
   swimming hawksbill hatchlings especially vulnerable to the effects of
   beachfront lighting. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Although flying foxes (fruit bats in the genus Pteropus) in continental
   forests often fly between scattered resources, little is known about
   their ranging behavior among islands. The inhospitable water matrix that
   surrounds the food patches (islands) in archipelagos may prevent flying
   foxes from tracking resources as efficiently as their counterparts on
   larger landmasses do. Our aim in this study was to determine whether the
   abundance of foraging flying foxes (Pteropus tonganus) reflected food
   availability on islands in the Vava'u archipelago of Tonga, regardless
   of island size and isolation. Overall, food availability was the
   strongest determinant of flying fox abundance, and spatial aspects of
   the islands (land area within 10 km) had only a small influence. Food
   availability appears to regulate flying fox abundance only when food
   resources are low, but when food sources are plentiful, flying fox
   abundance may be high or low. These results provide indirect evidence
   that flying foxes are able to track food resources efficiently in an
   archipelago, and the water matrix that surrounds the food patches
   (islands) is not a strong deterrent for foraging animals.

AB The diversification of Indo-Pacific marine fauna has long captivated the
   attention of evolutionary biologists. Previous studies have mainly
   focused on coral reef or shallow water-associated taxa. Here, we present
   the first attempt to reconstruct the evolutionary historyphylogeny,
   diversification, and biogeographyof a deep-water lineage. We sequenced
   the molecular markers 16S, COI, ND1, 18S, and 28S for nearly 80% of the
   nominal species of the squat lobster genus Paramunida. Analyses of the
   molecular phylogeny revealed an accelerated diversification in the late
   OligoceneMiocene followed by a slowdown in the rate of lineage
   accumulation over time. A parametric biogeographical reconstruction
   showed the importance of the southwest Pacific area, specifically the
   island arc of Fiji, Tonga, Vanuatu, Wallis, and Futuna, for
   diversification of squat lobsters, probably associated with the global
   warming, high tectonic activity, and changes in oceanic currents that
   took place in this region during the OligoceneMiocene period. These
   results add strong evidence to the hypothesis that the Neogene was a
   period of major diversification for marine organisms in both shallow and
   deep waters.

AB Vision is a remarkable sensory adaptation; however, natural selection
   may not favor maintenance of eye function in habitats where eyesight
   does not contribute to fitness. Vision loss is relatively common in
   cave-dwelling spiders in the temperate zone, but appears rarer in
   tropical caves. To date, blind spiders in the (sub)tropical Caribbean
   have only been described from Cuba and Jamaica, including four pholcids,
   a barychelid, a ctenid, and a prodidomid with reduced eyes. In our
   survey of over 40 caves in the Greater Antilles, mainly Puerto Rico,
   Isla Mona, Cuba, and Dominican Republic, we have not previously found
   any eyeless spiders. Here we summarize information on blind Caribbean
   spiders, and describe two newly discovered species representing two
   families, from a single cave, Cueva Seibo, in the Dominican Republic.
   These are the eyeless Ciba seibo n. gen., n. sp. (Ctenidae) and the
   vestigial-eyed Trichopebna maddeni n. sp. (Barychelidae). Cueva Seibo
   appears to be an energy-poor system with a relatively small bat
   population and is physiologically unique amongst caves we surveyed. We
   postulate that troglobiomorphism in the Caribbean may result from
   individual cave environments and hypothesize convergent eye loss within
   this cave, as most members of both families, including epigean species
   from the Dominican Republic, have normal eyes. However, another blind
   species, Ciba calzada (Alayon 1985) n. comb., occurs in a cave in Cuba
   and it remains to be tested if eye loss occurred in these two
   convergently, or if their shared lack of eyes is homologous.

AB In Papua New Guinea, the fate of forests is governed by forest-dwelling
   tribal societies. A rapidly increasing pace of logging compels us to ask
   why tribal communities prefer logging to conservation. In the absence of
   feasible development opportunities, remote communities become quickly
   enthusiastic about conservation projects, but once an area is opened up
   to logging few such projects survive. Direct payments to forest owners
   to cover the costs of missed opportunities for economic development are
   advocated here to make conservation competitive. A conservation royalty
   scheme would deliver a higher proportion of the conservation funds to
   the resource owners than the management-intensive community development
   projects currently favored. Such an approach requires a profound
   cultural change within conservation organizations from a 'development
   aid' approach to one more oriented toward business.

AB Coconut fibre/huskfilters can be appropriate in handling high turbid
   stormwaters without becoming quickly clogged. This low impact type
   filter can "polish" stormwater removing high turbidity and contaminants.
   Three filter units were constructed and tested at the University of
   Trinidad and Tobago for urban runoff recycling and non-potable supply to
   improve water sanitation and reduce the risk of flooding. The filter
   utilised local materials that are both widely available and inexpensive
   enough to discard after use eliminating back-washing. The accumulated
   water quality data measured inflow and outflow parameters. The removal
   of the particulates was measured against the local and international
   water quality standards. Experimental results showed that the coconut
   fibre/huskfilters achieved results equal to conventional sand-gravel
   media filters. There were no significant differences between the
   filtration techniques which showed that the coconut husks/fibre filter
   can treat stormwaters of high turbidity (usually the case for the
   southern Caribbean).

AB Motivation: Past sea level fluctuations have shaped island area and
   archipelago configuration. The availability of global high-resolution
   data on bathymetry and past sea levels allows reconstruction of island
   palaeo-geography. Studies on the role of palaeo-area often consider only
   the Last Glacial Maximum, which neglects the dynamics of island fusion
   and fission resulting from cyclic sea level fluctuations throughout the
   Quaternary. Currently, no global database is available to test the role
   of changing island geographies driven by Quaternary sea level change on
   evolutionary, ecological and archaeological patterns. However, data on
   island palaeo-environments is crucial for understanding insular
   biodiversity distributions and human settlement patterns. Here, we
   present the Palaeo-Islands and Archipelago Configuration (PIAC)
   database, containing sea level-driven palaeo-geography changes over the
   late Quaternary of 178 islands in 27 archipelagos, and discuss its
   relevance, limitations and uncertainties. The R functions developed to
   create the PIAC database are provided to allow calculations for other
   islands, time steps, sea-level curves and higher spatio-temporal
   resolutions.
   Main types of variables contained: Polygon shapefiles with archipelago
   configuration and tables with palaeo-area per island.
   Spatial location and grain: The database has a global representation,
   with 27 archipelagos being covered: Aldabra, Azores, Balearic Islands,
   California Channel Islands, Canary Islands, Cape Verde, Comoros, Cook
   Islands, Crozet Islands, Dutch Caribbean, Galapagos, Gulf of Guinea,
   Hawaii, Inner Seychelles, Juan Fernandez, Kuril Islands, Madeira,
   Marianas, Marquesas, Mascarenes, Phoenix Islands, Pitcairn Islands,
   Prince Edward Islands, Revillagigedo, Samoan Islands, Society Islands
   and Tristan da Cunha. All data are at 1 km(2) spatial resolution.
   Time period and grain: The focus of this paper is on the last 35 kyr;
   data for the last 140 kyr are also provided. The grain is 1 kyr temporal
   resolution.
   Level of measurement: Data are per island, grouped per archipelago.
   Software format: The data were produced in the R programming language.

AB Waters from the South Equatorial Current (SEC), the northern branch of
   the South Pacific subtropical gyre, are a major supply of heat to the
   equatorial warm pool, and have an important contribution to climate
   variability and ENSO which motivated the Southwest Pacific Ocean and
   Climate Experiment (SPICE, CLIVAR/WCRP). Initially a broad westward
   current extending from the equator to 30 S, the SEC splits upon arriving
   at the major islands and archipelagoes of Fiji (18 S, 180 E), Vanuatu
   (16 S, 168 E), and New Caledonia (22 S, 165 E), resulting in a complex
   system of western boundary currents and zonal jets that feed the Coral
   and Solomon Seas. We focus here on the formation of one specific jet
   feeding the Coral Sea, the North Caledonian Jet (NCJ). Using a
   combination of recent oceanographic cruises, we describe the ocean
   circulation to the northeast of New Caledonia, where the SEC forms a
   western boundary current that ultimately becomes the NCJ. This current,
   which we document for the first time and propose to refer to as the East
   Caledonian Current (ECC), has its core located 10-100 km off the east
   coast of New Caledonia, and extends vertically to at least 1000 m depth.
   Water mass properties show continuous westward transports through the
   ECC, from the SEC to the NCJ in both the South Pacific Tropical Waters
   in the thermocline and Antarctic Intermediate Waters near 700 m depth.
   The ECC extends about 100 km horizontally; its average 0-1000 m
   transport was estimated at 14.5 +/- 3 Sv off the north tip of the New
   Caledonian reef, with a maximum of 20 Sv in May 2010. South of that the
   upstream branch of the ECC east of the Loyalty is close to 8 Sv
   suggesting an important additional contribution from central Pacific
   waters carried by the SEC at 16 degrees S and diverted to our region
   through the western boundary current system east of Vanuatu. (C) 2011

AB Saint Vincent and the Grenadines conjures up images of a yachting haven
   and a quiet tourists' paradise. The conflicting demands of a growing
   population, a middle-income economy dominated by fishing, plantation
   agriculture and tourism, and environmental and social concerns, all
   contribute to marine stress on the limited, precious, but
   internationally important resources. While the vision exists to manage
   effectively coastal and offshore resources, the institutional, financial
   and social capital to achieve that vision is limited. Development of the
   fledgling partnerships between local communities, national governmental
   structures and the international research, government and donor
   organisations seems the best hope to conserve the environment and
   coastal livelihoods of the islands. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All

AB We present results from the first zonal transect of iron, aluminum, and
   manganese conducted from the western source region of the Equatorial
   Undercurrent (EUC) to the central equatorial Pacific. Trace metals were
   elevated along the slope of Papua New Guinea and within the New Guinea
   Coastal Undercurrent (NGCU), which is the primary Southern Hemisphere
   entry path of water to the EUC. Subsurface maxima in total acid-soluble
   iron, aluminum, and manganese were evident in the EUC. These maxima were
   generally greatest in the western equatorial Pacific and decreased in
   magnitude eastward. Maxima in iron and aluminum persisted to 140 degrees
   W; maxima in manganese extended to 175 degrees W. Iron and manganese
   maxima were deeper (25-75 m) than aluminum maxima and located in the
   lower EUC, which undergoes less interior ocean mixing than shallower
   waters. The depth of the aluminum subsurface maxima correlated strongly
   (r = 0.88) with the depth of the EUC velocity maximum. Surface waters
   were enriched in aluminum and manganese offshore of Papua New Guinea.
   Surface metal concentrations decreased eastward throughout the western
   warm pool up to the longitude (similar to 180 degrees W) of the salinity
   front. Detrital sediment input from either direct riverine input or
   sediment resuspension appeared to be the primary mechanism of supplying
   metals to the NGCU. We estimated eastward fluxes of metals in the EUC
   and found greatest fluxes in the western equatorial Pacific between 160
   E and 165 degrees E, except for aluminum. Fluxes of aluminum and, to a
   lesser extent, manganese increased concurrently with water volume
   transport in the central equatorial Pacific. Iron transport in the EUC
   remained constant east of the dateline, apparently due to the combined
   effects of dilution by meridional entrainment and scavenging. Iron was
   mobilized in a highly active western boundary current region and
   transported eastward in the lower EUC.

   area for the Korean tuna purse seine fleet consisted of the waters of
   Micronesia, Papua New Guinea and Solomon Islands and adjacent high seas
   between 130oE-180o. The center of the Korean tuna fishing ground was in
   the vicinity of 180o during the El-Nino event but was formed in
   150o-160oE during the La-Nina event. As compared with other major purse
   seine fleets in WCPO, the Korean fleet set more on unassociated schools
   of tuna, while Japan, USA and Chinese-Taipei fleets accounted for more
   than 50% of sets on log-associated schools. In general, CPUEs for
   log-associated schools were higher than those for unassociated schools
   and catch composition showed that yellowfin ratio was higher in
   unassociated shools than log-associated schools. Length frequency
   represented higher percentage of mid-sized yellowfin than Japanese and
   USA fleets. Daily set numbers and CPUE were high before 7 am and
   remained almost constant from 7 am to 3 pm but decreased rapidly after 3
   pm and 5 pm, respectively. Catch compostion per set indicated that pure
   skipjack school was caught most frequently, followed by mixed school and
   pure yellowfin school as the least, but CPUE was highest for the mixed
   school.

AB The Island of New Guinea is renowned for its high biodiversity, which
   arises in part from its complex geology and topographical variability.
   The island is, however, relatively understudied. We surveyed forest
   plant communities in the poorly studied Naoro-Brown catchment of the
   West Koiari region of Papua New Guinea. We identified four forest
   types-riverine successional forest, lower montane forest, hill forest,
   and riverine mixed forest-along a 13-km transect, and examined forest
   structure (tree height, stand density, and biomass) and tree species
   diversity (species richness, Shannon-Wiener diversity index, and
   composition) in these forest types. We also assessed the effect of local
   topography on floristic patterns. Forest structure and species diversity
   varied greatly among the forest types, with topography strongly
   affecting species assemblages. These results suggest that highly varied
   landscapes may contain high beta diversity via intense segregation and
   establishment of varied vegetation communities. Beta diversity in New
   Guinea may be higher than expected as such highly varied landscapes are
   common, yet poorly studied. To effectively conserve biodiversity in New
   Guinea's forests, protection must include forested landscapes that best
   represent the topographical variability throughout the island to account
   for locally endemic species restricted to specific ecological niches.

AB In this review, I look at governance beyond the national level and
   consider how well island conservation issues are addressed in
   international conventions and agreements, both global and regional. I
   focus primarily on small island developing states (SIDS) and look at
   conventions to which they are parties, in which their needs are
   specifically mentioned and which have actions directly targeted to SIDS.
   I also discuss the evolution of international soft law in agreements and
   action plans to respond to island issues, the role of the secretariats
   that have been set up by international conventions to support SIDS
   conservation action and the protection and recognition provided to
   island protected areas listed under international conventions. The
   review shows that international governance has increasingly responded to
   island needs for biodiversity conservation, often with the active
   participation of SIDS themselves. However, the multiplication of
   international agreements and their requirements has often surpassed the
   capacity of island countries to implement them, requiring further
   adaptations in order to address this problem. The regional organizations
   of SIDS help to provide an interface with global conventions and
   international organizations. There remain a number of gaps and
   challenges that still need to be addressed in order to halt the erosion
   and hopefully encourage the restoration of island biodiversity.

AB This study presents the first comprehensive genetic analyses of common
   bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops truncatus) based on mitochondrial DNA and
   microsatellite loci in the Wider Caribbean. Live captures of bottlenose
   dolphins have been occurring since the turn of the 20th century in Wider
   Caribbean waters where little is known about their population structure
   and genetic diversity. In this study, blood or tissue samples were
   obtained from stranded or captive dolphins from nine geographic regions.
   One hundred fifty-eight sequences of the mitochondrial DNA control
   region and nine microsatellite loci were analyzed and compared with
   previously published sequences. This study revealed the presence of
   inshore ecotype and worldwide distributed form haplotypes of bottlenose
   dolphins in Wider Caribbean waters. At the mitochondrial level, genetic
   differentiation between these two groups was significant (FST?=?0.805,
   P?<?0.001). Analyses of mitochondrial DNA sequences at a wider
   geographic level revealed three genetically differentiated (FST?=?0.254,
   FST?=?0.590, P?<?0.001) population units: Puerto Rico,
   Cuba/Colombia/Bahamas/Mexico, and Honduras. There was evidence of low
   female-mediated gene flow among these population units (Nmf?=?1.46).
   Microsatellite analyses identified four somewhat different population
   units: Honduras/Colombia/Puerto Rico, Bahamas, Cuba and Mexico. The
   presence of worldwide distributed form and inshore ecotype haplotypes in
   particular population units, may be causing differences in the
   population structure pattern showed by each molecular marker. Decreased
   observed heterozygosity and three loci out of the HardyWeinberg
   equilibrium were found in the Honduras/Colombia/Puerto Rico population
   unit suggesting a Wahlund effect. The genetic differentiation and
   divergence between the two forms identified in this study must be taken
   into consideration for captive programs that aim to reproduce bottlenose
   dolphins from this region. Although genetic diversity at the
   mitochondrial and microsatellite level in these dolphins seems to be
   relatively high, additional demographic and abundance data must be
   obtained before more captures are allowed.

AB Three new species of Cumacea are described from Costa Rican coastal
   waters. The bodotriids, Cyclaspys breedyae n. sp. and Cyclaspis vargasae
   n. sp., occurred on the Pacific coast, and the nannastacid, Cumella
   spinifera n. sp., came from a shallow back reef habitat of the Caribbean
   coast. Cyclaspis breedyae n. sp., which was collected from shallow water
   (1-1.5 m) at a beach just north of Puerto Caldera, has affinities with
   Cyclaspis varians Calman, 1912 from the northwestern Atlantic; it
   differs by having a carapace with fewer ( usually 4), but larger, dorsal
   spines behind the ocular lobe and by having the pseudorostrum not
   extending beyond the ocular lobe. Cyclaspis vargasae n. sp., which was
   collected at a depth of 35 m off San Jose Island on the northwest coast,
   has some similarities with western Atlantic species, Cyclaspis alba
   Roccatagliata & Moreira 1986 and C. variabilis Roccatagliata & Moreira,
   1986, but it differs from these species by having a carapace with
   oblique dorsal crests and a lateral ridge running anteriorly from the
   posteroventral margin of the carapace to just above the antennal notch.
   Cumella spinifera n. sp. was collected on the Caribbean coast at Puerto
   Vargas and has its closest affinities with C. zimmeri Petrescu, Iliffe,
   & Sarbu, 1994, known from shallow Caribbean waters off Jamaica. It is
   distinguished from the Jamaican species by several characters, including
   having the female carapace with more dorsal spines ( 10 verses 3 on the
   carapace of C. zimmeri) and being more dorsally pronounced with a
   papulate integument.

AB Marine pollution and coastal degradation have become serious development
   issues in the Caribbean. Early evidence of marine pollution was mainly
   anecdotal, but within the last 10-15 years, work conducted by
   universities and research institutions in the Region has provided the
   beginnings of a database that identifies several common marine pollution
   problems. The United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP), the
   Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission (IOC) and the Pan American
   World Health Organization (PAHO/WHO) have also been instrumental in
   co-ordinating several marine pollution studies. In the English-speaking
   Caribbean, the University of the West Indies, the Institute of Marine
   Affairs in Trinidad and Tobago, and the Caribbean Environmental Health
   Institute located in St Lucia, have taken a lead role in identifying
   marine pollution problems in their Sub-Region. For the Wider Caribbean a
   database for petroleum pollution and marine debris has been developed.
   Land-based sources of marine pollution have been identified as a major
   problem, with several 'hot spots' identified in mainland countries and
   in some of the larger industrialised islands. Organic and nutrient
   pollution, particularly from sewage, is most widespread and is possibly
   the most serious marine pollution problem in the Caribbean. A lack of
   capital investment funds to install the appropriate infrastructure to
   deal with sewage and other liquid effluents is a major stumbling block
   to solving the problem of marine pollution in the Caribbean. Other
   factors include political will and administrative and legal structures
   to regulate human development activities.

AB Although the bottlenose dolphin Tursiops truncatus is one of the most
   common cetacean species around Sao Tome Island, Gulf of Guinea, little
   research has focused on this species in this region. This study
   investigated the population of bottlenose dolphins around Sao Tome
   Island by estimating the minimum population size, site fidelity and
   social structure. During a total of 226 surveys between 2002 and 2006,
   and in 2012, 51 sightings were recorded but only 33 had photographic
   data suitable for rigorous analysis. The minimum annual total population
   size, based on permanently marked dolphins, was 37 individuals, and the
   discovery curve indicated that a large part of the population remained
   undiscovered. The annual sighting rate for 76 highly distinctive adult
   animals ranged from 0.20 (seen in one year only) to 1.0 (seen every year
   of the study period). Resighted individuals demonstrated low association
   values; the dolphins seemed to form a single group with a fluid
   structure.

AB The principal etiologic agent of human eosinophilic meningitis,
   Angiostrongylus cantonensis, was first detected in rats in Canton, China
   in 1933. The first human case was detected on Taiwan in 1944. Epidemic
   outbreaks were noted on Ponape (E. Caroline Is.) from 1944 to 1948. The
   disease may present as transient meningitis or a more severe disease
   involving the brain, spinal cord and nerve roots, with a characteristic
   eosinophilia of the peripheral blood and CSF. Since 1961 it has been
   known that human infections are usually acquired by purposeful or
   accidental ingestion of infective larvae in terrestrial mollusks,
   planaria and fresh-water crustacea. There is no effective specific
   treatment. The African land snail, Achatina fulica played an important
   role in the panpacific dispersal of the organism: it will be important
   in Africa in the future as well. Rats were, and will continue to be the
   principal agents of expansion of the parasite beyond the Indopacific
   area. During and just after WWII the parasite was introduced, and/or
   spread passively from South and Southeast Asia into the Western Pacific
   islands and eastward and southward through Micronesia, Melanesia,
   Australia and into Polynesia, sequestered in shipments of war material
   and facilitated by post-war commerce. In the 1950s numerous cases were
   identified for the first time on Sumatra, the Philippines, Taiwan,
   Saipan, New Caledonia, and as far east as Rarotonga and Tahiti. Then
   cases were detected in Vietnam, Thailand, Cambodia, Java, Sarawak, the
   New Hebrides, Guam and Hawaii during the 1960s. Subsequently in the
   Pacific Basin the disease has appeared on Okinawa, other Ryukyu islands,
   Honshu, Kyushu, New Britain, American Samoa and Western Samoa,
   Australia, Hong Kong, Bombay, India, Fiji and most recently in mainland
   China. The parasite in rats now occurs throughout the Indopacific Basin
   and littoral. Beyond the Indopacific region, the worm has been found in
   rodents in Madagascar (ca 1963), Cuba (1973), Egypt (1977), Puerto Rico
   (1984), New Orleans, Louisiana (1985) and Port Harcourt, Nigeria (1989).
   Human infections have now been detected in Cuba (1973), Reunion Island
   (1974) and Cote d'Ivoire (1979) and should be anticipated wherever
   infected rats or mollusks have been introduced. Caged primates became
   infected in zoos in Hong Kong (1978) and New Orleans and Nassau, Bahamas
   (1987). The use of mollusks and crustacea as famine foods, favored
   delicacies and medicines has resulted in numerous outbreaks and isolated
   infections. Economic and political instability, illicit trade,
   unsanitary peridomestic conditions and lack of health education promote
   the local occurrence and insidious global expansion of parasitic
   eosinophilic meningitis. The penetration of this host-parasite system
   into the tropical and subtropical areas of Africa, the Indian
   subcontinent, the Caribbean and the temperate Gulf Coast region of the
   United States is of considerable public health importance.

   around the outer barrier of the coral reefs off the Belize mainland. A
   total of 1,529 individuals representing 52 species were collected.
   Species distribution patterns were controlled mainly by sediment type
   and the presence or absence of mangroves. Six species (Phallodrilus
   molestus, Tubificoides bermudae, Inanidrilus leukodermatus, Heterodrilus
   flexuosus, Bathydrilus formosus, Smithsonidrilus hummelincki) with
   diverse life history characteristics were common and had broad habitat
   preferences being found in various types of heterogeneous sandy
   sediments. Heterodrilus flexuosus was the only common species in these
   samples known only in Belize. The other five common species range from
   Belize to Florida or Bermuda. Most other species have narrower habitat
   preferences and are limited to specific habitats. For example, one group
   of gutless species was restricted to organically enriched fine to medium
   sands, a group of Limnodriloidinae occurred only in mud around mangrove
   cays, and a group of meiofaunal species were restricted to saline
   groundwater.

AB Some atmospheric properties in the Pacific and Caribbean marine basins
   close to the Central American Isthmus and their possible
   interconnections are analized, based on a statistical study. The band
   describing southern Nicaragua is taken as reference, because it has the
   least orographic features that may disturbe the Trade winds flowing from
   the northwest (NW) and from the southeast (SE). The atmospheric
   properties are associated to the incidence of synoptic phenomena like
   tropical cyclones and their probability of crossing the Isthmus with
   minimun energy loss. The warm El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) events
   produced a systematic weakening of sporadic cyclone type events in the
   western Atlantic, while in the eastern Pacific, because of surface water
   temperatures higher than 27 degrees C, they are reinforced. During the
   transition from warm-ENSO to cold-ENSO events, there are
   interconnections between both oceanic basin with cyclonic systems
   crossing the Isthmus, mainly across the Nicaragua depression (from the
   Atlantic to the Pacific); and with only one case, through Tehuantepec
   (from the Pacific to the Atlantic). During the cold-ENSO events, similar
   conditions to the transition stage can be expected; i.e., the number of
   events increased in the Atlantic Basin while in the Pacific they are
   reduced.

AB Despite the Central Indo-Pacific (CIP) and the Indonesian Archipelago
   being a well-known region of coral reef biodiversity, particularly in
   the 'Coral Triangle', little published information is available on its
   zoantharians (Cnidaria: Hexacorallia: Zoantharia). In order to provide a
   basis for future research on the Indo-Pacific zoantharian fauna and
   facilitate comparisons between more well-studied regions such as Japan
   and the Great Barrier Reef, this report deals with CIP zoantharian
   specimens in the Naturalis collection in Leiden, the Netherlands; 106
   specimens were placed into 24 morpho-species and were supplemented with
   88 in situ photographic records from Indonesia, the Philippines, and
   Papua New Guinea. At least nine morpho-species are likely to be
   undescribed species, indicating that the region needs more research in
   order to properly understand zoantharian diversity within the CIP. The
   Naturalis' zoantharian specimens are listed by species, as well as all
   relevant collection information, and in situ images are provided to aid
   in future studies on zoantharians in the CIP.

AB A conservation assessment for the three cycad species native to the
   Bahamas Islands is presented. Results are based on field surveys on all
   islands where these species occur. Zamia angustifolia is native to
   Eleuthera, Zamia integrifolia is native to Abaco, Andros, Eleuthera,
   Grand Bahama and New Providence, and Zamia lucayana is endemic to Long
   Island. Z. angustifolia is of the highest conservation concern because
   of the small number of adult plants, its restricted distribution and the
   extensive development occurring within its habitat. Z. integrifolia also
   has a restricted distribution on Eleuthera and Grand Bahama and,
   although threatened by urban development in New Providence, it is
   relatively common on Abaco and Andros. Z. lucayana comprises three
   populations within a narrow strip of land of c. 1 km(2); we propose a
   reassignment of its current conservation status from Endangered to
   Critically Endangered. We assessed the genetic structure of Z. lucayana
   based on 15 polymorphic microsatellite DNA loci; this indicated that the
   three known populations should be considered a single management unit.
   However, the high number of private alleles suggests that genetic drift,
   indicative of recent fragmentation, is progressing. We propose in situ
   conservation strategies, and we also collected germplasm from a total of
   24 populations of these three cycad species, for ex situ conservation.

AB Between 1998 and 2001 the deaths of 16 Surinamese children were recorded
   along the Maroni River, which forms the border between Suriname and
   French Guyana. After ametabolic origin was eliminated, ethnobotanical
   research in the field led to a hypothesis of intoxication through the
   ingestion of ackee. Ackee (Blighia sapida) is a large green leafy tree
   of West African origin. Its unripe fruit contains large quantities of
   two toxic molecules: hypoglycin-A and hypoglycin-B, the former being the
   more toxic. We have developed a GC-MS procedure allowing us to
   demonstrate the presence of hypoglycin-A in the gastric fluid of one of
   the deceased children, and to compare the content of hypoglycin-A in
   fruit collected on the road to Paramaribo in Suriname (5.1 mg/g) with
   samples from Burkina Faso (8.1 mg/g) and Jamaica (9.2 mg/g).
   Field research showed the misuse of this little-known plant by Maroon
   witch doctors. The Bushinengue witch doctors were informed about the
   dangers of ackee, and no new cases have been reported to date. (C) 2011

AB The shoaling and final closure of the Central American Seaway (CAS)
   resulted in a major change of the global ocean circulation and has been
   suggested as an essential driver for strengthening of Atlantic
   Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC). The exact timing of CAS
   closure is key to interpreting its importance. Here we present a
   reconstruction of deep and intermediate water Nd and Pb isotope
   compositions obtained from fossil fish teeth and the authigenic coatings
   of planktonic foraminifera in the eastern equatorial Pacific (Ocean
   Drilling Program (ODP) Site 1241) and the Caribbean (ODP Sites 998, 999,
   and 1000) covering the final stages of CAS closure between 5.6 and 2.2
   Ma. The data for the Pacific site indicate no significant
   Atlantic/Caribbean influence over this entire period. The Caribbean
   sites show a continuous trend to less radiogenic Nd isotope compositions
   during the Pliocene, consistent with an enhancement of Upper North
   Atlantic Deep Water (UNADW) inflow and a strengthening of the AMOC.
   Superimposed onto this long-term trend, shorter-term changes of
   intermediate Caribbean Nd isotope signatures approached more UNADW-like
   values during intervals when published reconstructions of seawater
   salinity suggested complete closure of the CAS. The data imply that
   significant deep water exchange with the Pacific essentially stopped by
   7 Ma and that shallow exchange, which still occurred at least
   periodically until approximately 2.5 Ma, may have been linked to the
   strength of the AMOC but did not have any direct effect on the
   intermediate and deep Caribbean Nd isotope signatures through mixing
   with Pacific waters.

AB The dive behavior of gravid leatherback turtles (Dermochelys coriacea)
   was studied during the internesting interval in two western Pacific
   nesting regions: Papua Barat, Indonesia, and the Solomon Islands in
   2006, 2007, and 2010. We used three types of dive data: time-at-depth
   data (Papua Barat: N = 4; Solomon Islands: N = 6), intermittent dive
   data (Papua Barat: N = 6) obtained from ARGOS satellite transmitters,
   and continuous dive data obtained from recovered semi-archival tags
   (Papua Barat: N = 1, Solomon Islands: N = 1). All dive data demonstrated
   that the leatherback turtles routinely dove to deep waters (around 150
   m) throughout the internesting interval. The continuous dive data showed
   that turtles spent 37.3% of their time in routine deep dives and that
   they stayed in cold waters below the thermocline. Fine-scale monitoring
   (1-s interval, 0.5 m of resolution) suggested that these routine deep
   dives were not accompanied with any wiggles (up-and-down undulations in
   the depth profile) or flat-bottom phases, and they reached deep waters
   by gliding, which suggests that these dives may have served to conserve
   energy and/or to thermoregulate. Comparison with the dive behavior in
   other regions (Costa Rica, French Guiana, Grenada, Malaysia, and St.
   Croix) suggests that gravid leatherback turtles in all regions except
   French Guiana assume an energy-saving strategy during the internesting
   interval that involves gliding to or resting on the sea floor in colder
   water. The behavioral tactics (dive patterns) they use, however, differ
   because of bathymetric constraints.

AB Background: Two processes may contribute to the formation of global
   centers of biodiversity: elevated local speciation rates (the center of
   origin hypothesis), and greater accumulation of species formed elsewhere
   (the center of accumulation hypothesis). The relative importance of
   these processes has long intrigued marine biogeographers but rarely has
   been tested.
   Results: To examine how origin and accumulation affected the Greater
   Caribbean center of diversity, we conducted a range-wide survey of mtDNA
   cytochrome b in the widespread Atlantic reef damselfish Chromis
   multilineata (N = 183) that included 10 locations in all four tropical
   Atlantic biogeographic provinces: the Greater Caribbean, Brazil, the
   mid-Atlantic ridge, and the tropical eastern Atlantic. We analyzed this
   data and re-evaluated published genetic data from other reef fish taxa
   (wrasses and parrotfishes) to resolve the origin and dispersal of mtDNA
   lineages. Parsimony networks, mismatch distributions and phylogenetic
   analyses identify the Caribbean population of C. multilineata as the
   oldest, consistent with the center of origin model for the
   circum-Atlantic radiation of this species. However, some Caribbean
   haplotypes in this species were derived from Brazilian lineages,
   indicating that mtDNA diversity has not only originated but also
   accumulated in the Greater Caribbean. Data from the wrasses and
   parrotfishes indicate an origin in the Greater Caribbean in one case,
   Caribbean origin plus accumulation in another, and accumulation in the
   remaining two.
   Conclusion: Our analyses indicate that the Greater Caribbean marine
   biodiversity hotspot did not arise through the action of a single mode
   of evolutionary change. Reef fish distributions at the boundaries
   between Caribbean and Brazilian provinces (the SE Caribbean and NE
   Brazil, respectively) indicate that the microevolutionary patterns we
   detected in C. multilineata and other reef fishes translate into
   macroevolutionary processes and that origin and accumulation have acted
   in concert to form the Greater Caribbean biodiversity hotspot.

AB The Southern Subarea of the Caribbean Sea Large Marine Ecosystem
   encompasses most of the continental and island coasts of Venezuela, as
   well as Trinidad, Tobago, Bonaire, Curacao, Aruba and the northeastern
   continental coast of Colombia in the Caribbean. The subarea is the only
   area of the Caribbean Sea LME (CSLME) with an important upwelling
   process that determines its very high productivity, especially in the
   eastern region of Venezuela. It generates a big impact over the
   ecological conditions of the rest of the Caribbean Sea LME, mainly over
   the biological productivity. However, extreme changes of climatic
   conditions have weakened upwelling in several years during the last two
   decades, with severe consequences in the total fish production of
   Venezuela and the Southern Subarea of the Caribbean Sea Large Marine
   Ecosystem. The crisis of the sardine in Venezuela is perhaps the
   clearest example of it. Another contribution of the Southern Subarea of
   the Caribbean Sea LME is the high biodiversity of marine fauna and flora
   that appears in numerous coral reefs, seagrass meadows and mangroves in
   the region. Unfortunately, several factors threaten the health and
   population sizes of some taxonomic groups. The corals are among the most
   affected, with losses of significant live coral coverage at all the
   reefs of the Southern Subarea, similar to the rest of the Caribbean
   region. Even when the governance of the Southern Subarea of the
   Caribbean Sea LME has many environmental laws and institutions that are
   charged with applying these laws, the latter are not appropriately
   enforced. If this situation does not change, the sustainability of the
   Southern Subarea will be at risk.

AB The biogeographically 'open' nature of marine systems is discussed.
   Narrow endemism is demonstrated in crustacean taxa with planktotrophic
   larvae, as well as in those with benthic recruitment. A close similarity
   is demonstrated between the endemicity on islands of shallow-water
   marine amphipods and that of terrestrial plants. Using comparable
   collecting techniques, the marine amphipod diversity of tropical lagoons
   (in Papua New Guinea and in New Caledonia), with different evolutionary
   histories for c. 60 Ma, was compared. Whilst only about 20% of the
   species were common to the two lagoons, the number of species collected
   and the family species richness was strikingly similar. This suggests
   the existence of evolutionary 'assembly rules'. There is a weak
   correlation between amphipod species richness and family richness for a
   given area. (C) 1997 Academic Press Limited.

   floral distributions clearly show the existence of the Circum-tropical
   Current between the Caribbean and the eastern equatorial Pacific and no
   surface water communication between the northern and southern Caribbean.
   In 10.71-9.36 Ma, the Circum-tropical Current weakened and the northward
   intra-Caribbean current had been initiated. Northern and southern
   Caribbean surface waters again became separated in 8.35-3.65 Ma and the
   Circum-tropical Current was regenerated. After 2.76 Ma, the northward

   Five of them, D. amydriae, D. wauana, D. mucunae, D. spinula and D.
   quadriserrata, appear to be associated with freshly decayed flowers; in
   the other 3 this relationship is uncertain. Among the 4 spp. belonging
   to the subgenus Drosophila, D. spinula frequents many kinds of flowers
   but was bred only from Mucuna and 2 spp. of Ipomoea. This latter host is
   shared by the D. melanogaster group species, D. elegans. D. (S.) hibisci
   was reared from Hibiscus esculentus. New species (37), 23 of which
   belong to the subgenus Scaptodrosophila, have been described. Nine were
   reared from decayed inflorescences. Three more species of this subgenus,
   D. plaua, D. metatarsalis and D. scaptomyzoidea, were bred in such
   sites. Flowers, particularly of monocotyledons, are an important natural
   breeding substrate for flies of the subgenus Scaptodrosophila.

AB The distribution of living planktic foraminifers and their relation to
   the hydrography of the Caribbean Sea was investigated in plankton net
   tows and surface sediment samples taken along the Antilles island arc
   during April/May 1996. The planktic foraminiferal community was strongly
   influenced by spatial variations in salinity that were largely due to
   the influx of Orinoco River water into the southeastern Caribbean Sea
   and inflowing Sargasso Sea water in the north. Along the Antilles island
   arc, Globigerinoides ruber was the dominant species in the surface
   waters throughout. In the southeastern Caribbean Sea, where Orinoco
   River outflow influences the planktic community, standing stocks of
   planktic foraminifers (> 100 mum) between 4 and 50 specimens m(-3) were
   medium to low. The southeastern faunas between Tobago and Guadeloupe
   were characterized by increased proportions of Neogloboquadrina
   dutertrei. Highest standing stocks of 159 specimens m(-3) in the upper
   20 m of the water column were recorded in the northeastern Caribbean Sea
   and the assemblages were characterized by high proportions of
   Globigerinita glutinata, associated with cyclonic eddies. In the Anegada
   Passage, where Sargasso Sea water flows into the Caribbean Sea, low
   standing stocks of 18 specimens m(-3) indicate oligotrophic conditions.
   Together with the oligotrophic surface waters, the Subtropical
   Underwater enters the Caribbean Sea through the Anegada Passage in water
   depths between 100 and 300 m. These waters are characterized by higher
   concentrations of Globorotalia truncatulinoides relative to the adjacent
   water masses. Comparison of the living planktic foraminiferal fauna with
   empty test assemblages from the water column and from surface sediments
   shows that differences in the faunal composition mostly correspond to
   the distribution of water masses and to the differential dissolution of
   species. In the vicinity of islands Globigerinoides ruber reaches higher
   relative frequencies than in the open ocean, pointing towards a higher
   tolerance of this species towards neritic conditions than in other
   species. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The four-wing flyingfish, Hirundichthys affinis, is an epipelagic,
   open-water species found throughout the tropical (central) Atlantic. In
   the central western Atlantic it supports commercially important
   fisheries in three geographically separate areas: the eastern Caribbean
   islands; the southern Netherlands Antilles; and northeast Brazil,
   although the resource remains unmanaged in all three areas and the stock
   structure unresolved. Previous tagging studies of H. affinis, in the
   central western Atlantic indicated very little about the movements of
   flyingfish off northeastern Brazil, but did show that flyingfish move
   freely between the eastern Caribbean islands, although they do not
   appear to travel as far as the southern Netherlands Antilles. However,
   tagging studies only address geographical movement of fish and cannot
   discriminate among genetically discrete stocks. In this study, we use
   mtDNA markers (restriction fragment length polymorphisms [RFLPs] of the
   D-loop region) to examine the genetic variation and its implication for
   the stock structure of flyingfish across the central western Atlantic. A
   total of 360 flyingfish were sampled from the commercial fisheries in
   the three geographical areas between January and August 1995. Sixty fish
   were taken from each of the two spawning populations in Barbados and 60
   from the spawning populations in each of Dominica and Tobago (in the
   eastern Caribbean); 60 from Curacao (in the southern Netherlands
   Antilles); and 60 from Caicara (in Rio Grande do Norte, northeast
   Brazil). The mtDNA D-loop region was amplified using the polymerase
   chain reaction (PCR) method and digested to produce RFLPs using five
   restriction enzymes. Extensive genetic diversity was observed, with
   distinct composite mitotypes being detected for each of the three
   geographical areas, indicating a lack of gene flow between these areas
   and the existence of at least three unit stocks of H. affinis in the
   central western Atlantic. The results of cluster analyses of composite
   mitotype sequence divergence and population sequence divergence, and
   parsimony analysis of composite mitotypes were entirely consistent with
   a 3-stock model. Furthermore, genetic heterogeneity was detected among
   eastern Caribbean populations indicating restricted gene flow even
   within a sub-region and emphasizing the need for more detailed studies
   of flyingfish spawning behaviour. These results contrast with the
   typically low levels of genetic variation reported for oceanic pelagic
   species, and for other marine species (reef fish, spiny lobster, queen
   conch) in the Caribbean and indicate that major ocean current patterns
   are not good predictors of gene flow for all species. The implications
   for management of the flying-fish resource in the central western
   Atlantic are that three independent stock assessments and management
   strategies would be appropriate; and that management of the eastern
   Caribbean stock will need to be at a regional level since the stock is
   shared between the different island states, while management of the
   southern Netherlands Antilles stock and the northeast Brazil stock could
   be at a national level.

AB Rainwater harvesting is a well-established practice in many parts of the
   world. In the right environment it can provide a convenient, inexpensive
   and sustainable source of potable water. This study explored rainwater
   collecting system use within rural Trinidadian communities. Data
   regarding participants' demographic details, water practices, health-
   and water-related beliefs were collected from six separate regions late
   in 2009 using a purpose designed questionnaire. The findings, obtained
   from the 1,523 study participants resident in 292 households were
   analysed. Almost half (130) of the participating households utilised
   rainwater as their main supply although some found it necessary to
   switch to alternative sources during dry periods. The majority of
   participants (478) who harvested rainwater were very satisfied with the
   quality of their water and relatively few (212) were concerned that it
   may pose a risk to their health. Rainwater harvesting systems are well
   established in Trinidad and are well accepted by those who use them.
   Further research is needed to establish why more households do not adopt
   this technology as alternative sources remain inconsistent and
   inadequate in many respects. These findings will assist individuals and
   government agencies in making informed decisions when planning and
   managing water sources on the island.

   setation of the antennae, uropods and pereopods. It is suggested that
   other small crustacean groups are relatively overlooked in deep-sea
   studies of hydrothermal vents and similarly active cold seep areas,
   where large chemosynthetic vestimentiferan worms or vesicomyid bivalves
   are often the most highly visible organisms present. The ecology of
   deep-sea tanaidaceans is largely unknown but it is likely that most
   species are detrinivores.

AB Multi-species sea cucumber fisheries in Oceania involve vast numbers of
   small-scale fishers exploiting stocks on coral reefs and tropical
   lagoons. Fishery development measures might need to be specific to
   locations or fisher groups, and regulations should be appropriate to
   fishing activities. To understand fishing among countries, locations,
   gender and age, we conducted questionnaire-based interviews of 479 sea
   cucumber fishers in Fiji, Kiribati, New Caledonia and Tonga. Fishers
   included youth and elderly, and the average age within countries was
   36-42 years. Women commonly gleaned sea cucumbers from shallow habitats
   and dived for them in some countries. Although spatially variable, our
   results indicate intense fishing pressure based on high trip frequencies
   and fishing effort. Catch-per-unit-effort (CPUE) differed significantly
   among countries and locations, and fishers on some islands caught high
   numbers of low value species. Young fishers went fishing more often, but
   age did not affect fishing effort and CPUE. Fishers collected a wide
   range of sea cucumbers, and up to 27 species were harvested in Fiji.
   Species composition in catches differed significantly among countries
   and between genders; women usually harvest species typical of shallower
   reef habitats. Fishers tended to view stocks as declining or greatly
   over-exploited. Based on fisher knowledge, recent catch rates for an
   average fishing day have declined by 33-92% across the study countries
   compared to 10+ years in the past. Our study shows that fishing modes,
   catch rates and catch composition in small-scale fisheries can be highly
   context-dependent. Management measures and interventions to support
   fisher livelihoods must consider gender differences and
   location-specific fishing activities. Sharp declines in catch rates over
   time in all countries, fisher perceptions of resource trajectories, and
   a predominance of low-value species in present-day harvests, provide
   strong evidence of widespread over-exploitation. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

AB Background: Cholera continues to be a devastating disease in many
   developing countries where inadequate safe water supply and poor
   sanitation facilitate spread. From July 2009 until late 2011 Papua New
   Guinea experienced the first outbreak of cholera recorded in the
   country, resulting in >15,500 cases and >500 deaths.
   Methods: Using the national cholera database, we analysed the
   spatio-temporal distribution and clustering of the Papua New Guinea
   cholera outbreak. The Kulldorff space-time permutation scan statistic,
   contained in the software package SatScan v9.2 was used to describe the
   first 8 weeks of the outbreak in Morobe Province before cholera cases
   spread throughout other regions of the country. Data were aggregated at
   the provincial level to describe the spread of the disease to other
   affected provinces.
   Results: Spatio-temporal and cluster analyses revealed that the outbreak
   was characterized by three distinct phases punctuated by explosive
   propagation of cases when the outbreak spread to a new region. The lack
   of road networks across most of Papua New Guinea is likely to have had a
   major influence on the slow spread of the disease during this outbreak.
   Conclusions: Identification of high risk areas and the likely mode of
   spread can guide government health authorities to formulate public
   health strategies to mitigate the spread of the disease through
   education campaigns, vaccination, increased surveillance in targeted
   areas and interventions to improve water, sanitation and hygiene.

AB Rivers that drain the tectonically-active, high-relief islands of the
   Indo-Pacific Archipelago contribute disproportionately large amounts of
   water, solutes, organic matter and sediments to the oceans. The
   magnitude of these fluxes is principally related to prodigious amounts
   of precipitation and the steep, mountainous terrain of the islands that
   together cause vast amounts of water to move rapidly through many
   relatively small watersheds. In this study, rainfall and streamflow data
   and a comprehensive set of geochemical and stable isotope data collected
   from the Fly River (the largest river of New Guinea in terms of annual
   flow) are interpreted to constrain the magnitude of carbon fluxes from
   the watershed and the principal sources of carbon to the rivers. Results
   indicate that the export of dissolved carbon from the Fly River
   watershed is primarily dependent on rainfall variability related to the
   reception of moisture from the northern and southern hemispheres at
   different times of the year. Specifically, rainfall amounts (and hence
   the rate of carbon flux via rivers) were higher during the Austral
   summer when the Inter Tropical Convergence Zone is situated directly
   over New Guinea and lower during the period of moisture transport by
   trade-winds from the western Pacific Ocean. Carbon isotope data suggests
   that the primary source of inorganic carbon in the Fly River watershed
   is the dissolution of carbonate minerals by acidity related to biogenic
   soil CO2 although considerable seasonality in delta C-13 values was
   attributed to biological processes that occur within the rivers
   themselves (i.e. the relative amounts of photosynthesis and respiration
   in the aquatic system at different times of the year). Photosynthesis,
   for instance, appears to dominate in the Austral summer whereas
   respiration tends to dominate in the winter. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All

   regularly between June 1977-Feb. 1978. Organic pollution in the form of
   raw and partially treated sewage was evident throughout the estuary and
   has increased in recent years. Marked concentration gradients were
   observed along a transect from the inner estuary to the open ocean.
   Concentrations of micronutrients and BOD [biological O2 demand]
   decreased along the transect, while water transparency, dissolved O2 and
   salinity increased. Suspended particulate material was abundant in
   surface water throughout the estuary and persisted beyond the mouth into
   the ocean.

   described as a new species, Tityus tenuicauda, endemic to Trinidad, and
   more closely related to Tityus arellanoparrai Gonzalez-Sponga 1985 than
   T. discrepans, both from Venezuela. A key to the identification of the
   three species is provided. New records are provided for Ananteris
   cussinii Borelli 1910, Microtityus rickyi Kjellesvig-Waering 1966,
   Tityus clathratus C.L. Koch 1844 and Tityus melanostictus Pocock 1893.
   Specimens of Microtityus collected on Tobago provide evidence for the
   synonymy of Microtityus starri Lourenco & Huber 1999 with M. rickyi.
   Previously unreported ecological observations are presented, including
   the burrowing biology of Broteochactas laui Kjellesvig-Waering 1966, and
   the microhabitat of Chactas raymondhansorum Francke & Boos 1986, which
   is apparently not restricted to water-filled spaces between the leaf

AB Biotic resistance is the idea that native species negatively affect the
   invasion success of introduced species, but whether this can occur at
   large spatial scales is poorly understood. Here we re-evaluated the
   hypothesis that native large-bodied grouper and other predators are
   controlling the abundance of exotic lionfish (Pterois volitans/miles) on
   Caribbean coral reefs. We assessed the relationship between the biomass
   of lionfish and native predators at 71 reefs in three biogeographic
   regions while taking into consideration several cofactors that may
   affect fish abundance, including among others, proxies for fishing
   pressure and habitat structural complexity. Our results indicate that
   the abundance of lionfish, large-bodied grouper and other predators were
   not negatively related. Lionfish abundance was instead controlled by
   several physical site characteristics, and possibly by culling. Taken
   together, our results suggest that managers cannot rely on current
   native grouper populations to control the lionfish invasion.

AB A survey of queen conch (Strombus gigas) populations near Lee Stocking
   Island, Exuma Cays, Bahamas, showed that 74% of all adults were on the
   narrow island shelf adjacent to the Exuma Sound, in 10-18 m of water.
   None were found deeper than 25 m, and relatively few adults were found
   shallower than 10 m. Numbers of juveniles were greatest on the Great
   Bahama Bank and decreased with increasing depth on the island shelf. No
   juveniles were found in shelf regions greater than 15 m in depth.
   Patterns of shell morphology, which were related to growth rates in
   juveniles, suggest that adults that mature on the Great Bahama Bank
   rarely move to deep water, and that the most important sources for
   deep-water stocks are small, nearshore nurseries on the island shelf The
   mostly unfished deep-water populations are probably now the primary
   source of larvae for queen conch in the Exuma Cays. Because virtually
   all of the conch are within the limits of SCUBA diving, it will be
   important to identify and to protect critical nursery habitats for
   reproductive stocks.

   specimens. Reproduction in U. lindahli is typical of that previously
   observed in pennatulids. Fecundity is high, although most of the oocytes
   present are previtellogenic with only a few developing through to
   maximum size at any one time. Some specimens of U. lindahli appear to be

   26-years) living on Kitava island (Papua New Guinea). On Kitava, a
   traditional subsistence lifestyle uninfluenced by Western dietary habits
   is still maintained, but on Atafu the dietary habits have been modified
   by the inclusion of such imported foods as rice, flour, sugar and canned
   meat and fish. The concentrations of zinc and magnesium in hair were
   significantly higher in the Kitava than in the Atafu subjects, whereas
   those of copper were similar in both groups, and those of selenium,
   mercury, lead and cadmium were higher in Atafu subjects. The levels of
   serum copper, magnesium and selenium concentrations in Kitava subjects
   were not so low as to indicate any trace element deficiency. The higher
   hair content of mercury, lead and cadmium found among Atafu subjects
   might be due to consumption of marine foods contaminated with metals,
   consumption of canned foods, or frequent cigarette smoking, though it is
   difficult to single out any specific factor.

AB Azooxanthellate habitat-forming corals develop in deep waters adjacent

   (Colombian Caribbean). This study was carried out to characterize
   biological and geological features of the continental margin where these
   azooxanthellate coral communities flourish. The principal
   habitat-forming corals species found were Madracis myriaster
   (Milne-Edwards and Haime, 1849) and other branching Madracis species.
   These communities rest on sandy mud bottoms over the shelf break, in
   depths ranging from 120-180 m. Madrepora sp., antipatharians, and
   gorgonians were collected directly attached to adjacent limestone
   hardgrounds. The azooxanthellate coral habitats were found on areas of
   irregular topography (channels, small mounds) and nearby sites with
   evidence of benthic mud-gas seepage from beneath the seafloor. Irregular
   topography and gas seeps might be important factors contributing to the
   settlement and accumulation of coral communities, but the mechanisms
   involved are not fully understood. Questions remain pertaining to the
   possible linkage between shallow- and deep-water corals in the Caribbean
   region.

AB A key challenge has been to define and measure "success" in managing
   protected areas. A case study was conducted of efforts to evaluate the
   new protected area management system in Trinidad and Tobago using a
   participatory approach. The aim of the case study was to (1) examine
   whether stakeholder involvement better captures the multi-faceted nature
   of success and (2) identify the role and influence of various
   stakeholder groups in this process. An holistic and systematic framework
   was developed with stakeholder input that facilitated the integration of
   expert and lay knowledge, a broad emphasis on ecological,
   socio-economic, and institutional aspects, and the use of both
   quantitative and qualitative data allowing the evaluation to capture the
   multi-faceted nature and impacts of protected area management. Input
   from primary stakeholders, such as local communities, was critical as
   they have a high stake in protected area outcomes. Secondary and
   external stakeholders, including government agencies, non-governmental
   organizations, academia and the private sector, were also important in
   providing valuable technical assistance and serving as mediators.
   However, a lack of consensus over priorities, politics, and limited
   stakeholder capacity and data access pose significant barriers to
   engaging stakeholders to effectively measure the management success of
   protected areas. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Aim With six new species of subgenus Inseliellum Rubtsov recently
   described, a revised reconstructed phylogeny based on morphology is
   required. Geological history of islands where Inseliellum occurs, plus a
   cladistic analysis and hydrological considerations, provide the basis
   for a reconstructed geographical history of the species.
   Location Inseliellum is widely distributed and occurs in Micronesia,
   Cook Islands and Polynesia. A single specimen is known from Tonga
   Islands.
   Methods Maximum parsimony criteria using PAUP*, plus cytological
   information, were used to arrive at a preferred phylogenic
   reconstruction. Island ages of the hot spot archipelagoes involved are
   well known. The phylogeny was then compared with the palaeogeology.
   Information on evolution of running water habitats as islands age was
   incorporated into the biogeography.
   Results Cladistic analysis of forty of the forty-eight known Inseliellum
   species with Simulium (Nevermannia) neornatipes Dumbleton from New
   Caledonia and S. (Hebridosimulium) laciniatum Edwards from Fuji as
   outgroups, shows basal species and clades to be on widely separated
   older islands. In the Society Islands basal species are widely spread.
   Derived species, with morphological adaptations to deal with specialized
   habitats, are on younger islands (e.g. Tahiti), where a major species
   radiation has taken place. The reconstructed phylogeny indicates
   dispersal back to older islands, with minor subsequent species
   radiation.
   Main conclusions Palaeogeological evidence provides a basis for
   postulating that Inseliellum entered the western Pacific area some 20
   Ma, with the possibility that it rafted eastwards on proto-Tonga Islands
   to the edge of southern-central Pacific. Older Cook Islands were present
   at that time. Movement into the Marquesas Islands was not earlier than 6
   Ma and into the Society Islands perhaps 8-10 Ma. Basal species with
   generalized habitat requirements would have found suitable habitats
   (inferred from hydrological postulates) on leaves in the original, small
   shaded streams. With erosion and valley development, in particular on
   Tahiti, species radiated into specialized habitats such as cascades.
   Rich seston and high velocity probably drove reduction of filtering fans
   in some clades. With collapse of the caldera and formation of large
   rivers at c. 0.9 Ma, S. exasperans Craig and S. tahitiense Edwards
   adapted to deep, swiftly flowing water, all indicative that specialized
   habitat availability drove species radiation in Inseliellum. In the
   Society Islands, dispersal of derived species back to the oldest western
   islands was not possible because erosion has removed suitable habitats.

   then turns to more contemporary trends, namely the influence of 30 years
   of neoliberal ideology. It argues that the belief that Haiti can best
   achieve food security through the pursuit of comparative advantage, a
   notion advanced and supported by powerful international and domestic
   actors, has served to reinforce harmful historic trends. We support this
   argument with recent fieldwork findings that highlight how the
   construction of a new export processing zone (EPZ), following the 2010
   earthquake, has generated troubling environmental and food security
   concerns.

AB Terrestrial and freshwater molluscs are amongst the most threatened of
   all taxa, yet data exist on the distribution and status of only a small
   proportion of the species. Here we present the results of the first
   systematic survey of a terrestrial mollusc on the island of Principe in
   the Gulf of Guinea Archachatina bicarinata has never been previously
   surveyed, despite being categorized as Vulnerable on the IUCN Red List
   and suffering from unregulated harvesting for food. We found that A
   bicarinata is restricted to primary rainforest and its abundance and
   probability of occurrence increased as surveyed sites became less
   accessible. Additional anecdotal evidence from the observations of
   previous scientific expeditions, local guides and snail harvesters
   suggested that the species has suffered a dramatic decline in population
   size and distribution in recent years We therefore recommend that
   immediate action be taken to prevent its imminent extinction on Principe
   The collection of A bicarinata from protected areas should be banned, as
   should commercial harvesting and sales. Subsistence collecting should be
   limited to larger individuals Our data have been used to inform the
   management plans for the protected areas on Principe and Sao Tome, and
   this should help to ensure the future of A bicarinata on both islands.

AB In the highlands of New Guinea, the development of agriculture as an
   indigenous innovation during the Early Holocene is considered to have
   resulted in rapid loss of forest cover, a decrease in forest
   biodiversity and increased land degradation over thousands of years. But
   how important is human activity in shaping the diversity of vegetation
   communities over millennial time-scales? An evaluation of the change in
   biodiversity of forest habitats through the Late Glacial transition to
   the present in five palaeoecological sites from highland valleys, where
   intensive agriculture is practised today, is presented. A detailed
   analysis of the longest and most continuous record from Papua New Guinea
   is also presented using available biodiversity indices ( palynological
   richness and biodiversity indicator taxa) as a means of identifying
   changes in diversity. The analysis shows that the collapse of key forest
   habitats in the highland valleys is evident during the Mid - Late
   Holocene. These changes are best explained by the adoption of new land
   management practices and altered disturbance regimes associated with
   agricultural activity, though climate change may also play a role. The
   implications of these findings for ecosystem conservation and
   sustainability of agriculture in New Guinea are discussed.

AB When predators differentiate among prey species, they commonly select
   the most abundant species. Surprisingly, on coral reefs in Australia and
   the Bahamas, we found evidence to the contrary: using null models, we
   observed that generalist predators had a greater impact on less-abundant
   species, thereby reducing local species richness. Disproportionate
   effects on these rare species were evident during a narrow window of
   time between settlement and 1-2 days later, highlighting how
   interactions during or immediately following settlement may influence
   subsequent community structure. Differences in species richness between
   treatments that were established during this narrow window of time
   eventually disappeared from reefs in Australia but persisted on reefs in
   the Bahamas. Our results highlight an unexpected and largely unexplored
   ecological interaction whereby predators reduce prey diversity.

AB The discharge variability of the main rivers that drain the Guyana
   Shield is analysed over the last 50 years using cross-wavelet, coherence
   and composite analysis involving oceanic and atmospheric variables. We
   highlight the overall hydro-climatological homogeneity of this region
   that allowed us to focus on the longest discharge time series available.
   Therefore, a wavelet cross-analysis was carried out between monthly and
   seasonal Maroni River discharge at the Langa Tabiki station and selected
   climate indices. This confirms a strong relationship between the
   hydrology of the Guyana Shield and the Pacific sea-surface temperature
   (SST) fluctuations. There is evidence of intermittent influence, of
   between inter-annual and near decadal scales, of the Atlantic SST
   fluctuations, in particular around 1970 and 1990. Finally, we show that
   the links between oceanic regions and high discharge in the rivers of
   Guyana are realized through the reinforcement of the Walker and Hadley
   cells between the Amazon and the adjacent oceans and through decreased
   trade winds and monsoon flux that favour the persistence of humidity
   over the Guyana Shield.

AB Benthic-pelagic coupling and the role of bottom-up versus top-down
   processes are recognized as having a major impact on the structure of
   marine communities. While the roles of bottom-up processes are better
   appreciated they are still viewed as principally affecting the outcome
   of top-down processes. Sponges on coral reefs are important members of
   the benthic community and provide a critically important functional
   linkage between water-column productivity and the benthos. As active
   suspension feeders sponges utilize the abundant autotrophic and
   heterotrophic picoplankton in the water column. As a result sponges
   across the Caribbean basin exhibit a consistent and significant pattern
   of greater biomass, tube extension rate, and species numbers with
   increasing depth. Likewise, the abundance of their food supply also
   increases along a depth gradient. Using experimental manipulations it
   has recently been reported that predation is the primary determinant of
   sponge community structure. Here we provide data showing that the size
   and growth of the sponge Callyspongia vaginalis are significantly
   affected by food availability. Sponges increased in size and tube
   extension rate with increasing depth down to 46 m, while simultaneously
   exposed to the full range of potential spongivores at all depths.
   Additionally, we point out important flaws in the experimental design
   used to demonstrate the role of predation and suggest that a resolution
   of this important question will require well-controlled, multi-factorial
   experiments to examine the independent and interactive effects of
   predation and food abundance on the ecology of sponges.

AB Renewable energy (RE) is noted for its socio-economic benefits as a
   sustainable source of energy particularly for small island developing
   states. However, for a country such as Trinidad and Tobago which is
   relatively rich in fossil fuels, this truism is severely tested. At
   current costs, RE technologies cannot compete with natural gas for power
   generation, especially when the latter is relatively cheap and easily
   available. However, this paper uses a widened economic envelope for
   assessment of RE, that takes into account the cost of natural gas and
   the potential benefits of participation in the carbon business. Lost
   government revenues from incremental gas export plus carbon credits from
   RE projects that are structured as clean development mechanisms are
   enough to offset the higher cost of RE. This has implications for the
   country's energy policy direction in terms of diversifying and
   sustaining the country's energy sector. We explore the economic,
   technological and market conditions which are necessary to support RE's
   penetration into the future energy matrix of the country.

AB Many believe that the Central American Seaway closed near 4 Ma and that
   that closure led to increased salinity in the Caribbean Sea and stronger
   Meridional Overturning Circulation in the Atlantic, which facilitated
   the waxing and waning of ice sheets in the Northern Hemisphere. We offer
   an alternative explanation for Caribbean salinification. The atmosphere
   transports approximately 0.23 Sv (1 Sv = 10(6) m(3)s(-1)) of fresh water
   (moisture) from the Caribbean to the Pacific today, but that amount
   varies by >20% during El Nino-Southern Oscillation events. Regressions
   of moisture transport against the Nino-3 index, a measure of the sea
   surface temperature in the eastern tropical Pacific, show less moisture
   transport from the Caribbean during El Nino events than average.
   Abundant evidence indicates that at 3-4 Ma the eastern tropical Pacific
   was 3.5-4 degrees C warmer than today, and if so, an extrapolation of
   such regressions suggests that smaller moisture transport across Central
   America might account for paleoceanographic inferences of a smaller
   salinity difference between the Caribbean and Pacific at that time.
   Accordingly, that decreased salinity difference at similar to 3-4 Ma
   would not require blockage of relatively fresh Pacific water at similar
   to 2-4 Ma by the closure of the Central American Seaway, but rather
   would be consistent with a transition from El Nino to La Nina-like
   conditions in the eastern tropical Pacific around that time.

AB Gekkotaenia novaeguineaensis n. gen., n. sp. (Cestoda: Anoplocephalidae)
   from the small intestine and Cosmocerca zugi n. sp. (Nematoda:
   Cosmocercidae) from the large intestine of the ring-tailed gecko,
   Cyrtodactylus louisiadensis (Sauria: Gekkonidae) are described and
   illustrated. Gekkotaenia novaeguineaensis n. gen., n. sp. is unique
   among the acraspedote Linstowiinae in possessing a poral female
   reproductory system. Cosmocerca zugi n. sp. is the 22nd species to be
   assigned to the genus and differs from other species in the genus by
   possessing 4 pairs of rosette papillae on plectanes and having a
   gubernaculum longer than the spicules. It is the fifth species to be
   described from the Australian biogeographical region. Eight additional
   helminth species were found: the digenean, Allopharynx macallisteri; 2
   cestodes, cysticercoids of Cyclophyllidea gen. sp. and tetrathyridia of
   Mesocestoides sp.; 5 nematodes, larvae in cysts of Abbreviata sp.,
   Aplectana macintoshii, Oswaldocruzia bakeri, Parapharyngodon
   maplestonei, and an undescribed species of Physalopteroides.
   Cyrtodactylus louisiadensis represents a new host record for each of
   these helminths.

AB Solar home systems (SHS) can provide energy services to rural households
   more cost effectively than extending national grids, and without relying
   on polluting fuels such as kerosene, diesel and coal. This study
   explores four recent SHS programmes supported by the World Bank's Asia
   Sustainable and Alternative Energy Program in China, Laos, Mongolia and
   Papua New Guinea that budgeted $328.2 million to distribute a targeted
   401,500 such systems to nomadic herders, fishers and teachers. It
   documents three approaches to promote such systems: a technology
   improvement and market development model, a cross-subsidization and
   energy service company model, and an end-user direct lending model.
   After explaining its primary methods of data collection - research
   interviews and in-country site visits - the study summarizes each
   programme before focusing on their benefits and implementation
   challenges. It then connects the successes and failures of these
   programs to broader lessons about energy development in general. The
   study finds that programmes dedicated to technology improvement, market
   development, cross-subsidization, and energy service companies met their
   targets, whereas the one programme based on end-user finance in Papua
   New Guinea performed poorly.

TI Causes of endemic radiation in the Caribbean: evidence from the

   Calisto (Nymphalidae: Satyrinae: Satyrini)

AB Background: Calisto is the largest butterfly genus in the West Indies
   but its systematics, historical biogeography and the causes of its
   diversification have not been previously rigorously evaluated. Several
   studies attempting to explain the wide-ranging diversity of Calisto gave
   different weights to vicariance, dispersal and adaptive radiation. We
   utilized molecular phylogenetic approaches and secondary calibrations
   points to estimate lineage ages. In addition, we used the
   dispersal-extinction-cladogenesis model and Caribbean paleogeographical
   information to reconstruct ancestral geographical distributions. We also
   evaluated different models of diversification to estimate the dynamics
   of lineage radiation within Calisto. By understanding the evolution of
   Calisto butterflies, we attempt to identify the main processes acting on
   insular insect diversity and the causes of its origin and its
   maintenance.
   Results: The crown age of Calisto was estimated to the early Oligocene
   (31 +/- 5 Ma), and a single shift in diversification rate following a
   diversity-dependent speciation process was the best explanation for the
   present-day diversity found within the genus. A major increase in
   diversification rate was recovered at 14 Ma, following geological
   arrangements that favoured the availability of empty niches. Inferred
   ancestral distributional ranges suggested that the origin of extant
   Calisto is in agreement with a vicariant model and the origin of the
   Cuban lineage was likely the result of vicariance caused by the
   Cuba-Hispaniola split. A long-distance dispersal was the best
   explanation for the colonization of Jamaica and the Bahamas.
   Conclusions: The ancestral geographical distribution of Calisto is in
   line with the paleogeographical model of Caribbean colonization, which
   favours island-to-island vicariance. Because the sister lineage of
   Calisto remains ambiguous, its arrival to the West Indies remains to be
   explained, although, given its age and historical biogeography, the
   hypothesized GAARlandia land bridge might have been a plausible
   introduction route from continental America. Intra-island radiation
   caused by ecological innovation and the abiotic creation of niche spaces
   was found to be the main force shaping Calisto diversity and island
   endemism in Hispaniola and Cuba.
