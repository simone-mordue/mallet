AB Peasant farmers in northern Haiti have lost more than access to state
   land in a recent public-private partnership between the agro-export
   corporation Agritrans and the Government of Haiti. Using the Haitian
   concept of poto mitan, characterised by locally defined attributes of
   the moral economy of community care, identity and autonomy, this
   research establishes how peasants lose the ability to make critical and
   strategic contributions to food security and social stability. This
   suggests that large-scale agro-export development trades peasants'
   welfare for shareholders' and for GDP growth and does not truly create a
   net benefit for Haiti.

AB This study tests the hypothesis that the late Miocene to early Pliocene
   constriction and closure of the Central American Seaway (CAS),
   connecting the tropical Atlantic and East quatorial Pacific (EEP),
   caused a decrease in productivity in the Caribbean, due to decreased
   coastal upwelling and an end to the connection with high-productivity
   tropical Pacific waters. The present study compared paleoceanographic
   proxies for the interval between 8.3 and 2.5 Ma in 47 samples from south
   Caribbean ODP Site 999 with published data on EEP DSDP Site 503. Proxies
   for Site 999 include the relative abundance of benthic foraminiferal
   species representing bottom current velocity and the flux of organic
   matter to the sea floor, the ratio of infaunaUepifaunal benthic
   foraminiferal species and benthic foraminifer accumulation rates
   (BFARs). In addition, we calculated % resistant planktic foraminifers
   species and used the previously published % sand fraction and benthic
   carbon isotope values from Site 999.
   During early shoaling of the Isthmus (8.3-7.9 Ma) the Caribbean was
   tinder niesotrophic conditions, with little ventilation of bottom waters
   and low current velocity. The pre-closure interval (7.6-4.2 Ma) saw
   enhanced seasonal input of phytodetritus with even more reduced
   ventilation, and enhanced dissolution between 6.8 and 4.8 Ma. During the
   post-closure interval (4.2-2.5 Ma) in the Caribbean, paleoproductivity
   decreased, current velocity was reduced, and ventilation improved, while
   the seasonality of phytodetrital input was reduced dramatically,
   coinciding with the establishment of the Atlantic-Pacific salinity
   contrast at 4.2 Ma. Our data support the hypothesis that late Miocene
   constriction of the CAS at 7.9 Ma and its closure at 4.2 Ma caused a
   gradual decrease in paleoproductivity in the Caribbean, consistent with
   decreased current velocity and seasonality of the phytodetrital input.

AB This paper is organised around the analysis of an 'event'; a truck trip
   from Kwima, a Maring speaking settlement in the Western Highlands of
   Papua New Guinea, to Banz in the Wahgi Valley and an evening spent on
   the road. The event forms a standpoint from which to assess the impact
   of the decline of civic space, and faltering legacy of colonial
   governmentality, in the Jimi since 1980. I describe the emergence of new
   forms of mobility based around the nexus between local forms of business
   and trucks. In particular I focus on new and anxious forms of masculine
   inside relationships, understood as a transformation of a habitus of
   intimacy, round which such mobility is built. I argue that this
   transformation should be understood in terms of the dialectical
   relationship between business as an expansive profit oriented project on
   the one hand, and its anchoring in clan defined space on the other. At
   the same time the event provides a vantage point to reflect on the
   nature of long-term fieldwork, the methodological significance of the
   subjectivity of the ethnographer, and the nature of ethnographic error.

AB The radiative and microphysical characteristics of 17 precipitating
   systems observed by the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM)
   satellite over Manus, Papua New Guinea, and Nauru Island are modeled.
   These cases represent both deep and midlevel convection. Reflectivity
   data from the TRMM precipitation radar and Geostationary Meteorological
   Satellite infrared radiometer measurements are used to parameterize the
   three-dimensional cloud microphysics of each precipitating cloud system.
   These parameterized cloud properties are used as input for a two-stream
   radiative transfer model. Comparisons with measurements of broadband
   radiative fluxes at the top of atmosphere and the surface show agreement
   to within 20%. In cases in which the convective available potential
   energy (CAPE) is large, deep convective clouds with extended anvil decks
   form, containing layers of ice crystals that are too small to be
   detected by the TRMM radar but have a large optical thickness. This
   results in maximum shortwave heating and longwave cooling near cloud top
   at heights of 12-14 km. When CAPE is small, convective clouds extend
   only to midlevels (4-7 km), and there are no cloud layers below the
   detectability limit of the TRMM radar. Radiative heating and cooling in
   these cases are maximum near the freezing level. A sensitivity analysis
   suggests that the small ice crystals near the cloud top and larger
   precipitation-sized particles play equally significant roles in
   producing the high albedos of tropical anvil clouds. A comparison of the
   radiative heating profiles calculated in this study with latent heating
   profiles from previous studies shows that for cases of mature deep
   convection near local solar noon, the maximum radiative heating is
   10%-30% of the magnitude of the maximum latent heating.

AB In tropical waters reefs provide local populations with food as well as
   with a source of income. Various types of regulatory measures have been
   adopted worldwide for the sustainable use of these resources. The cases
   of Papua New Guinea and Indonesia are examined to evaluate the roles of
   customary practices under rapidly changing socio-economic conditions. In
   Maluku, eastern Indonesia, harvesting of coconut, sage, trepang,
   trochus, and reef fish is controlled by sasi, community-based resource
   management practices, under prior authorization by the head of local
   government. In Manus, Papua New Guinea, reefs are exclusively claimed
   and used by certain clan members. Disputes over reef ownership are
   resolved through either informal compromise between local groups or
   judgment in the local court, which gives customary practices top
   priority. These cases illustrate the significant role of local
   government as an important agency for resource management as well as
   social integration.

AB Based on literature records and the results of an extensive trapping

   records, over 500 are new. Based on species accumulation curves,
   Central, Morobe, Madang, Eastern Highlands, Western Highlands, New
   Ireland and Bougainville provinces, plus the province pairs of East and
   West Sepik, East and West New Britain, and Southern Highlands and Enga,
   can be regarded as having been adequately sampled. The remaining
   provinces should still be regarded as being under-collected. On mainland
   PNG, Morobe and Central provinces have the richest faunas and highest
   levels of endemism, approximately 15% each. All other mainland provinces
   have very low levels of endemism and are essentially subsets of the
   faunas of Morobe and Central Province. Although also with very low
   levels of endemism, the Highlands provinces have a statistically
   distinct fauna, suggesting that a pool of the PNG species are able to
   utilise both lowland and highland habitats. The fruit fly fauna of the
   island provinces is distinct from the mainland fauna, with further
   separation between the islands of the Bismark Archipelago (New Britain
   and New Ireland) and Bougainville. The greatest diversity of flies in
   PNG are associated with major northern geological elements, i.e., the
   New Guinea orogen, New Guinea accreted terranes and the off-shore
   islands, rather than the primary southern geological element, the
   Australian creton.

AB Mineralogical, petrological and geochemical analyses of corals and
   associated skeletal limestones taken from three transects across the
   Late Quaternary raised coral reefs of the Huon Peninsula, Papua New
   Guinea, show that tectonic uplift can be related to the degree of
   subaerial diagenesis of the reefs.  Where the uplift rate is high,
   Pleistocene corals frequently retain their aragonite mineralogy, even
   though the annual rainfall is relatively high.  In contrast, similar age
   corals from low-uplift areas are consistently altered neomorphically to
   calcite.  The transformation of reef skeletal limestones shows a
   similar, but less pronounced, trend to the corals.  Chemical analysis
   shows that the neomorphic calcite crystals of coral skeletons from the
   low-uplift areas have relatively higher Sr and Mg concentrations,
   compared with those in high-uplift areas.  This may indicate that
   neomorphism of corals in the low-uplift terraces takes place at a
   relatively higher rate and an earlier stage than that in the high-uplift
   areas.  The pattern of diagenesis of the Huon reefs can be explained by
   the effects of tectonic uplift on the regional hydrological regime. 
   First, lower uplift rates allow a raised reef or any part of it to
   remain in the meteoric phreatic zone for a relatively long time. 
   Second, river gorge slopes from low-uplift regions have lower gradients
   and reef terraces in these areas have more extensive raised lagoon
   depressions than in high-uplift areas.  Thus, there is less runoff and
   consequently more extensive vadose percolation in the former areas. 
   Third, the resulting low-relief topography in low-uplift areas prompts
   formation of soils on the terraces, and further increases the ability of
   interaction between coral reefs and formation water.

AB There are about 2500 genera of seed plants in the Caribbean. These
   include 204 endemic flowering plants and one endemic gymnosperm
   (Microcycas). All the endemic genera are confined to the Greater
   Antilles. Of these, 118 are restricted to individual islands. Naturally
   occurring food plants are extremely few. Many of these possess a fleshy
   pericarp, while only a few of these species of trees and shrubs are used
   to any extent by people. Medicinal plants in current use are widely
   dispersed in Jamaica and the Caribbean; however, the notion is often
   voiced that native Caribbean flora might yield new medicinal plants and
   that forests should be conserved pending searches for them. A number of
   potential ornamental species includes shrubs (e. g. Gesneria spp.,
   Lisianthius spp., and Portlandia spp.), trees (e. g. Charianthus
   fadyenii, Thespesia grandiflora), cacti (e. g. Rhodocactus cubensis),
   epiphytes (e. g. many bromeliads and orchids), climbers (e. g.
   Passiflora spp., Solandra spp.) and ferns. Moreover, many craft
   materials are obtained from common and readily available crops, such as
   coconut or maize, or from widespread introduced ornamentals or shade
   trees, such as flamboyant (Delonix regia) or red bead tree (Adenanthera
   pavonina).

AB Palau is world famous for its relatively pristine and highly diverse

   Zoantharia, an order of benthic cnidarians within the Class Anthozoa
   (Subclass Hexacorallia) that are commonly found in shallow subtropical
   and tropical waters. Here, we examine the species diversity of zoanthids
   in Palau for the first time, based on shallow-water (< 35 m) scuba
   surveys and morphological identification to create a preliminary
   zoanthid species list for Palau. Our results indicated the presence of
   nine zoanthid species in Palau (Zoanthus sansibaricus, Z. gigantus,
   Palythoa tuberculosa, P. mutuki, P. heliodiscus, Palythoa cf. toxica,
   Epizoanthus illoricatus, Parazoanthus sp., Microzoanthus kagerou),
   apparently slightly more than have been recently observed in nearby
   Guam, Saipan, and the Ogasawara Islands. Additionally, it appears that
   some zoanthid species that have been observed to be co-occurring in the
   fringing reefs of Okinawa may inhabit different locations in the better
   developed reefs of Palau.

   documented. A hazard analysis of traditional sago starch production and
   consumption was conducted, based on observations of the preparation
   process, and findings from sociological and microbiological studies.
   Hazards identified included common pathogenic bacteria and toxigenic
   fungi. Critical control points (CPP) were identified at various stages
   of the production process, including tree selection, starch extraction,
   sago storage and cooking. Storage methods that promoted spontaneous
   fermentation were deemed the most important risk reduction process in
   the production of safe sago starch. The CCPs formed the basis of an
   education campaign that was developed to provide guidance on how to
   maximise the safety of sago starch within the Cultural and
   socio-economic context of rural PNG. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

AB Caribbean reefs have experienced unprecedented changes in the past 40
   years. A major hypothesis to explain shifts in reef community
   composition relates to declining herbivory. This hypothesis was
   developed largely based on observations of Jamaican reefs from the 1980s
   onward, but it is widely held to be relevant regionally. We use a
   region-wide dataset on benthic composition to examine how well the
   pattern of ecological change on Jamaican reefs is mirrored by other
   Caribbean reefs. The extent to which macroalgal cover exceeds coral
   cover on Jamaican reefs is an order of magnitude more extreme than seen
   elsewhere. We suggest that Jamaican reefs are not representative of the
   degradation trajectory of Caribbean reefs and management based on the
   Jamaican experience may not be relevant elsewhere. However, the recovery
   of Jamaican reefs following the return of urchins gives us hope that
   Caribbean reefs are more resilient to catastrophic disturbances than
   previously thought. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The Pacific-Asia Biodiversity Transect (PABITRA) studies are based on a
   network of high-island biodiversity sites. These sites are structurally
   and historically complex. The majority of Pacific islands, in contrast,
   are low atolls with a common and simple flora and structure. As a
   result, atolls may serve as "controls" that may provide a way to assess
   impact of the upland high-island ecosystems on coastal regions of
   Pacific islands. Atoll studies can complement the PABITRA network
   because the gateway sites are near each other or separated from one
   another by one or more atolls. Such an addition will enhance
   interpretation of high-island ecosystems and their coastal zones because
   ecosystem surveys can be conducted quickly and accurately in atoll
   environments. We present results from quantitative studies of plant
   diversity from seven islets at Ailinginae Atoll in the northern Marshall
   Islands and discuss the value of this methodology as a way to enhance
   interpretation of the PABITRA data.

AB The Cobra-Preta (black snake in Portuguese) of Sao Tome Island in the
   Gulf of Guinea has historically been referred to as Naja (Boulengerina)
   melanoleuca (Squamata: Elapidae). Its presence on the island has been
   traditionally explained as an introduction from the mainland by
   Portuguese settlers, supposedly to control the rat population. This
   explanation has been widely accepted by local authorities and even
   international conservation agencies. The taxonomic identity of this
   snake has remained undisputed by all taxonomists who have published
   about it, with the exception of L. Capocaccia in 1961. Arguments
   supporting the human introduction hypothesis are weak and are
   contradicted by historical, morphological and molecular data. Further,
   the biogeographic history of the Gulf of Guinea oceanic islands and
   recent insights on the taxonomic identity and evolutionary history of
   other taxonomic groups occurring there suggest that the Cobra-Preta, in
   fact, represents a distinct lineage of the melanoleuca group, endemic to
   Sao Tome. We here describe the Cobra Preta as a new species. The new
   species differs from N. (B.) melanoleuca, its sister species, by a
   distinct coloration ventral pattern and the type of contact of the
   sublingual scales. Data on the toxicology, distribution, ecology,
   folklore and conservation status of the new species are presented.

AB Infaunal macroinvertebrates were characterized along an environmental

   located at 7.5, 60, and 150 m from the vent and from a nonhydrothermal
   reference site located to the north. Temperature and arsenic
   concentration were found to decrease and pH increased with distance away
   from the vent. At each site, five replicate core samples were taken
   randomly from a 1 m(2) sampling grid. All infaunal invertebrates >500 mu
   m were sorted, identified to the lowest practical taxonomic level and
   counted Results from the macrofauna data show a strong trend of
   increasing abundance, species richness and diversity relative to
   distance away from the vent, but even at 150 in the benthic macrofauna
   appeared to be depressed relative to the reference site. Mollusks were
   completely absent 75 m from the vent, rare at 60 in, and abundant at 150
   in, suggesting that the low pH values associated with the hydrothermal
   activity play an important role in the benthic community structure.

PY 2013
AB The order Amphipoda is one of the most diverse within Peracarids, and
   comprises 6 950 described marine species. Amphipod research in the
   Caribbean Sea began in the late 1 800s, but has increased significantly
   since 1 980. In this study, we analized the amphipod biodiversity
   (Caprellidea, Gammaridea, Hyperiidea, and Ingolfiellidea) of the
   Caribbean Sea. For this, we compiled available data on species diversity
   of marine amphipods (data bases: WoRMS and OBIS and published species
   lists) into a comprehensive taxonomic list by country for the ecoregions
   of the Caribbean. Additionally, we analized the relative contribution of
   each country to regional diversity and the rate of discovery of new
   species. The Caribbean amphipod fauna is composed of 535 species within
   236 genera and 73 families for the higher taxon. The Western Caribbean
   ecoregion holds the largest diversity (282 species), while the Eastern
   Caribbean recorded the lowest one (73). Mexico and Venezuela recorded
   the largest number of species with 266 and 206, respectively. Twelve
   countries had less than 50 species. The richest suborder is the
   Gammaridea with 381 species followed by the suborder Hyperiidea with
   116. From the total of 535 amphipod species reported for the Caribbean
   region, 218 have the Caribbean as the holotype locality, and 132 are
   endemic (about 25% of the total). Areas of higher diversity seem to be
   concentrated along the Mexican Caribbean, Cuba and the Northern coast of
   South America (Venezuela-Colombia); however, such pattern is most likely
   reflecting local collection efforts and taxonomic expertise rather than
   actual distribution. Knowledge of amphipod species is mostly limited to
   shallow, near-shore waters, with little information available on the
   deep sea fauna. Regional research priorities for this group should be
   focused on completing shallow water coastal inventories of species in
   Central America and the Greater and Lesser Antilles. In addition,
   sampling the deep sea ecosystems should follow along with other
   particular habitats such as anchialine cave systems. It is also
   neccessary to increase ecological research efforts, mainly in some
   speciose suborders, including the Caprellidea and Hyperiidea, known to
   exhibit high diversity in other tropical localities.

AB Consideration of the spatial dimension in the provision of ecosystem
   services is fundamental for the calculation of the economic value of
   ecosystem services and the distribution across beneficiaries and
   ecosystems. In the context of Small Island Developing States, the
   islands of Trinidad and Tobago are characterized by a rich natural
   capital, which lies at the source of the provision of all ecosystem
   services. Such natural capital, however, is threatened by a range of
   anthropogenic pressures. This paper builds upon state-of-the-art benefit
   transfer techniques and Geographic Information Systems to provide the
   first maps of the value of three key ecosystem services in Trinidad and
   Tobago. Result estimates indicate that the mean value of carbon
   sequestration by terrestrial and coastal ecosystems amounts to 65
   US$/ha/year. Mean values for coastal recreation and shoreline coastal
   protection are estimated in 6468 and 924 US$/ha/year, respectively. We
   discuss how this spatially explicit valuation exercise may feed into
   Trinidad and Tobago's National Spatial Development Plan, thus
   contributing toward a more sustainable use of the country's natural
   capital.

AB Culling can be an effective management tool for reducing populations of
   invasive species to levels that minimize ecological effects. However,
   culling is labour-intensive, costly, and may have unintended ecological
   consequences. In the Caribbean, culling is widely used to control
   invasive Indo-Pacific lionfish, Pterois volitans and P. miles, but the
   effectiveness of infrequent culling in terms of reducing lionfish
   abundance and halting native prey decline is unclear. In a 21-month-long
   field experiment on natural reefs, we found that culling effectiveness
   changed after the passage of a hurricane part-way through the
   experiment. Before the hurricane, infrequent culling resulted in
   substantial reductions in lionfish density (60-79%, on average, albeit
   with large uncertainty) and slight increases in native prey species
   richness, but was insufficient to stem the decline in native prey
   biomass. Culling every 3 months (i.e., quarterly) and every 6 months
   (i.e., biannually) had similar effects on lionfish density and native
   prey fishes because of high rates of lionfish colonization among reefs.
   After the hurricane, lionfish densities were greater on all culled reefs
   compared to non-culled reefs, and prey biomass declined by 92%, and
   species richness by 71%, on biannually culled reefs. The two culling
   frequencies we examined therefore seem to offer a poor trade-off between
   the demonstrated conservation gains that can be achieved with frequent
   culling and the economy of time and money realized by infrequent
   culling. Moreover, stochastic events such as hurricanes can drastically
   limit the effectiveness of culling efforts.

   ciprofloxacin, enrofloxacin, gentamicin, nalidixic acid, imipenem and
   trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. One isolate (S. Montevideo) showed

AB Traps baited with plant remains, either Thalassia or Sargassum, were
   deployed for 30 h on the seabed at depths of 500 and 10 m in the
   Bahamas. On retrieval, the deep traps had been colonised by three
   species of amphipod whilst inert controls (traps containing black
   plastic bags) had attracted only a single specimen of a fourth species.
   These data suggest the amphipods are attracted to plant debris as food
   rather than as shelter. Significantly more amphipods were attracted at
   the deepwater site than at the shallow site. We suggest that
   algal/seagrass foodfalls are a significant pathway by which energy
   enters the deep-sea and will be colonised rapidly by deepwater
   invertebrates.

   pyrethroids permethrin, cypermethrin and deltamethrin, and these
   synthetic pyrethroids in white spirit. The depth of colonisation by soft
   rot fungi and tunnelling bacteria was measured. Numbers of the barnacle
   Balanus amphitrite and an unidentified serpulid worm on the treated
   blocks were counted after different exposure periods at four tropical
   sites in Australia, Papua New Guinea and Singapore. Soft rot was
   controlled at three sites by any treatment containing creosote, but some
   soft rot was detected in most treatments at Singapore. Attack of samples
   by tunnelling bacteria was less rapid, though most treatments were
   subject to some wood cell wall deterioration. Treatments with high
   loadings of creosote combined with CCA had lower numbers of barnacles
   than other treatments at two sites, but at Singapore, treatments of CCA
   combined with lower amounts of creosote showed no such effect. The
   presence of creosote in a treatment appeared to promote barnacle
   settlement at Singapore from the outset and this effect was also noted
   after exposure for more than two years at other sites that had samples
   treated with higher creosote loadings. Components of creosote may mimic
   the effect of chemicals known to be implicated in barnacle settlement
   behaviour. Initially, the presence of creosote discouraged serpulid
   settlement, but after more than two years in the sea, no difference was
   detectable between different treatments.

   spp. occur worldwide in warm shallow-water environments, but not all

   are subtle but, based on phylogenetic analysis of mitochondrial markers,
   two species groups can be distinguished, each containing numerous
   subclades. The objectives of this study were to determine the position
   of in the phylogeny of the genus, to assess the species' genetic
   distinctness and to describe epitokes morphologically. We sequenced
   epitokes from Samoa (locally known as ) and Vanuatu () for two
   mitochondrial markers and performed phylogenetic analyses in combination
   with previously published sequences. The samples from Samoa and Vanuatu
   formed a common clade in species group B. We suggest that swarming is

   Sea Drilling Project (DSDP) Sites 536 and 540, which were previously
   interpreted as impact-generated megawave deposits of K-T boundary age,
   are biostratigraphically of pre-K-T boundary age and probably represent
   turbidite or gravity-flow deposits. The top 10 to 20 cm of this deposit
   at Site 536 contains very rare Micula prinsii, the uppermost
   Maastrichtian index taxon, as well as low values of Ir (0.6 pbb) and

   accumulation across the K-T boundary in the 16 Gulf of Mexico and

   impact-generated megawave deposits in this region. Our study indicates
   that the most complete trans-K-T stratigraphic records may be found in

   71% (reptiles).  On a global scale, for their size both Principe and Sao
   Tome support unusually high numbers of single-island endemic species of
   birds, reptiles and amphibia.  For its tiny size, Annobon is also
   notable for its endemic birds and reptiles.  Among terrestrial molluscs
   the rates of endemism are in general higher than for plants and
   vertebrates, from ca 50% on Bioko to ca 80% on the oceanic islands.  In
   contrast and as might be expected, only Bioko supports a rich freshwater
   fish fauna and it contains many endemic taxa, whereas the oceanic
   islands support only a few salt-tolerant species.  The Gulf of Guinea
   islands are also important for their marine organisms, amongst which
   coral reef fish and marginellid molluscs show high levels of endemism,
   though they are not especially species-rich.  The Gulf of Guinea islands
   are of great interest to conservationists and evolutionary biologists. 
   Each island, of greatly differing size and degree of isolation, has
   acquired its unique sub-set of plants and animals separately from the
   neighbouring mainland, followed by adaptive radiations in situ.  For
   this reason the conservation value of the archipelago as a whole is
   greater than the sum of the biodiversity contained in its individual
   islands.  Conservation initiatives in the Gulf of Guinea should
   therefore ensure that representative terrestrial, freshwater and marine
   habitats and groups of organisms are targeted in a co-ordinated manner
   among the islands.

AB We constructed stable isotope profiles for 16 Recent venerid bivalve
   shells from four environmental regions in the eastern tropical Pacific
   and the southwestern Caribbean. The environments sampled were: 1) the
   Gulf of Chiriqui, a non-upwelling region in the eastern Pacific; 2)
   Panama Bay, an upwelling region in the eastern. Pacific; 3) the
   Caribbean non-upwelling region, of northern Panama and northwestern
   Colombia west of Cartegena; and 4) the Caribbean upwelling region of
   northern Colombia east of Cartagena and the northern Gulf of Venezuela.
   The four environments are generally well-characterized by the shell
   profiles. In particular, the delta(18)O range is greatest in upwelling
   environments, and, to a lesser extent, is greater in the eastern Pacific
   than in the Caribbean.
   The delta(13)C record by itself is much less useful than the delta(18)O
   record, but examining delta(18)O and delta(13)C in combination adds
   important discriminatory information to environmental comparisons. A
   significant positive correlation between delta(18)O and delta(13)C is
   present in most Caribbean shells and in the single Pacific non-upwelling
   shell. All shells from the Pacific upwelling region of Panama Bay
   exhibit relatively flat delta(13)C profiles and lack significant
   correlations between delta(18)O and delta(13)C.
   We compared observed values of delta(18)O with ''predicted'' values
   calculated from temperature and salinity data from each environment.
   Observed patterns of delta(18)O minima and maxima along bathymetric
   gradients generally parallel those predicted for these shells, but
   absolute values of observed delta(18)O are lower than predicted values.
   Maximum and minimum values of delta(18)O generally increase with
   increasing depth, except in the non-upwelling region of northern Panama.

AB The variation in windward and leeward marine environments has been
   linked to distinctions in marine subsistence on large, high volcanic
   Pacific Islands, but these patterns have not been explored on low coral
   atolls. We document windward vs. leeward islet site variation in the
   taxonomic composition of fish bone and mollusc shell assemblages from
   three archaeological sites at Ebon Atoll, Republic of the Marshall
   Islands, to elucidate the relationship between local environment,
   archaeological site type and the taxonomic composition of marine
   archaeofaunal assemblages. While the representation of taxa at each site
   was broadly similar in terms of measures of taxonomic heterogeneity
   (richness, evenness and dominance), chord distance and correspondence
   analysis reported variation in taxonomic composition at each site. For
   mollusc shell assemblages, variation in taxonomic abundance indicates
   the influence of the marine environments adjacent to each site and the
   relative exposure of these coastlines to heavy surf, wind, waves and
   extreme weather events. Fish bone assemblages recovered from 6.4 mm
   screens had less inter-site variation in richness, evenness and rank
   order, but differences were noted in the rank order of fish taxa
   recovered from selective 3.2 mm screening of archaeological deposits
   when compared between sites. In contrast to patterns for molluscs,
   variation in the taxonomic composition of fish bone assemblages likely
   relates to site function, rather than the marine environments adjacent
   to each site. These trends highlight for the first time the complex
   range of factors that influenced the prehistoric acquisition of marine
   resources between leeward and windward islets, and document variation in
   prehistoric marine subsistence within one atoll. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Home gardens are an important topic for landscape research due to their
   intersectional contributions to plant diversity conservation and local
   livelihoods. As sites of ecological restoration, gardens transform
   small-scale landscapes toward higher plant richness and density. We
   examine "gardenscapes" on St. Eustatius, a small Caribbean island,
   focusing on how plants growing around a home contribute to ecological
   and ethnobotanical measures of plant diversity, and how residents value
   the importance of gardens to their livelihoods. Through a survey of 14
   gardenscapes and 11 home interviews, we report 277 plant species,
   including 31% native and 69% non-native, high plant densities and
   structural evenness, 260 plants with uses, and a total of 363 uses,
   especially as ornamental plants (184) and for other environmental
   services (16), but also food (101), health remedies (50), material uses
   (10) and symbolic services (2). Participants indicated that home
   gardening could be difficult due to drought and pests, but provided
   resources and incomes to livelihoods, especially through the production
   of food products. Several respondents reported that gardening was a
   declining activity on St. Eustatius, but this study shows how gardening
   activities offer a biocultural approach to conservation that supports
   plant diversity and livelihoods across the island's highly-modified
   natural landscape.

AB Analysis of in situ temperature records collected on six coral reefs in
   the Caribbean, Bahamas, and Florida Keys reveal significant variability
   across a range of temporal and spatial scales from minutes to seasons,
   across depths, and among sites. Subsurface variability occurring at
   daily and faster frequencies is prevalent across the region, likely
   driven by combinations of diurnal heating and cooling, wind driven
   advection, and internal waves at tidal and faster frequencies. This high
   frequency variability is not detected in records of remotely-sensed sea
   surface temperature alone. Diurnal variability likely caused by diurnal
   solar heating and cooling and possibly by advection associated with
   diurnal winds (daily sea breeze) was significant at all sites and showed
   greatest magnitude of variation at shallowest depths. Temperature
   fluctuations at tidal and faster frequencies were common at 5 out of the
   6 sites. The magnitude of this variability is not well explained by
   measured vertical temperature stratification combined with oscillations
   of the water column associated with barotropic surface tides. Rather,
   the magnitude and nature of the temperature changes point to the
   presence of internal waves generated at tidal and faster frequencies.
   Power spectra calculated seasonally show greatest variability within
   both diurnal and semi-diurnal frequency bands in Spring and Summer at
   Florida, Bahamas, Jamaica, and St. Croix. Variability within the
   semi-diurnal frequency band at Belize and Bonaire was greatest in
   Winter. Warming in Summer estimated as degree-hours per day above 29.0
   degrees C increased with increasing latitude and varied significantly
   among sites and depths in a manner not predictable from remotely sensed
   SST data alone. Site latitude was directly related to the amplitude of
   the seasonal thermal variability, but was not tightly related to
   variability at daily and faster frequencies which was greatest at the
   highest and lowest latitude sites. The interactions of depth, site, and
   season across the study region are associated with distinct signals of
   thermal variability, and have significant implications for the
   physiology and ecology of corals and other reef organisms.

AB Tropical forests worldwide are being fragmented at a rapid rate, causing
   a tremendous loss of biodiversity. Determining the impacts of forest
   disturbance and fragmentation on tropical biotas is therefore a central
   goal of conservation biology. We focused on bird communities in the
   interior (>100 m from forest edge) of forest fragments (300, 600, and
   1200 ha) in the lowlands of Papua New Guinea and compared them with
   those in continuous forest. We surveyed bird communities using point
   counts, mist-netting, and random walks, and measured habitat and
   microclimate characteristics at each site. We also surveyed
   leaf-dwelling arthropods, butterflies, and ants, and obtained diet
   samples from birds to examine food availability and food preferences. We
   recorded significantly fewer bird species per point in the 300-ha forest
   fragment than in other study sites. Overall, we recorded 80, 84, and 88
   species, respectively, in forest fragments, and 102 in continuous
   forest. Frugivores (especially large frugivores) and insectivores had
   lower species richness in forest fragments than continuous forest. Our
   results did not support the food scarcity hypothesis, that is, the
   decline of insectivorous birds in forest fragments is caused by an
   impoverished invertebrate prey base. We also found no significant
   differences among forest fragments and continuous forest in
   microclimates of forest interiors. Rather, we found that microhabitats
   preferred by sensitive birds (i.e., 30% of species with the strongest
   preferences for continuous forest) were less common in forest fragments
   (19%-31% of points) than in continuous forest (86% of points). Our
   results suggest that changes in microhabitats may make forest fragments
   unsuitable for sensitive species. However, limited dispersal
   capabilities could also make some species of birds less likely to
   disperse and occupy fragments. In addition, impoverished food resources,
   size of the forest fragment, or hunting pressure could contribute to the
   absence of large frugivorous birds in forest fragments. The forest
   fragments in our study, preserved as village-based protected areas, were
   not large enough to sustain the bird communities found in continuous
   forest. However, because these fragments still contained numerous bird
   species, preservation of such areas can be an important component of
   management strategies to conserve rainforests and birds in Papua New
   Guinea.

AB Caribbean rainfall and associated regional-scale ocean-atmosphere
   anomalies are analyzed during and after warm pool (WP) and cold tongue
   (CT) El Nio (EN) events (i.e. from the usual peak of EN events in boreal
   winter to next summer from 1950 to 2011). During and after a CT event, a
   north-south dipolar pattern with positive (negative) rainfall anomalies
   over the northern (southern) Caribbean during the boreal winter tends to
   reverse in spring, and then to vanish in summer. On the contrary, during
   and after a WP event, weak rainfall anomalies during the boreal winter
   intensify themselves from spring, with anomalous wet conditions over
   most of the Caribbean basin observed during summer, except over the
   eastern coast of Nicaragua and Costa Rica. The Caribbean rainfall
   anomalies associated with WP and CT events are shaped by competition
   between at least four different, but interrelated, mechanisms; (1) the
   near-equatorial large-scale subsidence anomaly over the equatorial
   Atlantic linked to the zonal adjustment of the Walker circulation; (2)
   the extra-tropical wave-like train combining positive phase of the
   Pacific/North American mode and negative phase of the North Atlantic
   Oscillation; (3) the wind-evaporation-sea surface temperature (SST)
   positive feedback coupling warmer-than-normal SST with
   weaker-than-normal low level easterlies over the tropical North
   Atlantic; and (4) the air-sea coupling between the speed of low level
   easterlies, including the Caribbean low level jet, and the SST anomaly
   (SSTA) gradient between the Caribbean basin and the eastern equatorial
   Pacific. It seems that Caribbean rainfall anomalies are shaped mostly by
   mechanisms (1-3) during CT events from the boreal winter to spring.
   These mechanisms seem less efficient during WP events when the
   atmospheric response seems driven mostly by mechanism (4), coupling
   positive west-east SSTA gradient with weaker-than-normal low level
   easterlies, and secondary by mechanism (3), from the boreal spring to
   summer.

AB REDD+ aims to offset greenhouse gas emissions through "Reduced Emissions
   from Deforestation and forest Degradation". Some authors suggest that
   REDD+ can bring additional benefits for biodiversity, namely for the
   conservation of extinction-prone restricted-range species. Here, we
   assess this claim, using Sao Tome Island (Democratic Republic of Sao
   Tome and Principe) as a case study. We quantified the abundance of bird
   and tree species, and calculated the aboveground carbon stocks across a
   gradient of land-use intensity. We found a strong spatial congruence
   between carbon and the presence and abundance of endemic species,
   supporting the potential of REDD+ to protect these taxa. We then
   assessed if REDD+ could help protect the forests of Sao Tome and
   Principe. To do so, we used OSIRIS simulations to predict country-level
   deforestation under two different REDD+ designs. These simulations
   showed that REDD+ could promote the loss of forests in Sao Tome and
   Principe through leakage. This happened even when additional payments
   for biodiversity were included in the simulations, and despite Sao Tome
   and Principe having the fourth highest carbon stocks per land area and
   the second highest biodiversity values according to the OSIRIS database.
   These results show weaknesses of OSIRIS as a planning tool, and
   demonstrate that the benefits that REDD+ might bring for biodiversity
   are strongly dependent on its careful implementation. We recommend that
   payment for ecosystem services programmes such as REDD+ develop
   safeguards to ensure that biodiversity co-benefits are met and perverse
   outcomes are avoided across all tropical countries. In particular, we
   advise specific safeguards regarding the conservation of
   extinction-prone groups, such as island restricted-range species.

AB The fallout from test BRAVO in March 1954 has had scientific, political,
   and social implications that have continued for more than 40 years. The
   test resulted in serious injury to the people of the Marshall Islands
   and 23 men on a nearby Japanese fishing boat, Prior to BRAVO there was
   insufficient appreciation of the dangers of fallout to people living
   downwind from surface or near-surface explosions of megaton weapons, In
   the absence of sufficient preplanning for fallout monitoring beyond the
   test-sites of earlier smaller yield tests, and as a result of the
   concern of the photographic film manufacturers, the Atomic Energy
   Commission Health and Safety Laboratory, now the Department of Energy
   Environmental Measurements Laboratory, was requested to develop a
   program of fallout surveillance. Beginning with Operation IVY in 1952,
   these surveys included aerial monitoring of the islands of the mid and
   western Pacific, as well as establishment of fallout monitoring stations
   in the United States and abroad, The first evidence of the post-BRAVO
   fallout was detected by a Atomic Energy Commission Health and Safety
   Laboratory instrument installed on the atoll of Rongerik, where 28
   military personnel were stationed. The results of radiation surveys
   conducted immediately after BRAVO, as well as the reports of medical
   investigations, radioecological studies, and dose reconstruction that
   have been conducted by many laboratories over the years have been
   available from the beginning in unclassified form, However, from the
   time of the fallout, and continuing to the present, there hal-e been
   many unanswered questions about what happened during the hours
   immediately after the fallout was reported, No formal investigation of
   the circumstances of the fallout was ever conducted, and there were
   serious misrepresentations of the facts in the official statements made
   at the time.

AB This paper examines vulnerability to climate change in the context of
   multiple stressors through a case study of Funafuti, Tuvalu. Climate
   change research in Pacific Islands has largely focused on biophysical
   changes such as sea-level rise. Less is known about how livelihoods are
   affected and what adaptation options are realistic. The research employs
   a vulnerability framework to identify where climate fits in the suite of
   forces (socioeconomic, cultural, environmental) already affecting
   livelihoods. The participatory approach includes semi-structured
   interviews with community members, initially without reference to
   climate. Key areas of concern to people in Funafuti are economic, food,
   water and overcrowding, rather than climate change. Vulnerability to
   changing climatic conditions is evident in water, land, and food through
   the interaction of non-climatic forces (e.g. overcrowding, urbanization,
   few economic opportunities, changing land use, and shifting cultural
   norms), and climatic forces (e.g. dry spells, extreme sea-levels, strong
   winds and changing marine conditions). Adaptations, beyond bearing the
   effects and sharing the burden, are mainly reactive and short-term.
   Future changes in climate will be experienced in the context of these
   multiple, interacting forces, and adaptation initiatives will need to be
   designed in light of these. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Here we investigate microplastics contamination on beaches of four
   islands of the Lesser Antilles (Anguilla, St. Barthelemy, St. Eustatius
   and St. Martin/Maarten). These islands are close to the North Atlantic
   subtropical gyre, which contains high levels of microplastics. On
   average 261 +/- 6 microplastics/kg of dry sand were found, with a
   maximum of 620 +/- 96 microplastics on Grandes Cayes, Saint Martin. The
   vast majority of these microplastics (> 95%) were fibers. Levels of
   microplastics differed among islands, with significantly lower levels
   found in St. Eustatius compared to the other Islands. No difference in
   microplastic levels was found between windward and leeward beaches. Our
   research provides a detailed study on microplastics on beaches in the
   Lesser Antilles. These results are important in developing a deeper
   understanding of the extent of the microplastic challenge within the
   Caribbean region, a hotspot of biodiversity.

AB Uncertainties in species definitions can have important consequences for
   biodiversity conservation because taxonomic rank is used as a criterion
   to assess the conservation priorities of threatened organisms. The
   Vulnerable St Lucia whiptail lizard Cnemidophorus vanzoi, considered a
   single species, is the sole representative of its genus in the Caribbean
   region, found on Maria Major and Maria Minor islands off the coast of St
   Lucia. However, a recent study revealed significant morphological and
   phylogenetic differences between the two populations and recommended
   they should be managed as two separate entities. We surveyed the two
   populations and estimated them to comprise 1,985 and 29 individuals on
   Maria Major and Minor, respectively. The Maria Minor population is
   currently at a critically low level and consequently highly susceptible
   to demographic and genetic stochasticity and catastrophic events, in
   particular the colonization of invasive mammalian predators. If our goal
   is to conserve biodiversity and evolutionary potential we face a dilemma
   in formulating the optimum strategy for the management of these two
   threatened populations on the species boundary. We discuss some
   potential management options but also raise this issue for discussion in
   the conservation biology community.

AB This paper considers the relationship between persons, land and food as
   seen in the sociality of public gatherings and gardening spaces. For
   Biangai speakers in the Upper Bulolo Valley of Morobe Province (Papua
   New Guinea), intimacies of place are often read through the work of
   tending to the land, the symbolic association of crops and people as
   well as rituals where male and female persons are made. By examining the
   intersection of taste and place in a public multi-language gathering,
   the paper offers a critical assessment of the French concept of le gout
   du terroir, or the taste of place, suggesting that tastes matter
   substantially in defining intergroup sociality. The paper reveals the
   significance of terroir for organising and strengthening group identity
   in Papua New Guinea, and its problematic extension to ideas of national
   foodviews. Ultimately, it is argued that such grounding informs how
   Biangai imagine the nation and its public places.

AB Caribbean coral reefs are biodiversity-rich habitats which provide
   numerous ecosystem services with both ecological and economical values,
   but nowadays they are severely degraded. In particular, populations of
   the major framework-building coral Orbicella faveolata have declined
   sharply, and therefore, understanding how these threatened coral
   populations are interconnected and how demographic changes have impacted
   their genetic diversity is essential for their management and
   conservation. Previous population genetic surveys showed that gene flow
   in this species is sometimes locally restricted in the Caribbean;
   however, little genetic data are available for Cuban populations. Here,
   we analyzed the variation at the mitochondrial DNA control region and
   six microsatellite loci from O. faveolata colonies from five distant
   localities representing most of the main coral reefs around Cuba. Both
   genetic markers showed evidence of genetic differentiation between the
   northwestern area (Colorados Archipelago) and the other reefs. Colonies
   from the Colorados Archipelago harbored the largest number of unique
   mtDNA haplotypes and microsatellite alleles, which suggests long-term
   large population size or gene flow from other areas of the Caribbean.
   These results indicate that the Colorados Archipelago area is
   particularly important for O. faveolata populations and it is well
   suited for reef management and restoration efforts.

AB A numerical model for the global tsunamis computation constructed by
   KOWALIK et al. (2005), is applied to the tsunami of 26 December, 2004 in
   the World Ocean from 80 degrees S to 69 degrees N with spatial
   resolution of one minute. Because the computational domain includes
   close to 200 million grid points, a parallel version of the code was
   developed and run on a Cray X1 supercomputer. An energy flux function is
   used to investigate energy transfer from the tsunami source to the
   Atlantic and Pacific Oceans. Although the first energy input into the
   Pacific Ocean was the primary (direct) wave, reflections from the Sri
   Lankan and eastern shores of Maldives were a larger source. The tsunami
   travelled from Indonesia, around New Zealand, and into the Pacific Ocean
   by various routes. The direct path through the deep ocean to North
   America carried miniscule energy, while the stronger signal travelled a
   considerably longer distance via South Pacific ridges as these
   bathymetric features amplified the energy flux vectors. Travel times for
   these amplified energy fluxes are much longer than the arrival of the
   first wave. These large fluxes are organized in the wave-like form when
   propagating between Australia and Antarctica. The sources for the larger
   fluxes are multiple reflections from the Seychelles, Maldives and a
   slower direct signal from the Bay of Bengal. The energy flux into the
   Atlantic Ocean shows a different pattern since the energy is pumped into
   this domain through the directional properties of the source function.
   The energy flow into the Pacific Ocean is approximately 75% of the total
   flow to the Atlantic Ocean. In many locations along the Pacific and
   Atlantic coasts, the first arriving signal, or forerunner, has lower
   amplitude than the main signal which often is much delayed.
   Understanding this temporal distribution is important for an application
   to tsunami warning and prediction.

   and polychaetes, and to a lower extent by crabs, galatheids, gastropods,
   nematodes, ophiuroids and fishes. Data analyses showed that (i)
   composition of symbiont assemblages remained similar within a

   remained similar among sampling sites), (ii) the co-occurrence of
   symbiotic species was not lower than if expected only by chance (i.e.,
   there was no negative interactions between the symbionts), (iii) the
   number of shrimps on a crinoid was correlated with the size of the
   crinoid, (iv) symbionts are composed of species-specific, selective and
   opportunistic species, and (v) host-specificity of myzostomids was
   greater than for shrimps or polychaetes.

AB Anemia is a significant risk factor for poor health outcomes for both
   the mother and neonate; however, the determinants of anemia in many
   epidemiological settings are poorly understood. Using a subset of a
   nationally representative cluster survey (2010 Demographic and Health
   Survey) in combination with other non-contemporaneous survey data, the
   epidemiology of anemia among women of reproductive age in Timor-Leste
   has been explored. Logistic regression was used to identify risk
   factors, population-level impacts were estimated as population
   attributable fractions and spatial analytics were used to identify
   regions of highest risk. The DHS survey found that similar to 21% of
   adult women in Timor-Leste are anemic (49,053; 95% CI: 37,095 to
   61,035), with hemoglobin <12.0 g/dL. In this population, the main risk
   factors (adjusted odds ratio; 95% CI) are: currently abstaining from sex
   for any reason (2.25; 1.50 to 3.38); illiteracy (2.04; 1.49 to 2.80);
   giving birth within the previous year (1.80; 1.29 to 2.51); consumption
   of fruits/vegetables low in vitamin A (1.57; 1.13 to 2.20); and the
   district-level confirmed malaria incidence (1.31; 1.15 to 1.49). A
   review of prior soil-transmitted helminth surveys in Timor-Leste
   indicates low-to-moderate prevalence with generally low egg counts,
   suggesting a limited impact on anemia in this setting, although
   comprehensive survey data are lacking. Examination of the
   population-level effects highlights the impacts of both recent births
   and malaria on anemia, with more limited impacts from diet; the evidence
   does not suggest a large contribution from geohelminths within
   Timor-Leste. These patterns are divergent from some other settings in
   the Asia-Pacific region and highlight the need for further focused
   research. Targeting high-burden districts and by increasing access to
   pre/postnatal care, raising literacy levels, increasing access to family
   planning, and improving malaria control should be prioritized to
   maximize inherently limited health budgets in reaching these
   populations.

AB Caribbean islands such as the Bahamas, Grenada and St. Lucia are
   affected yearly by seasonal hurricanes and tropical storms which can
   lead to blackouts and voltage variations of the power system. The
   Bahamas in particular consists of 16 isolated island grids which
   inhabits a population of 300,000. Diesel generators are employed to
   provide electricity for each island, but with increasing oil prices, and
   maintenance cost the Bahamas Electricity Corporations faces a huge loss
   on electricity generation in the millions of dollars each year. To
   decrease this loss and to improve the power quality of the system,
   distributed generation systems are being sought after. This paper
   investigates the effects of utilizing renewable energy sources on the
   island of New Providence, Bahamas and analyzing various load shedding
   schemes on the system in the instance of a disturbance due to a natural
   disaster. A report of the New Providence Transmission system was used in
   modeling the 132kV grid system using the Electrical Transient Analyzer
   Program 12.0 (ETAP) environment to perform a load flow and transient
   analysis for reducing power losses in the transmission system and
   improving reliability of the Bahamian distribution system.

AB The model marine crenarchaeote 'Cenarchaeum symbiosum' is until now the

   phylogenetic analyses based on the 16S rRNA and ammonia monooxygenase
   subunit A (amoA) genes revealed the presence of putative
   ammonia-oxidizing archaea (AOA) in a diverse range of sponges from the
   western Pacific, Caribbean and Mediterranean. amoA diversity was limited
   even between different oceans, with many of the obtained sequences
   (75.9%; n(total) = 83) forming a monophyletic, apparently sponge- (and
   coral-) specific lineage, analogous to those previously inferred from
   comparative 16S rRNA gene studies of sponge-associated microbes. The
   presence of AOA in sponge larvae, as detected by 16S rRNA and amoA PCR
   assays as well as by fluorescence in situ hybridization, suggests they
   are vertically transmitted and thus might be of importance for ammonia
   detoxification within the sponge.

AB The Tinhosas islands, in Sao Tome e Principe, host the most important
   seabird breeding colony in the Gulf of Guinea, but information on its
   conservation status was hitherto unpublished or anecdotal, the last
   assessment having been performed in 1997. A two-day expedition to the
   Tinhosas islands was undertaken to estimate the status of breeding
   seabirds in 2013. Four of the five seabird species known to breed in Sao
   Tome e Principe, namely Brown Booby Sula leucogaster, Sooty Tern
   Onychoprion fuscatus, Brown Noddy Anous stolidus and Black Noddy Anous
   minutus, occur on the Tinhosas. A decrease of 80% in Brown Booby
   numbers, possibly due to occasional exploitation, and a 30% increase in
   Sooty Tern and Black Noddy numbers, were found compared to 1997 data
   although survey methods differed. Breeding of Brown Noddy and Madeiran
   Storm-petrel Hydrobates castro remains unconfirmed. Our estimates
   confirmed that BirdLife International Important Bird and Biodiversity
   Area criteria are met for at least one species, the Sooty Tern. The
   islands are not legally protected, nonetheless, apart from moderate
   levels of disturbance by fishermen who land on Tinhosa Grande, no alien
   species were seen, and no immediate threats to the Tinhosas colony were
   detected. Multiple visits within and between years are recommended, to
   census breeders, monitor threats and establish breeding phenologies.

AB The Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) encompasses the heaviest rain
   belt on the Earth. Few direct long-term records, especially in the
   Pacific, limit our understanding of long-term natural variability for
   predicting future ITCZ migration. Here we present a tropical
   precipitation record from the Southern Hemisphere covering the past
   282,000 years, inferred from a marine sedimentary sequence collected off
   the eastern coast of Papua New Guinea. Unlike the precession paradigm
   expressed in its East Asian counterpart, our record shows that the
   western Pacific ITCZ migration was influenced by combined precession and
   obliquity changes. The obliquity forcing could be primarily delivered by
   a cross-hemispherical thermal/pressure contrast, resulting from the
   asymmetric continental configuration between Asia and Australia in a
   coupled East Asian-Australian circulation system. Our finding suggests
   that the obliquity forcing may play a more important role in global
   hydroclimate cycles than previously thought.

AB The timing of reef platform emergence and the detailed chronology of
   reef island development provides a powerful backdrop for constraining
   the earliest period possible for prehistoric human colonization of
   low-lying atolls. Since Pacific atolls consist of biogenetic sediments,
   we dated foraminifera sands composed of well-preserved shallow-water
   species that are reliable indicators of facies formation. From transect
   excavations across the largest islet of Utrok Atoll (11 degrees 13'N,
   169 degrees 50'E) and Maloelap Atoll (8 degrees 47'N, 171 degrees 05'E),
   Marshall Islands, we selected nine foraminifera dating samples and five
   charcoal samples from prehistoric ovens in well-defined cultural layers
   and charcoal from buried A horizons. We document that: 1) the largest
   islets of Utrok and Maloelap atolls expanded towards the lagoon shore at
   a rate of similar to 70 m/kyr and similar to 200m/kyr, respectively; 2)
   foraminifera sands immediately below buried A horizons in the islet's
   "core" areas represents the timing of islet development at similar to
   2750 and similar to 2400 cal BP, respectively; and 3) the oldest
   cultural dates (1850 and 1790 cal BP, similar to 900-600 years younger
   than islet development) indicates that occupation much older than 2000
   cal BP is unlikely, which is supported by sea level falling from its
   high stands to the present levels around 2000 cal BP for the
   northwestern Pacific.

AB New Scissurellidae and Anatomidae from the geographic and political
   Americas are described, with many long-standing misidentifications being
   corrected, and some comparisons to described species complementing the
   contribution. Sinezona kayae n.sp., previously mis-identified as the
   South African Sin. insignis, and Sin. hawaiiensis n.sp. without a
   selenizone, are described from Hawaii. Sinezona carolarum n.sp. is added
   to the Panamic province with a more depressed shell than the more common
   Sin. rimuloides (Carpenter, 1865), and a proportionally shorter
   selenizone. Coronadoa demisispira n.sp. from the Panamic and
   northeastern Pacific provinces is the third species in the genus, living
   sympatrically in the southern range of C. simonsae Bartsch, 1946. The
   new species is characterized by a shell with lower profile and a wider
   umbilicus. Anatoma alternatisculpta n.sp. from the Caribbean is most
   similar to A. proxima (Dall, 1927), but has conspicuously different
   sculpture on shoulder and base. Anatoma plicatazona n.sp. from the
   Caribbean has markedly upturned keels of the selenizone. Anatoma
   disciformis (Golikov & Sirenko, 1980) is reported from Alaska and
   illustrated for the first time by SEM. Thieleella kelseyi (Dall, 1905)
   is resurrected for what has previously been misidentified as the
   European Anatoma crispata (Fleming, 1828) in the northeastern Pacific,
   with a neotype designated, as the holotype is missing. Thieleella
   peruviana n. sp. from Peru is similar to T. kelseyi but has a taller
   shell and differs in the morphology of lateral tooth 5 of the radula.
   Thieleella bathypacifica n. sp. from the Panamic province is a
   deep-water species (2500 m), and known from a single specimen only. The
   species shows a marked angulation on teleoconch I at the spiral cord in
   the position of the selenizone; additionally it has a radula with
   marginal teeth showing a distinct posterior food groove. The bodies of
   two species (T. kelseyi, T. peruviana) were examined by SEM. An
   accessory cephalic tentacle between the anterior most epipodial tentacle
   and the eye stalk was encountered. The epipodial sense organ is
   recognized for the first time in Anatomidae, and the presence of
   bursicles on the gill is confirmed.

AB The variability of the Caribbean Current is studied in terms of the
   influence on its dynamics of the freshwater inflow from the Orinoco and
   Amazon rivers. Sea-surface salinity maps of the eastern Caribbean and
   SeaWiFS color images show that a freshwater plume from the Orinoco and
   Amazon Rivers extends seasonally northwestward across the Caribbean
   basin, from August to November, 3-4 months after the peak of the
   seasonal rains in northeastern South America. The plume is sustained by
   two main inflows from the North Brazil Current and its current rings.
   The southern inflow enters the Caribbean Sea south of Grenada Island and
   becomes the main branch of the Caribbean Current in the southern
   Caribbean. The northern inflow (14 degrees N) passes northward around
   the Grenadine Islands and St. Vincent. As North Brazil Current rings
   stall and decay east of the Lesser Antilles, between 14 degrees N and 18
   degrees N, they release freshwater into the northern part of the eastern
   Caribbean Sea merging with inflow from the North Equatorial Current.
   Velocity vectors derived from surface drifters in the eastern Caribbean
   indicate three westward flowing jets: (1) the southern and fastest at I
   I 'N; (2) the center and second fastest at 14 degrees N; (3) the
   northern and slowest at 17 degrees N. The center jet (14 degrees N)
   flows faster between the months of August and December and is located
   near the southern part of the freshwater plume. Using the MICOM North
   Atlantic simulation, it is shown that the Caribbean Current is
   seasonally intensified near 14 degrees N, partly by the inflow of river
   plumes. Three to four times more anticyclonic eddies are formed during
   August-December, which agrees with a pronounced rise in the number of
   anticyclonic looper days in the drifter data then. A climatology-forced
   regional simulation embedding only the northern (14 degrees N) Caribbean
   Current (without the influence of the vorticity of the NBC rings), using
   the ROMS model, shows that the low salinity plume coincides with a
   negative potential vorticity anomaly that intensifies the center jet
   located at the salinity front. The jet forms cyclones south of the
   plume, which are moved northwestward as the anticyclonic circulation
   intensifies in the eastern Caribbean Sea, north of 14 degrees N.
   Friction on the shelves of the Greater Antilles also generates cyclones,
   which propagate westward and eastward from 67 degrees W. (C) 2007

AB We have dated Huon Peninsula, Papua New Guinea and Barbados corals that
   formed at times since the Last Interglacial Period, applying both Th-230
   and Pa-231 dating techniques as a test of age accuracy. We show that
   Marine Isotope Stage (MIS) 5e ended prior to 113.1 +/- 0.7 kyr, when sea
   level was -19 m. During MIS 5b sea level was -57 m at 92.6 +/- 0.5 kyr,
   having dropped about 40 in in approximately 10 kyr during the MIS 5c-5b
   transition. Sea level then rose more than 40 in during the MIS 5b-5a
   transition, also in about 10 kyr. MIS 5a lasted until at least 76.2 +/-
   0.4 kyr, at a level of -24 m at that time. Combined with earlier data
   that places MIS 4 sea level at -81 m at 70.8 kyr, our late MIS 5a data
   indicate that sea level fell almost 60 m in less than 6 kyr (10.6 m/kyr)
   during the MIS 5-4 transition. The magnitude of the drop is half that of
   the glacial-interglacial amplitude and approximately equivalent to the
   volume of the present-day Antarctic Ice Sheet. During this interval the
   minimum average rate of net continental ice accumulation was 18 cm/yr,
   likely facilitated by efficient moisture transport from lower latitudes.
   At three specific times (60.6 +/- 0.3, 50.8 +/- 0.3, and 36.8+0.2 kyr)
   during MIS 3, sea level was between -85 and -74 m. Sea level then
   dropped to -107 m at 23.7 +/- 0.1 kyr early in MIS 2, before dropping
   further to Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) values and then rising to present
   values during the last deglaciation. Times of rapid sea-level drop
   correspond to times of high winter insolation at low northern latitudes
   and high winter latitudinal gradients in northern hemisphere insolation,
   supporting the idea that these factors may have resulted in high
   water-vapor pressure in moisture sources and efficient moisture
   transport to high-latitude glaciers, thereby contributing to glacial
   buildup. We combined our sea-level results with deep-sea delta(18)O
   records as a means of estimating the temperature and ice-volume
   components in the marine delta(18)O record. This analysis confirms large
   deep-ocean temperature shifts following MIS 5e and during Termination I.
   Deep-ocean temperatures changed by much smaller amounts between MIS 5c
   and 2. Maximum temperature shift in the deep Pacific is about 2degrees,
   whereas the shift at a site in the Atlantic is 4degrees. Under glacial
   conditions temperatures at both sites are near the freezing point. The
   shift in the Atlantic is likely caused by a combination of changing
   proportions of northern and southern source waters as well as changing
   temperature at the sites where these deep waters form. (C) 2002 Elsevier

   in a coastal meromictic lake (Lake Nagada, Papua New Guinea). During the
   day, the animals migrate several metres below the oxycline to just above
   or into the sediments, and remain in anoxic water. Vertical migration
   patterns differ between ontogenetic stages; adults and larger
   copepodites do not occur in appreciable numbers in the water samples
   during the day (deepest sample taken at similar to 0.5 m above the
   sediment). Around sunset, the larger copepodites gradually appear in the
   water column, reaching the near-surface food layer (0-2 m) only well
   after sunset. Our results suggest that the evening ascent of the
   copepods in this tropical lake is related to relative changes in light
   intensity, and that there are age- and sex-related differences in the
   responses to these stimuli.

AB Working through a Caribbean case study, this paper examines the networks
   and associations of Fair Trade bananas as they move both materially and
   morally from farms in St Vincent and the Grenadines to supermarkets and
   households in the United Kingdom. In doing so, the paper provides
   grounded empirical evidence of Fair Trade's moral economy as experienced
   by banana producers in the Caribbean. The paper follows Nancy Fraser's
   distinction between ways of framing justice to argue that, in order to
   transcend its complex postcolonial positionalities, the Fair Trade
   Foundation needs to include recognition in its moral economy as well as
   representation and redistribution. The paper compares the moral
   framework of Fair Trade as an ideology and social movement with the
   lived experience of certified Fairtrade banana farmers in the Windward
   Islands who work mostly for, rather than within, an idealized moral
   economy. The paper also contributes to several recent debates in the
   agri-food literature exploring the interconnections between production
   and consumption, the role of materiality in contemporary food networks,
   the historical and (post)colonial nature of food moralities, and links
   between political and moral economies of food. Following an outline of
   recent debates about the moral economies of food and its relation to
   Fair Trade as a movement, the paper dissects the moral economy of the
   Fairtrade Foundation, highlighting the historical and geographical,
   material and symbolic, gendered and generational ways that food
   producers in the Global South (in this case, banana farmers in St
   Vincent and the Grenadines) may be counterposed to 'responsible'
   consumers in the Global North. Despite the good intentions of those who
   promote the Fair Trade movement through the Fairtrade Foundation and the
   Fairtrade Labelling Organisation (FLO), our case study reveals a moral
   economy of non- (or partial) recognition, which has a range of
   unintended consequences and paradoxical effects. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Populations of the staghorn coral, Acropora cervicornis, collapsed
   throughout the Caribbean region from the late 1970s through the 1990s.
   We tested the hypothesis that this recent, multidecadal interruption in
   coral growth was a novel event in the late Holocene. Eight cores,
   extracted from a lagoonal reef in Discovery Bay, Jamaica dated to
   440-1260 CalBP and consisted almost entirely of A. cervicornis rubble.
   The A. cervicornis in the cores showed significantly less internal
   bioerosion than A. cervicornis from modern death assemblages in
   Discovery Bay, indicating generally shorter post-mortem exposure at the
   sediment-water interface in the past. A. cervicornis grew continuously
   and was buried rapidly during the millennium preceding the 1980s, with
   the exception of a possible hiatus in growth and burial at some point
   300-600 years ago. In the 1980s, a combination of perturbations, which
   included overfishing and (possibly) other forms of human interference,
   caused an unprecedented disruption in the growth and burial of staghorn
   coral populations in Discovery Bay.

AB The toxins involved in ciguatera (fish poisoning) in the Caribbean Sea
   were isolated from Caranx latus, a pelagic fish often implicated in
   ciguatera in the Caribbean region, and purified by mouse bioassay
   directed fractionation. Five toxins were separated by reverse-phase
   high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). In order of increasing
   hydrophobicity, these toxins included a sleep-inducing fraction ( < 1%
   of total toxicity), a major Caribbean ciguatoxin (C-CTX-1, 65% of
   toxicity), a minor Caribbean ciguatoxin (C-CTX-2, 13% of toxicity), a
   minor toxin ( similar to 1% of toxicity) and a hydrophobic, fast-acting
   toxin ( similar to 19% of toxicity), The i.p. injection into mice of
   each toxin induced signs typical of site-5 sodium channel activator
   toxins such as the Pacific ciguatoxins and brevetoxins, C-CTX-1 and
   C-CTX-2 were purified to homogeneity (LD50 = 3.6 and similar to 1 mu
   g/kg, respectively) and subjected to ionspray mass spectrometry. Both
   lost up to five H2O molecules and each had a [M + H](+) ion, m/z 1141.7,
   suggesting that C-CTX-1 and -2 are diastereomers that differ from the
   Pacific family of ciguatoxins. Turbo-assisted HPLC-mass spectrometry
   identified C-CTX-1, C-CTX-2 and three C-CTX-1-related compounds in an
   enriched fraction but no Pacific ciguatoxins were detected. The presence
   of different families of ciguatoxins in ciguateric fish from the
   Caribbean Sea and Pacific Ocean probably underlies the clinical
   differences in the ciguatera syndrome reported in these two regions, A
   Caribbean strain of the benthic dinoflagellate, Gambierdiscus toxicus,
   is suspected as source of these ciguatoxins. The extent to which these
   toxins are biotransformed as they pass through the marine food chain
   remains to be determined. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science Ltd.

AB In order to investigate zoogeographical patterns of the marine
   elasmobranch species of Colombia, species richness of the Pacific and
   Caribbean and their subareas (Coastal Pacific, Oceanic Pacific, Coastal
   Caribbean, Oceanic Caribbean) was analyzed. The areas shared 10
   families, 10 genera and 16 species of sharks, and eight families, three
   genera and four species of batoids. Carcharhinidae had the highest
   contribution to shark richness, whereas Rajidae and Urotrygonidae had
   the greatest contribution to batoid richness in the Caribbean and
   Pacific, respectively. Most elasmobranchs were associated with benthic
   and coastal habitats. The similarity analysis allowed the identification
   of five groups of families, which characterize the elasmobranch richness
   in both areas. Beta diversity indicated that most species turnover
   occurred between the Coastal Pacific and the two Caribbean subareas. The
   difference in species richness and composition between areas may be due
   to vicariant events such as the emergence of the Isthmus of Panama. It
   is unlikely that the Colombian elasmobranch diversity originated from a
   single colonization event. Local diversification/speciation, dispersal
   from the non-tropical regions of the Americas, a Pacific dispersion and
   an Atlantic dispersion are origin possibilities without any of them
   excluding the others.

   (Antennarius and Antennatus) and five species in the Eastern Pacific.
   All the species are known from Colombian waters, with the exception of
   antenanrius coccineus. In this study we review the family Antenariidae
   in Colombia, based on the examination of 51 specimens. Antennarius
   radiosus is first recorded from the Colombian Caribbean, based on two
   specimens collected with trawls at 20 m depth in Buritaca (Magdalena)
   and Isla Fuerte (Cordoba). Antennarius radiosus, Antennarius
   bermudensis, Antennarius multiocellatus, Antennarius ocellatus and
   Antennarius pauciradiatus are restricted to the Western Atlantic. The
   most common species found in Colombian seas are antennarius striatus in
   the Caribbean and antennarius avalonis in the Pacific. Histrio histrio
   is the only species with an almost circumglobal distribution. A key to
   identify antenariid ishes from Colombia is provided.

AB Ethnopharmacological relevance: Traditional knowledge of medicinal plant
   use in many regions of Papua New Guinea and the Autonomous Region of
   Bougainville is poorly described and rapidly disappearing. A program
   initiated by the University of Papua New Guinea to systematically
   document and preserve traditional knowledge of medicinal plant use was
   initiated with WHO help in 2001.
   Aim of the study: To document and compare medicinal plant use in the
   Siwai and Buin districts of the Island of Bougainville. Siwai and Buin
   districts represent two adjacent geographic regions of differing
   language traditions.
   Materials and methods: This report is a combination of two University of
   Papua New Guinea reports generated using a University of Papua New
   Guinea and Papua New Guinea Department of Health approved survey
   questionnaire "Information sheet on traditional herbal reparations and
   medicinal plants of Papua New Guinea".
   Results: Although Siwai and Buin districts are adjacent in Southern
   Bougainville, there is considerable variation in the specific plants
   used medicinally and the specific uses of those plants that are used
   commonly in the two regions. In addition, many of the plants used in the
   region are widely distributed species that are used medicinally in other
   settings. Nevertheless, the high endemicity of plants and the
   extraordinary cultural diversity in the Autonomous Region of
   Bougainville has yielded description of the medicinal use of many plants
   that have not previously been reported in the wider scientific
   literature.
   Conclusions: Efforts to document and preserve traditional knowledge of
   plant use in Papua New Guinea have yielded important new records of
   plants with potential application in the provision of health care for a
   developing nation with an under developed Western style rural health
   care system. This report documents substantial commonality in the
   general modes of medicinal plant preparation and in the health care
   applications of plant use in the Siwai and Buin traditions, however,
   there was considerable difference noted in the particular uses of the
   specific plants used in one or another of the districts. (C) 2011

AB Extinct species analyzed in zooarchaeological studies are often
   organized into broader taxonomic categories due to their absence in
   comparative collections or limited taxonomic knowledge. However, current
   taxonomic and phylogenetic research is constantly challenging
   zooarchaeological analysis to provide more accurate identifications and
   offers the opportunity to reassess these categories. These concerns can
   be addressed by increasing zooarchaeological publications with detailed
   morphological descriptions of analyzed specimens and reevaluating
   identifications of previously analyzed zooarchaeological collections
   with updated phylogenetic and taxonomic information. I present a case
   study from Grenada, WI to show the importance of reevaluating
   zooarchaeological taxonomic categories and how this impacts
   archaeological interpretations. Recent morphological and phylogenetic
   analyses of Lesser Antilles rice rats, particularly of giant rice rat
   phylogenies, have reconciled some difficulties with their
   identification. New preliminary identifications with morphological
   descriptions are presented and reveal that Grenada had greater rice rat
   diversity than was previously recognized in pre-Columbian archaeological
   contexts, including evidence for possible human assisted translocations.
   These conclusions also highlight the value of museum collections and the
   contribution zooarchaeology can make to biodiversity research.

AB Lionfish (Pterois volitans/miles) have invaded the majority of the
   Caribbean region within five years. As voracious predators of native
   fishes with a broad habitat distribution, lionfish are poised to cause
   an unprecedented disruption to coral reef diversity and function.
   Controls of lionfish densities within its native range are poorly
   understood, but they have been recorded in the stomachs of large-bodied
   Caribbean groupers. Whether grouper predation of lionfish is sufficient
   to act as a biocontrol of the invasive species is unknown, but pest
   biocontrol by predatory fishes has been reported in other ecosystems.
   Groupers were surveyed along a chain of Bahamian reefs, including one of
   the region's most successful marine reserves which supports the top one
   percentile of Caribbean grouper biomass. Lionfish biomass exhibited a
   7-fold and non-linear reduction in relation to the biomass of grouper.
   While Caribbean grouper appear to be a biocontrol of invasive lionfish,
   the overexploitation of their populations by fishers, means that their
   median biomass on Caribbean reefs is an order of magnitude less than in
   our study. Thus, chronic overfishing will probably prevent natural
   biocontrol of lionfishes in the Caribbean.

AB This paper examines the particular shape taken by a modern instance of
   'Third World' feminism. In Papua New Guinea, an emerging nexus between
   grassroots female activism and Christian churches is helping to liberate
   and empower some female citizens in a state which in practice has
   neglected women's interests and gender relations despite early national
   rhetoric about the importance of women to nation-building. Tracing the
   origins of modern women's fellowship groups to the early work of female
   missionaries with indigenous women, the paper considers the increasing
   politicization of women's organizations during the last two decades as
   they expand their 'traditional' preoccupation with spiritual, domestic,
   and welfare matters to embrace wider social, political, and human rights
   issues. In the course of surveying church women's groupings in Papua New
   Guinea, the paper looks specifically at the National Council of Women,
   women's groups in East New Britain Province, the United Church Women's
   Fellowship, and women's involvements in the developing ecumenical
   movement. The paper concludes by contrasting the class dimensions of
   grassroots Christian women's activism to official denial of the
   existence of class differentiation or exploitation in this purportedly
   egalitarian Melanesian state.

   of New Guinea were explored using direct canopy access and tuna bait
   traps. The 19 trees investigated were occupied by 21 ant species of
   which 18 were canopy inhabitants. On average only 3.6 ant species per
   tree and 3 species per bait were found. Height of bait position was
   positively related to ant species richness, with the upper parts of the
   canopy being occupied by the highest number of species. On the other
   hand, tree species and study site did not have any effect on ant species
   richness nor on structure of the ant assemblages. Ant species appeared
   to be distributed randomly and we did not detect any effect of distance
   on similarity of ant assemblage occurring on the trees. The dominant
   species (Crematogaster polita) had certain negative effects on the
   presence of some species at food sources co-occurring at the same tree,
   but it did co-occur with the other ants to some extent as well. The
   majority of species found in the canopy were generalist omnivores
   (depending mainly on trophobionts or plant exudates).

AB Island freshwater habitats are colonised by amphidromous fish, which
   display an oceanic larval phase while the rest of their life cycle takes
   place in rivers. In the present study we evaluated the population
   structure of the widespread Sicyopterus lagocephalus (Gobioidei) over
   its Indo-Pacific distribution range, which encompasses the island chain
   (Indonesia - Papua New Guinea - Malaysia) known as the Indo-Pacific
   Barrier (IPB). Additional analysis of 2 endemic species, S. aiensis
   (Vanuatu) and S. sarasini (New Caledonia), living in sympatry with S.
   lagocephalus, represented comparative material and was used as the basis
   for an assessment of endemism and dispersal. Mitochondrial cytochrome b
   sequence data were obtained for 332 S. lagocephalus, 210 S. aiensis and
   87 S. sarasini across each species' range. Haplotype networks and
   F-statistics were used to determine patterns of population structure. A
   discrete phylogeographic diffusion model under a time-scaled coalescent
   tree prior was used to assess the history of the spatial expansion of S.
   lagocephalus across its wide spatial distribution. S. lagocephalus
   demonstrates high population structure across the IPB. It also displays
   a strong structure between Tahiti and all other locations sampled. No
   other population structure was identified in the entire western Pacific.
   Phylogenetic reconstruction and coalescence analysis indicate that the
   oldest population originated in the western Pacific, from which the
   eastern Pacific and the Indian Oceans were colonised. For the 2 endemic
   species, no genetic structure was identified across their respective
   ranges. From the genetic results associated with known elements of the
   life history of these species, we improved our understanding of the
   simultaneous existence of geographically close endemic species and a
   widespread species.

AB This paper describes features of terrestrial and aquatic biodiversity in
   Papua New Guinea, current efforts at local, national and international
   levels to conserve species-rich areas and the socioeconomic and cultural
   constraints and conflicts behind those efforts. Undocumented customary
   land tenure, resource development and environmental degradation and the
   growth in human populations and their aspirations are identified as
   issues requiring specific solutions. Education, financial support for
   conservation initiatives and poor information transfer from gatherers to
   decision-makers are impediments to achieving ecological sustainability.
   Conflict resolution lies in the design of conservation measures
   specifically appropriate to PNG. Compromise is required between the
   advantages of coordination at the national level (top-down) and those
   gained through initiatives stimulated through dialogue with stakeholders
   (bottom-up). Education (both formal and informal) and the dissemination
   of relevant information are regarded as keystones in conservation
   efforts. Conservation agencies should prepare sustainable development
   plans for areas regarded as worthy of conservation and incorporate the
   biological merits, social impacts and sustainable economic potential of
   selected areas.

AB The driving force behind the mixed-methods ethnoprimatological endeavor
   is to effectively conserve nonhuman primates. In this article, I argue
   that ethnoprimatological research can meet this goal only by discarding
   the purely science views of conservation that dominate the current
   literature. By considering more than local ecological perceptions, their
   ideological agendas, and their levels of power via a political ecology
   framework, ethnoprimatologists can simultaneously socialize the
   ecosystems we study and contribute our ethological skills to advance
   traditionally humanist disciplines' increased attention to a wider field
   of agents and structures that matter. I support these arguments through
   an examination of farmer-green monkey (Chlorocebus sabaeus) relations in
   St. Kitts. Kittitian farmers' narrative revealed three scales that
   collectively construct what is locally known as the monkey problem:
   increased rates of local contact between farmers and monkeys on farms,
   contestations over the future of St. Kitts' land, and global debates
   over appropriate strategies to manage the monkey population. I show that
   although the monkey problem in St. Kitts does not involve an endangered
   or threatened species, my analysis of this construct has implications
   for primate populations that are threatened. This is because the root
   cause of this problemthe globalized discourse of nature conservation
   overpowering and problematizing local views about people-animal
   interactionscharacterizes so many of the locales home to primates of
   conservation concern.

AB Purpose Dependence on foreign energy supplies has resulted in some
   islands successfully harnessing alternative and renewable energy (RE)
   sources in order to provide a small degree of self-sufficiency. However,
   the development of Trinidad and Tobago (T&T)'s RE industry has
   stagnated, largely due to the existence of substantial energy subsidies,
   which present cheap fuel and electricity prices thus providing a
   disincentive to RE investment. This paper seeks to re-enforce the
   necessity for an indissoluble government intervention in the
   establishment of well-designed, coordinated and innovative
   public-private partnerships for a successful RE industry in T&T.
   Methodology This paper is based on a review of relevant social and
   economic literary sources; the research topic has been meticulously
   investigated.
   Findings Initial outcomes indicate that the principal facilitators of RE
   proliferation in the Caribbean, and more so T&T, will require (i)
   gradual reduction of the energy subsidy; (ii) declining project costs
   via fiscal incentives and grant financing; (iii) expectation of
   beneficial rates of return on investment through the guarantee of
   optimal prices for renewable electricity or the revenue gained from the
   sale of carbon credits; and (iv) capacity building, institutional
   strengthening and implementation of appropriate legislative and
   regulatory instruments which provide open access to the national grid.
   Research limitations/implications With the exception of T&T, Caribbean
   nations are heavily dependent on oil and gas imports to meet their
   primary energy requirements. The investigation conducted has limited
   documentation on cases of a similar nature within the region. The
   outcome of the steps identified above are based on conjecture using
   information gained from international situations. Practical implications
   -The study helps clarify the crucial role of T&T's government in the
   successful development of our RE industry. Resources and earnings should
   be used to develop T&T's infant RE industry and hence reduce the carbon
   footprint of the nation.
   Originality/value Past attempts by the government to promote RE and EE
   (energy efficiency) in T&T have been passive and prevaricated. In
   addition to outlining the existing fiscal initiatives available to the
   population, this paper provides short, medium and long term
   recommendations for the sustainability of RE in T&T. While subsidy
   reform, among others, poses a challenge it is nonetheless imperative if
   T&T is to move forward. With our abundance of solar, wind and
   waste-to-energy resources, there is great potential for a successful RE
   industry in T&T. More than just policy will be required to drive change;
   greater commitment by the government to ensure the sustainability and
   economic viability of T&T is required, while also attempting to alter
   the mindset of the citizenry to act as effective stewards of the
   island's resources for the wellbeing of future generations.

AB The sixgill sharks of the genus Hexanchus (Hexanchiformes, Hexanchidae)
   are large, rarely encountered deep-sea sharks, thought to comprise just
   two species: the bluntnose sixgill Hexanchus griseus (Bonaterre, 1788)
   and the bigeye sixgill Hexanchus nakamurai (Teng, 1962). Their
   distribution is putatively worldwide in tropical and temperate waters,
   but many verified records for these species are lacking, and
   misidentification is common. Taxonomic uncertainty has long surrounded
   H. nakamurai in particular, with debate as to whether individuals from
   the Atlantic constitute a separate species. Using 1,310 base pairs of
   two mitochondrial genes, COI and ND2, we confirm that bigeye sixgill
   sharks from the Atlantic Ocean (Belize, Gulf of Mexico, and Bahamas)
   diverge from those in the Pacific and Indian Oceans (Japan, La Reunion,
   and Madagascar) with 7.037% sequence divergence. This difference is
   similar to the genetic distance between both Atlantic and Indo-Pacific
   bigeye sixgill sharks and the bluntnose sixgill shark (7.965% and
   8.200%, respectively), and between the entire genus Hexanchus and its
   sister genus Heptranchias (8.308%). Such variation far exceeds previous
   measures of species-level genetic divergence in elasmobranchs, even
   among slowly-evolving deep-water taxa. Given the high degree of
   morphological similarity within Hexanchus, and the fact that cryptic
   diversity is common even among frequently observed shark species, we
   conclude that these results support the resurrection of the name
   Hexanchus vitulus Springer and Waller, 1969 for bigeye sixgill sharks in
   the northwest Atlantic Ocean. We propose the common name Atlantic
   sixgill shark for H. vitulus, and provide new locality records from
   Belize, as well as comments on its overall distribution.

AB The volcanic Sulphur Springs, St. Lucia, present an extreme environment
   due to high temperatures, low pH values, and high concentrations of
   sulfate and boron. St. Lucia offers some unique geochemical
   characteristics that may shape the microbial communities within the
   Sulphur Springs area. We chose six pools representing a range of
   geochemical characteristics for detailed microbial community analyses.
   Chemical concentrations varied greatly between sites. Microbial
   diversity was analyzed using 16S rRNA gene clone library analyses. With
   the exception of one pool with relatively low concentrations of
   dissolved ions, microbial diversity was very low, with Aquificales
   sequences dominating bacterial communities at most pools. The archaeal
   component of all pools was almost exclusively Acidianus spp. and did not
   vary between sites with different chemical characteristics. In the pool
   with the highest boron and sulfate concentrations, only archaeal
   sequences were detected. Compared with other sulfur springs such as
   those at Yellowstone, the microbial diversity at St. Lucia is very
   different, but it is similar to that at the nearby Lesser Antilles
   island of Montserrat. While high elemental concentrations seem to be
   related to differences in bacterial diversity here, similarities with
   other Lesser Antilles sites suggest that there may be a biogeographical
   component as well.

AB Quantitative analyses of nannofossil assemblages from two ODP sites were
   performed to determine changes in the surface water structure in the
   Caribbean Sea and implications for climatic changes during the late
   Pliocene. Analysis was made by calculation of accumulation rates and
   division of nannofossils into ecological groups based on their depth
   distributions and trophic regime (oligotrophic vs eutrophic). Between
   3.5 and 2.7 Ma, separate surface water masses existed in the northern
   and southern Caribbean. The northern surface water was strongly
   oligotrophic, with a deep thermocline/nutricline. Prior to 3.1 Ma, the
   southern Caribbean was characterized by a shallower
   thermocline/nutricline with minor upwelling induced by the presence of
   the past ITCZ (Intertropical Convergence Zone). After 3.1 Ma, the
   thermocline/nutricline deepened in the southern Caribbean and the upper
   water became oligotrophic as a result of the completion of the closure
   of the Isthmus. After an episodic invasion of cooler surface waters
   associated with high-latitude cooling at approximately 2.7 Ma, coccolith
   productivity in the Caribbean was at its lowest. A deep thermocline
   existed between 2.7 and 2.4 Ma and nutrient-depleted waters spread on
   the SUW (Subtropical Under Water) in the Caribbean.
   After 2.4 Ma, the increase of terrigenous materials from the South
   American continent caused an abundance of eutrophic taxa. This suggests
   that recent climate systems were established due to the intensification
   of the northern hemisphere glaciation. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

   revealed relationships between fish and coral species at each reef.
   Reefs with the greatest coral cover had the highest abundance and

AB Objective: The objective of the present study was to determine the
   knowledge and practices among Trinidad and Tobago school-attending
   adolescents towards energy drinks (ED), alcohol combined with energy
   drinks (AwED), weight-altering supplements (WAS) and vitamin/mineral
   supplements (VMS) and their experience of adverse effects associated
   with such use.
   Design: A cross-sectional, proportionate, stratified sampling strategy
   was adopted using a self-administered, de novo questionnaire. Setting:
   Secondary schools throughout Trinidad and Tobago.
   Subjects: Students aged 15-19 years.
   Results: Five hundred and sixty-one students participated, an 84%
   response rate; 43.0% were male, 40.5% East Indian and 34.1% mixed race.
   VMS, ED, WAS and anabolic steroids were used by 52.4%, 44.0%, 8.9% and
   1.4% of students, respectively, with 51.6% of ED users using AwED.
   Predictors of use of AwED were males and students who played sport for
   their school (OR = 1.9; 95% CI 1.2, 3.2 and OR = 2.6; 95% CI 1.4, 4.7,
   respectively). Predictors of ED use were males and attendees of
   government secondary schools (OR = 1.7; 95% CI 1.1, 2.4 and OR = 1.7;
   95% CI 1.2, 2.4, respectively). Side-effects, mainly palpitations,
   headaches and sleep disturbances, were reported in 20.7% of dietary
   supplement users.
   Conclusions: Many adolescent students in Trinidad and Tobago use dietary
   supplements, including ED and AwED, and about one-fifth of users
   experience side-effects. Identification of students at risk for ED, AwED
   and WAS use and education of students about the dangers of using dietary
   supplements need to be instituted to prevent potential adverse events.

AB Previous studies in Fiji have shown that females of the amphibious
   sea-krait Laticauda colubrina are much larger than males, and have
   larger heads relative to body size. The dimorphism has been interpreted
   in terms of adaptation to a sex divergence in prey-size: females
   primarily eat large (conger) eels rather than smaller (moray) eels. The
   hypothesis that dimorphism is affected by niche divergence predicts that
   the degree of sex dimorphism will shift when such a species invades a
   habitat with a different range of potential prey sizes. On the island of
   Efate in Vanuatu, L. colubrina and a regionally endemic sibling species
   (L. frontalis) both consume smaller eels (in absolute terms, and
   relative to the snake's body size) than do the previously-studied Fijian
   snakes. Patterns of morphology and sexual dimorphism have shifted also.
   Both Vanuatu taxa are slender-bodied, and frontalis is smaller and less
   dimorphic than L. colubrina. Females grow larger than males in all taxa,
   and have larger heads (relative to body length), but the degree of
   sexual divergence is lower in Vanuatu (especially in frontalis). Dietary
   overlap (in prey species as well as size) is high between adult
   frontalis and juvenile colubrina, but the two taxa differ in prey
   size/predator size relationships. In particular, male frontalis eat very
   small prey and have very short heads. Our results are consistent with
   the hypothesis that sex differences in the mean adult body sizes and
   relative head sizes of laticaudine snakes are linked to sex differences
   in feeding biology.

AB The dolphinfish, Coryphaena hippurus, is an oceanic epipelagic fish with
   economic importance to sport and commercial fisheries throughout its
   worldwide distribution in tropical and sub-tropical waters. In the
   eastern Caribbean, dolphinfish are generally piscivorous, eating a wide
   variety of fish species including small oceanic pelagic species (e.g.
   flyingfish, halfbeaks, man-o-war fish, sargassum and rough triggerfish),
   juveniles of large oceanic pelagic species (e.g. tunas, billfish, jacks,
   dolphinfish), and pelagic larvae of neritic, benthic species (e.g.
   flying gurnards, triggerfish, pufferfish, grunts). They also eat
   invertebrates (e.g. cephalopods, mysids, scyphozoans), suggesting that
   they are essentially non-selective foragers. This appears to be typical
   of dolphinfish from other locations and of tropical oceanic pelagic
   species in general. Post-larval flying gurnards and flyingfish rank as
   the most important prey species overall. However, the diet varies with
   season, and mysids are a very important component from October to
   December. Diet also varies slightly with predator size (small
   dolphinfish eat fewer flyingfish and more squid than larger sized
   dolphinfish), and with sex (males take proportionally more of the
   active, fast swimming species such as flyingfish, squid and dolphinfish
   than do females). From these results and a review of the literature to
   determine the diet of other tropical oceanic species and the predators
   of dolphinfish, it can be seen that predator-prey relationships and
   interspecies competition for food clearly involve other commercially
   important species. As such, interactions between the surface trolling
   dolphinfish fisheries, the surface gillnet flyingfish fisheries, and the
   subsurface longline tuna fisheries in the eastern Caribbean can be
   expected.

AB Despite fly-fishing's growing popularity, there are few studies on its
   environmental and social impacts. The present study is the first
   large-scale investigation of the fly-fishing lodge sector and its
   sustainability practices. A sampling frame of global fly-fishing lodges
   was created by including lodges featured by several major fly-fishing
   outfitters, fly-fishing travel companies, and publications. A sample of
   196 lodges was drawn and their websites analyzed with respect to
   sustainability communications. The analysis indicated that although the
   web presence of fly-fishing lodges is high (only 16.3% of the sample did
   not have a website), reporting on sustainability initiatives is low. The
   most popular initiatives included catch and release practices, renewable
   energy use, restoration of habitats, support for local community, and
   growing organic food. While many lodges explicitly promoted access to
   remote areas, they rarely addressed their own impacts and sustainability
   performance.

   PCR detection of Bifidobacteria adolescentis and human or bovine
   specific Bacteroidales were used to examine potential sources. Seven of
   14 sites in Trinidad including Maracas Bay which is a major public beach
   contained significant fecal contamination based on enterococci numbers
   counts exceeding established thresholds for areas of direct contact.
   Forty six percent of the 27 stations in Puerto Rico were over the
   established thresholds for enterococci and 49% according to E. coli
   counts. About 31% of the stations examined in Puerto Rico had evidence
   of human derived fecal contamination. Human fecal pollution was detected
   in only one station from Trinidad. Bovine derived contamination was

AB In the Colombian Caribbean Sea a shallow water commercial shrimp fishery
   has been developed, targeting mainly Farfantepenaeus notialis. Yet,
   similarly to so many fisheries around the world, the exploitation of
   this shrimp is not regulated, and a significant depletion has resulted.
   This study investigates new fishing areas, exploring the poorly
   understood deep-sea habitats in the Colombian Caribbean Sea, to
   determine the potential for a viable deep shrimp fishery, studying their
   abundance and spatial distribution. We found high abundances for giant
   red shrimp (Aristaeomorpha foliacea) and royal red shrimp (Pleoticus
   robustus), both important commercially. The higher biomass of these two
   deep-sea shrimp species were found mainly in the northern zone of the
   Colombian Caribbean Sea, where the local oceanography is modulated by
   the seasonal upwelling with high productivity. The size-structure
   following depth strata showed that A. foliacea increase in size with the
   depth and the contrary for P. robustus. The majority of adult
   individuals in these two deep-sea shrimp species reflect the non-fished
   populations in the study area. However, more scientific assessment is
   necessary to determine life cycle population parameters of deep-sea
   shrimps and associated biodiversity before initiating a new commercial
   shrimp fishery.

AB Objective: Childhood obesity is increasingly being recognized as a major
   public health problem in the Caribbean. The objective of the present
   study was to evaluate the effectiveness of a short-term, school-based,
   multi-component education intervention on improving the knowledge,
   attitudes and behaviour of primary-school children towards better
   dietary and activity habits.
   Design: The study was a randomized, controlled, school-based nutrition
   education and physical activity intervention. Participating schools were
   randomly assigned to the intervention (IVG) and non-intervention (NIVG)
   groups.
   Setting: All primary schools in Sangre Grande, north-east Trinidad.
   Subjects: Five hundred and seventy-nine pupils in their sixth year of
   primary-school education were enrolled from twelve schools in Sangre
   Grande, north-east Trinidad.
   Results: Approximately 23% of participants had BMI >= 85th percentile of
   the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention age- and gender-specific
   cut-off values. In multivariate regression equations controlling for
   age, gender, BMI and baseline value, intervention was associated with
   lower intake levels of fried foods, snack foods high in fat, sugar and
   salt (HESS) and sodas (P<0.05). In similar analyses, intervention was
   associated with higher knowledge scores (P<0.01). Intervention was not
   significantly associated with physical activity and Children's Eating
   Attitude Test-26 (ChEAT26) scores after controlling for age, gender, BMI
   and the relevant baseline values.
   Conclusions: The intervention was associated with lower intake levels of
   fried foods, HFSS foods, sodas and higher knowledge scores independent
   of age, gender, BMI, ethnicity and the appropriate baseline value.
   Finally, the intervention was not associated with changes in physical
   activity behaviours in multivariate analyses.

AB Increasing development in tropical regions provides new economic
   opportunities that can improve livelihoods, but it threatens the
   functional integrity and ecosystem services provided by terrestrial and
   aquatic ecosystems when conducted unsustainably. Given the small size of
   many islands, communities may have limited opportunities to replace loss
   and damage to the natural resources upon which they depend for ecosystem
   service provisioning, thus heightening the need for proactive,
   integrated management. This study quantifies the effectiveness of
   management strategies, stipulated in logging codes-of-practice, at
   minimizing soil erosion and sediment runoff as clearing extent
   increases, using Kolombangara Island, Solomon Islands as a case study.
   Further, we examine the ability of erosion reduction strategies to
   maintain sustainable soil erosion rates and reduce potential downstream
   impacts to drinking water and environmental water quality. We found that
   increasing land clearing-even with best management strategies in
   place-led to unsustainable levels of soil erosion and significant
   impacts to downstream water quality, compromising the integrity of the
   land for future agricultural uses, consistent access to clean drinking
   water, and important downstream ecosystems. Our results demonstrate that
   in order to facilitate sustainable development, logging codes of
   practice must explicitly link their soil erosion reduction strategies to
   soil erosion and downstream water quality thresholds, otherwise they
   will be ineffective at minimizing the impacts of logging activities. The
   approach taken here to explicitly examine soil erosion rates and
   downstream water quality in relation to best management practices and
   increasing land clearing should be applied more broadly across a range
   of ecosystems to inform decision-making about the socioeconomic and
   environmental trade-offs associated with logging, and other types of
   land use change.

AB Using a novel observationally constrained Lagrangian iron model forced
   by outputs from an eddy-resolving biogeochemical ocean model, we examine
   the sensitivity of the Equatorial Undercurrent (EUC) iron distribution
   to EUC source region iron concentrations. We find that elevated iron
   concentrations derived from New Guinea Coastal Undercurrent (NGCU) alone
   is insufficient to explain the high concentrations observed in the EUC.
   In addition, due to the spread in transit times, interannual NGCU iron
   pulses are scavenged, diluted, or eroded, before reaching the eastern
   equatorial Pacific. With an additional iron source from the nearby New
   Ireland Coastal Undercurrent, EUC iron concentrations become consistent
   with observations. Furthermore, as both the New Guinea and New Ireland
   Coastal Undercurrents strengthen during El Nino, increased iron input
   into the EUC can enhance the iron supply into the eastern equatorial
   Pacific. Notably, during the 1997/1998 El Nino, this causes a simulated
   30% iron increase at a 13 month lag.

AB Marine protected areas (MPAs) have been widely adopted as the leading
   tool for coral-reef conservation, but resource users seldom accept them
   [1, 2], and many have failed to produce tangible conservation benefits
   [3]. Few studies have objectively and simultaneously examined the types
   of MPAs that are most effective in conserving reef resources and the
   socioeconomic factors responsible for effective conservation [4-6]. We
   simultaneously explored measures of reef and socioeconomic conservation
   success at four national parks, four comanaged reserves, and three
   traditionally managed areas in Indonesia and Papua New Guinea.
   Underwater visual censuses of key ecological indicators [7, 8] revealed
   that the average size and biomass of fishes were higher in all areas
   under traditional management and at one comanaged reserve when compared
   to nearby unmanaged areas. Socioeconomic assessments [6, 9, 10] revealed
   that this "effective conservation" was positively related to compliance,
   visibility of the reserve, and length of time the management had been in
   place but negatively related to market integration, wealth, and village
   population size. We suggest that in cases where the resources for
   enforcement are lacking, management regimes that are designed to meet
   community goals can achieve greater compliance and subsequent
   conservation success than regimes designed primarily for biodiversity
   conservation.

AB Global warming is seen as one of the greatest threats to the world's
   coral reefs and, with the continued rise in sea surface temperature
   predicted into the future, there is a great need for further
   understanding of how to prevent and address the damaging impacts. This
   is particularly so for countries whose economies depend heavily on
   healthy reefs, such as those of the eastern Caribbean. Here, we compare
   the severity of bleaching and mortality for five dominant coral species
   at six representative reef sites in Barbados during the two most
   significant warm-water events ever recorded in the eastern Caribbean,
   i.e., 2005 and 2010, and describe prevailing island-scale sea water
   conditions during both events. In so doing, we demonstrate that coral
   bleaching and subsequent mortality were considerably lower in 2010 than
   in 2005 for all species, irrespective of site, even though the
   anomalously warm water temperature profiles were very similar between
   years. We also show that during the 2010 event, Barbados was engulfed by
   a transient dark green turbid water mass of riverine origin coming from
   South America, We suggest that reduced exposure to high solar radiation
   associated with this transient water mass was the primary contributing
   factor to the lower bleaching and mortality observed in all corals. We
   conclude that monitoring these episodic mesoscale oceanographic features
   might improve risk assessments of southeastern Caribbean reefs to
   warm-water events in the future.

AB We analyzed the avifaunas of the Caribbean islands and nearby

   concordance with geological and phylogenetic evidence. Using
   distributional information of birds obtained from published literature,
   a presence/absence matrix for 695 genera and 2026 species of land and
   freshwater birds was constructed and analyzed. Three different analyses
   were performed: for species, for genera, and for species and genera
   combined. In the combined analysis, the Lesser Antilles appear
   paraphyletic at the base of the cladogram. Then, two major clades are
   identified: South America (Andes, Venezuelan lowlands, Dutch West Indies
   and Trinidad and Tobago) and North America, including the Greater
   Antilles in a clade that is the sister area to Yucatan and the Central
   American countries nested from north to south. PAE results support
   Caribbean vicariant models and cladistic biogeographical hypotheses on
   area relationships, and show relative congruence with available
   phylogenetic data. Bird biogeography on the Caribbean islands appears to
   have been caused by both vicariance and dispersal processes. (c) The

AB Regular sea urchins are an important component of the rich and diverse
   echinoid fauna of the Lower Pliocene Kairuku Formation, Yule Island,
   Papua New Guinea. Seven taxa are recognised; including the cidaroids
   Phyllacanthus imperialis var. javana K. Martin, 1885, Phyllacanthus sp.
   and Prionocidaris verticillata (Lamarck, 1816), the toxopneustids
   Cyrtechinus verruculatus (Lutken) and Schizechinus cf. tuberculatus
   (Pomel), a temnopleurid Temnotrema macleayana (Tenison-Woods) and a
   parasaleniid Parasalenia poehli Pfeffer, 1887. The cidaroids,
   parasaleniid and temnopleurid occupied shallow-water reef habitats. The
   toxopneustids were dominant herbivores in adjacent seagrass meadows. The
   strong affinities evident between the seagrass meadow- and shallow-water
   sand-dwelling echinoid faunas of Yule Island and fossil and extant
   faunas of the Red Sea region, parallel the geographic patterns of
   species diversity of Indo-Pacific seagrasses, corals and mangroves.

AB Timor-Leste is among the world's youngest and poorest countries. It
   suffers from seasonal food insecurity and has the third-highest stunting
   rate globally. Previously inadequately documented, this paper summarises
   recent advances in understanding household food security in Timor-Leste
   and the multifaceted approaches being used to overcome it. Information
   comes from the extensive annual surveys of the Seeds of Life (SoL)
   program in Timor-Leste. The hungry season prior to maize and rice
   harvests is the key issue in household food security in Timor-Leste.
   Farm households cope with the problem through crop diversification with
   tubers playing a lead role as grain stocks dwindle. Foraging for wild
   food resources, selling animals and other assets, and social networks
   are other coping strategies. To address seasonal food insecurity, the
   government has focused on rice importation and the improvement of
   agricultural productivity within a multi-dimensional program.
   Information on storage by households of the key staple, maize, indicates
   an improving trend in food security at the household level from
   2006/2007 to 2010/2011 through a significant reduction in the percentage
   of 'at risk' households-those who grow insufficient maize for storage
   during the year. The current emphasis on the widespread dissemination of
   the new high-yielding SoL cultivars has the potential to augment these
   improving trends. Nevertheless this picture remains vulnerable to
   weather shocks-such as drought-which are anticipated to increase with
   climate change and it is important to build further resilience into the
   agricultural systems of Timor-Leste.

AB Colombia is recognized as a megadiverse country on the basis of the
   number of terrestrial animal and plant species occurring within its
   boundaries. However, due to the circumstance that it possesses coasts on
   both the Caribbean Sea and the Pacific Ocean, each of them exhibiting
   distinct geological, oceanographic, and climatic features, Colombia is
   perhaps the country with the highest marine biological diversity in
   South America and one of the most biodiverse in the New World. Although
   scientific research concerning marine biodiversity of Colombia has a
   very short history, considerable knowledge has been achieved in the last
   10 years, particularly in regard to species inventories and ecosystem
   characterizations, including thematic mapping. Relatively accurate
   estimates about the numbers of species of fishes, birds, mammals,
   reptiles, and some marine invertebrate groups occurring in Colombian
   waters are now available, as well as the location, extent, and structure
   of the major coastal-marine ecosystems, including coral reefs,
   mangroves, and seagrass meadows. According to their geologic,
   hydrographic, climatic, and biological features, the coastal and oceanic
   realms of Colombia have been subdivided into 18 natural ecoregions, nine
   in the Caribbean and nine in the Pacific. Considering the current
   scientific capacity of Colombia, including financial and logistic
   limitations, short and mid-term research plans and programs have been
   designed in order to orient marine biodiversity studies toward
   prioritary issues and geographic areas according to the responsibilities
   imposed by the Biodiversity Convention and the National Biodiversity
   Plan.

   are characterised by their velvety dorsal and ventral surfaces, covered
   with fine denticles. Although similar in shape, they differ by their
   colour pattern, dermal armature, development of the lateral tail folds,
   and size of the pelvic-fin anterior lobe and nasal curtain. The
   description of the fourth species, Notoraja inusitata n. sp., is based
   on a juvenile male exhibiting some unusual features resembling those of

AB This study documents impacts of the small Indian mongoose (Herpestes
   auropunctatus) on a threatened endemic fauna occurring in a biodiversity
   hotspot within a hotspot, the Hellshire Hills, Jamaica. We analyzed the
   stomach contents of 217 mongooses and supplemented this information with
   behavioural observations. The mongoose's diet consists primarily of
   invertebrates and lizards, but bird feathers, mammal hair, and a small
   number of seeds were also recorded. Invertebrates and lizards accounted
   for 93% of identified prey items. Of special concern were the remains of
   threatened species such as the recently re-discovered blue-tailed
   galliwasp (Celestus duquesneyi), indicating that the mongoose may
   represent a considerable threat to this poorly known taxon. Dietary
   analyses did not reveal remains of the Critically Endangered Jamaican
   iguana (Cyclura collei), yet field observations confirmed that the
   mongoose is a potent predator of hatchling iguanas. Ignoring issues of
   sample size, this suggests that the analysis of stomach contents alone
   may mask important demographic impacts attributable to the mongoose (or
   other predator species). In other words, rare and endangered species may
   not be detected in diet samples, but the impact of predation may be of
   demographic significance for effected prey taxa. This study supports
   previous arguments concerning the negative impact of the mongoose on
   endemic insular species, and underscores the utility of employing field
   observations of mongoose foraging behaviour to provide important
   insights into the conservation implications of predation by non-native
   predators.

AB Economic ideas of social capital often narrow the social domain to
   transactions based on individualised motivations (i.e., profit) leaving
   out more social possibilities which may or may not involve maximising
   personal consumption (i.e., fights for 'social justice,' nationalism).
   This narrowing of vision has real-life consequences, implicated not only
   in dominant economic theory, but also in socio-economic policies for
   'development.' In order to tackle challenges to local and regional food
   security in the Caribbean, we must open policy-making to more
   encompassing (Dumont, 1966) motivations for economic behaviour linked to
   the creation of social identities within and between people. As a step
   towards this end, the author incorporates Sen's concept of commitment
   and related theories of identity formation into analyses of food
   production in the Caribbean, and Cuba in particular.

AB Trinidad and Tobago is a twin island state situated in the Southern
   Caribbean where there is a strong tradition of research in all aspects
   of Marine and Aquatic Sciences. Much of this research in recent times
   has focused on different aspects of pollution and environmental
   degradation of offshore and inland waters because of the importance of
   the petroleum industries and agriculture. There has also been a lot of
   research on fish stocks, commercial species and aquaculture. The three
   main Institutions responsible for this research are The University of
   the West Indies, the Institute of Marine Affairs and the Fisheries
   Division of the Ministry of Food Production and Marine Resources.
   This paper discusses the information resources available to researchers
   in this area, from the largely print based sources in the past to the
   more recent digital and online resources now being provided by the
   libraries and information centres of these organisations. Some of the
   initiatives in and challenges of acquiring and providing electronic
   information are outlined.

AB The Atlantic warm pool (AWP) of water warmer than 28.5 degrees C
   comprises the Gulf of Mexico, the Caribbean Sea, and the western
   tropical North Atlantic (TNA). The AWP reaches its maximum size around
   September, with large AWPs being almost 3 times larger than small ones.
   Although ENSO teleconnections are influential on the AWP, about
   two-thirds of the large and small AWP variability appears unrelated to
   ENSO. The AWP is usually geographically different from the TNA; however,
   the AWP size is correlated with the TNA SST anomalies. During August to
   October, large AWPs and warm TNA are associated with increased rainfall
   over the Caribbean, Mexico, the eastern subtropical Atlantic, and the
   southeast Pacific, and decreased rainfall in the northwest United
   States, Great Plains, and eastern South America. In particular, rainfall
   in the Caribbean, Central America, and eastern South America from August
   to October is mainly related to the size of the AWP. Large (small) AWPs
   and warm (cold) TNA correspond to a weakening (strengthening) of the
   northward surface winds from the AWP to the Great Plains that disfavors
   (favors) moisture transport for rainfall over the Great Plains. On the
   other hand, large (small) AWPs and warm (cold) TNA strengthen (weaken)
   the summer regional Atlantic Hadley circulation that emanates from the
   warm pool region into the southeast Pacific, changing the subsidence
   over the southeast Pacific and thus the stratus cloud and drizzle there.
   The large AWP, associated with a decrease in sea level pressure and an
   increase in atmospheric convection and cloudiness, corresponds to a weak
   tropospheric vertical wind shear and a deep warm upper ocean, and thus
   increases Atlantic hurricane activity.

AB We examined the utility of otolith minor and trace element chemistry,

   means of delineating population structure in the Nassau grouper
   (Epinephelus striatus). We characterized the elemental composition of
   otoliths collected in 1993 from three locations in Exuma Sound, Bahamas
   and from Glover Reef, Belize in 1995. A single location in Exuma Sound
   was sampled in 1994 to test temporal variability in otolith composition.
   Five elements (Ca, Zn, Sr, Ba and Pb) were routinely detected, at levels
   significantly above background, by solution-based ICP-MS. Results from
   analysis of variance of elemental data, expressed as a ratio to Ca,
   indicated that there were no significant differences among the Exuma
   locations for any element, but significant variability was found between
   Clover Reef and the pooled Exuma localities for Zn/Ca, Sr/Ca and Ba/Ca
   ratios. Significant inter-annual differences at one Exuma Sound location
   was restricted to Ba/Ca ratios. Discriminant function analysis correctly
   classified 86% and 95% of the Belize and pooled Exuma sites,
   respectively. Otoliths from Belize were characterized by low Zn/Ca and
   high Ba/Ca and Pb/Ca ratios compared to otoliths from fish collected in
   Exuma Sound. Although differences in Ba levels may be related to
   upwelling at clover Reef, more data are needed to definitely link
   otolith composition with regional differences in water chemistry.

AB Introduced marine species can have a large impact upon small countries
   that are reliant on marine tourism. Non-governmental organisations, such
   as the World Conservation Union (IUCN), are working with technical
   experts to implement capacity building and awareness programs that
   transfers introduced marine species knowledge to countries in need of
   aid. The Republic of Palau is reliant on tourism and as such is
   proactively engaging in this process to ensure that it has the necessary
   skills to determine and manage its introduced marine species pathways
   and vectors. The IUCN with the aid of technical experts implemented a
   four day training workshop that provided both theoretical and practical
   field experience with introduced marine species port surveys. An outcome
   of this exercise was the detection of 11 introduced marine species, the
   training of 10 Palau agencies and two international organisations, and
   recommendations for future implementation that will aid Palau to address
   the problem of introduced marine species within their borders.

AB The use of marine protected area (MPA) networks to sustain fisheries and
   conserve biodiversity is predicated on two critical yet rarely tested
   assumptions. Individual MPAs must produce sufficient larvae that settle
   within that reserve's boundaries to maintain local populations while
   simultaneously supplying larvae to other MPA nodes in the network that
   might otherwise suffer local extinction. Here, we use genetic parentage
   analysis to demonstrate that patterns of self-recruitment of two reef
   fishes (Amphiprion percula and Chaetodon vagabundus) in an MPA in Kimbe
   Bay, Papua New Guinea, were remarkably consistent over several years.
   However, dispersal from this reserve to two other nodes in an MPA
   network varied between species and through time. The stability of our
   estimates of self-recruitment suggests that even small MPAs may be
   self-sustaining. However, our results caution against applying
   optimization strategies to MPA network design without accounting for
   variable connectivity among species and over time.

AB Effective fisheries management requires a detailed understanding of the
   life history strategies of managed species. The Queen Triggerfish
   Balistes vetula supports productive fisheries in the western Atlantic,
   including the U.S. Caribbean. We utilized a combination of
   fishery-dependent and fishery-independent samples to assess the size
   structure, sex ratio, size at maturity, spawning season, and spawning
   frequency for a Queen Triggerfish population in the U.S. Caribbean. From
   2013 to 2018, 1,148 samples were collected, ranging in size from 67 to
   434 mm FL. This study provides important life history information from
   an exploited population and is the first to describe Queen Triggerfish
   reproductive biology in detail for the Caribbean. We documented that the
   Queen Triggerfish is a sexually dimorphic species characterized by a
   medium size at maturity. The smallest sexually mature male and female
   were 184 and 215 mm FL, respectively. Lengths at 50% sexual maturity
   (L-50) for males sampled from Puerto Rico and St. Croix, U.S. Virgin
   Islands, were similar (206 and 211 mm FL, respectively) and were
   significantly smaller than the L-50 values for females (Puerto Rico: 256
   mm FL; St. Croix: 245 mm FL). Queen Triggerfish, nesting benthic
   spawners, exhibited group-synchronous oogenesis and indeterminate
   fecundity over the spawning season that started as early as the week
   after the full moon in December and extended until August. Spawning
   interval, defined as the number of days between spawning events in a
   female, was 54-55 d, indicating that a female could spawn up to five
   times over the estimated 241-267-d spawning season. As regulations on
   grouper and snapper species in the Caribbean increase, Queen Triggerfish
   will experience increasing fishing pressure. Managers should continue to
   evaluate potential impacts of this pressure and establish management
   regulations that consider the region-specific reproductive season and
   size at maturity.

   Philippines, Indonesia, Malaysia, Sri Lanka and Vanuatu. In Malaysia,
   Lignosus rhinocerus is the most sought after medicinal mushroom by Semai

   used traditionally to treat various diseases such as asthma, breast
   cancer, cough, fever and food poisoning. Current results indicated
   polysaccharide from sclerotia of indigenous L. rhinocerus extracted
   through hot water is able to inhibit up to 45% growth of human lung
   carcinoma. Inhibition is achieved when concentration of polysaccharide
   are in the range of 4-8 mu g/ml. Present preliminary study suggests
   beta-glucan-rich polysaccharide from sclerotia of indigenous L.
   rhinocerus has anti-proliferation activity on human lung carcinoma

AB Freshwater ostracodes from the Neotropical-Caribbean region are
   potentially excellent tools for evolutionary and paleoenvironmental
   studies but their use is limited, because integrated data in taxonomy,
   environmental, and geographical preferences of the species at large
   scale remain unknown. A total of 118 species were recorded in the
   Neotropical-Caribbean region based on existing literature and results
   from fieldwork. About 74% of the species are restricted to the region
   and most of them show limited distributional areas as a consequence of
   environmental heterogeneity. Based on Parsimony Analysis of Endemicity,
   five areas of endemism were identified: (1) southern Florida, (2)
   southern Mexico-northern Central America, (3) Cuba, (4) Lesser Antilles,
   and (5) northern Venezuela-Aruba-Curacao-Trinidad. The conservation
   status of these areas was revised and lake ecosystems with endemic taxa
   were proposed to be included in environmental protection initiatives.
   Biogeographical analysis showed a strong differentiation between the
   ostracode faunas of the Neotropical-Caribbean region and the
   Neotropical-Neogen region. Few exchanges of species were attributed to
   ecological and geographical barriers such as volcanism and irregular
   orography. Faunal affinities within the Neotropical-Caribbean region
   indicated closer relationship between southern Mexico, southern Florida
   and the Antilles suggesting a common biogeographical history. Middle
   Central America and Chiapas-Guatemala highlands were discriminated as
   isolated regions.

AB Density-dependent changes in predator foraging behavior due to
   intraspecific competition for food can have important implications for
   population dynamics of both the predator and its prey. The Indo-Pacific
   red lionfish Pterois volitans is an invasive predatory reef fish that
   has reached high population densities and can cause large reductions in
   small native fishes. To determine whether lionfish behavior or movement
   varies with local lionfish and/or prey densities, I conducted
   observations of lionfish on 16 coral patch reefs in The Bahamas.
   Lionfish foraging activity and movement varied significantly with
   lionfish density. At higher densities, lionfish exhibited greater
   activity levels, time away from shelter, and more short-term foraging
   movements between coral patch reefs and surrounding seagrass habitats.
   However, these changes were not uniform throughout the day, with
   differences in activity occurring only at dusk and differences in
   movement occurring at both dawn and dusk, but not midday. Although some
   lionfish foraging behaviors varied with prey density, overall lionfish
   density was more strongly related to differences in lionfish activity
   patterns. These temporal and spatial changes in lionfish foraging
   behaviors are consistent with the predicted effects of intraspecific
   competition and may have important consequences for lionfish removal
   efforts and native prey populations. Specifically, in areas with higher
   lionfish densities, prey fishes that are more active at dusk and/or
   inhabit seagrass beds near coral patch reefs may be more vulnerable to
   lionfish predation. By culling lionfish, managers may reduce the local
   foraging movements of lionfish and thus help maintain native fish
   communities in multiple habitats.

AB Papua New Guinea has astonishing biological and cultural diversity
   which, coupled with a strong community reliance on the land and its
   biota for subsistence, add complexity to monitoring and conservation and
   in particular, the demonstration of declines in wildlife populations.
   Many species of concern are long-lived which provides additional
   challenges for conservation. We provide, for the first time, concrete
   evidence of a substantive decline in populations of the pig-nosed turtle
   (Carettochelys insculpta): an important source of protein for local
   communities. Our study combined matched village and market surveys
   separated by 30 years, trends in nesting female size, and assessment of
   levels and efficacy of harvest, each of which was an essential
   ingredient to making a definitive assessment of population trends.
   Opportunities for an effective response by local communities to these
   declines needs to consider both conservation and fisheries perspectives
   because local communities consider the turtle a food resource, whereas
   the broader global community views it as a high priority for
   conservation. Our study in the Kikori region is representative of
   harvest regimes in most rivers within the range of the species in Papua
   New Guinea, and provides lessons for conservation of many other wildlife
   species subject to harvest. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The use of environmental DNA (eDNA) to monitor rare and elusive species
   has great potential for conservation biology. Traditional surveying
   methods can be time-consuming, labourintensive, subject to error or can
   be invasive and potentially damaging to habitat. The Trinidad golden
   treefrog (Phytotriades auratus) is one such species that would benefit
   from such an approach. This species inhabits the giant bromeliad
   (Glomeropitcairnia erectiflora) on two peaks on the Caribbean island of
   Trinidad. Traditional survey methods for this species have required the
   destruction of the giant bromeliad, which is the only known habitat of
   this frog. Here we described the development of an eDNA PCR-based assay
   that uses water drawn from the water-filled phytotelmata of the giant
   bromeliad along with the use of a synthetic DNA positive control that
   can be easily amplified in the bacterium Escherichia coli. The assay can
   detect to a DNA concentration of 1.4ng. Sampling of 142 bromeliads using
   this method revealed 9% were positive for P. auratus DNA. These data
   suggest that eDNA methods also have great potential for revealing the
   presence of elusive species in arboreal habitats.

AB The Cs-137 method was employed to investigate the recent historical rate
   of sediment deposition on a lowland alluvial floodplain in the Falefa
   River basin, Upolu Island, Samoa. Caesium stratigraphy in the floodplain
   sediment profile was clearly defined, with a broad peak at 145-175 cm
   depth. The measured rate of vertical accretion over the last 40 years is
   4.0 +/- 0.4 crn per year. This rate exceeds observations in humid
   environments elsewhere, but is similar to that recorded on other
   tropical Pacific Islands. Available flow data for the Vaisigano River in
   Samoa give a 'near-catastrophic' index value of 0.6 for flood
   variability. This is associated with the occurrence of tropical cyclones
   and storms in the Samoa area. Large floods therefore probably contribute
   to the high rate of floodplain sedimentation on Upolu Island. A small

AB Population sizes of generalist consumers are increasing in many
   ecosystems because of various human activities, and it is critical to
   understand the trophic role of these generalist species if we are to
   predict how they may affect food web structure and ecosystem function.
   Lionfish Pterois volitans/miles have spread throughout the Western
   Atlantic and Gulf of Mexico and they may have significant effects on
   native faunal communities. We characterized the trophic ecology of
   lionfish in back reef habitats on Abaco Island, Bahamas, drawing on
   recently developed analytical tools that employ both direct diet
   information and stable isotope data. Although delta N-15 and delta C-13
   bi-plot data appeared to suggest substantial niche overlap with native
   gray snapper and schoolmaster snapper, Bayesian analytical tools
   suggested differences in core isotopic niches among the species. This
   was consistent with direct diet information, as lionfish fed almost
   exclusively on small prey fishes and snapper fed more commonly on
   crustaceans. When combining empirical isotope and diet data in a
   simulation model, individual lionfish appear to be more specialized in

   be driven by high site-fidelity of lionfish, in conjunction with

   considered to be generalist predators, and our data reveal aspects of
   this trophic generality that must be considered as the role of lionfish
   in their invaded habitats continues to be examined.

AB The aim of this study was to determine if marine species diversity was
   influenced by geographical location and whether it was higher at lower
   latitudes. Artificial collectors (made of nylon pan scourers) were
   employed as a standard substratum for the colonisation of marine
   invertebrates inhabiting subtidal (12 to 15 m) hard, rocky bottom
   substrata. These artificial substrate units (ASUs) were deployed at
   different latitudes including northern and southern temperate (South
   West England, UK and New Zealand), tropical (Trinidad and Tobago, West
   Indies) and polar (Signy Island, Antarctica) areas. The polychaetes,
   representative of the macrofauna and the nematodes, representative of
   the meiofauna fractions of the total invertebrate fauna collected were
   analysed.
   Neither polychaete nor nematode species diversity showed a trend based
   on latitude and each taxon showed a different pattern of diversity
   variation in relation to location. Polychaete diversity varied from area
   to area with highest species diversity occurring in the southern
   temperate (New Zealand). Nematode species diversity however was similar
   for the northern and southern temperate (UK and New Zealand) and the
   tropical area (Trinidad and Tobago). Thus, although the number of
   locations studied was limited, these data do not conform to a gradient
   in species diversity with latitude as has been previously supposed. The
   success of ASUs to compare species diversities in standardised habitat
   units augurs well for their future use in other ecological areas such as
   biogeographical or pollution studies. (C) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights

AB Coral reefs and associated depositional environments of the
   Caribbean-Atlantic region have characteristics that reflect control by
   physical processes, both oceanic and atmospheric. Wave direction and
   wave power help determine sites for productive reef development and
   shape reef morphology as well as community structure. Spur and groove
   orientations reflect changes in direction of waves as they refract
   across a reef-dominated shelf. Abrupt topography of reef-dominated shelf
   margins interacts with tidally modulated flows to create an energetic
   and productive deep reef environment which is buffered from the
   modifying effects of forceful wave action.
   Shallow wave-reef interactions involve dissipative effects of wave
   breaking, turbulence, and friction, resulting in measured wave energy
   transformations ranging from 72 to 97% depending on reef configuration
   and water depth. Dissipative processes produce strong reef-normal surge
   currents that transport sediment lagoonward, drive backreef lagoon
   circulation, and influence fluid flow and diagenesis within the reef.
   The intensity of these processes is modulated at the tidal frequency.
   Other long period waves (infragravity) are important agents of mass
   transport of water and fine sediment. Low speed, long duration currents
   forced by long waves are potentially important for transporting larvae
   as well as fine sediment out of a given reef-lagoon system.
   Ocean-scale currents impinging on steep island and continental margin
   topography may cause reef-limiting upwelling and nutrient loading. The
   Caribbean Current upwells on the Nicaragua shelf and carbonate platforms
   of the Nicaraguan Rise. High trophic resources favor algal rather than
   coral communities and large (20-30 m relief) Halimeda biotherms occupy
   niches normally reserved for coral reefs.
   Thermodynamic air-sea interactions (heat, moisture and momentum flux)
   regulate the physical properties of reef lagoon and bank top waters. In
   extra-tropical reef settings (e.g. Bermuda, Florida, Bahamas and Arabian
   Gulf) cold air outbreaks cause precipitous drops in bank water
   temperatures and significant increases in bank water salinity and
   suspended sediment load. Water temperatures are routinely forced below
   the limit for survival of reef corals and many species of calcareous
   green algae. Associated increases in the density of shallow waters
   produce a disequilibrium with surface waters of the adjacent ocean
   favoring shelf transport to deep water sites of reef development and
   beyond.

AB Since its introduction to the tropical western Atlantic in the 1980s,
   the Indo-Pacific lionfish, Pterois volitans, has become one of the most
   devastating species invasions in the marine environment. It remains
   unclear whether release from parasitism has played a role in its
   success. The capsalid monogenean Neobenedenia pargueraensis is a common
   Caribbean ectoparasite with a broad host range that, in high numbers,
   can kill hosts. However, previous research found that lionfish collected
   from the Bahamas, Puerto Rico and the US Virgin Islands were not
   parasitized by N. pargueraensis. Possible explanations for this are that
   1) lionfish do not occupy habitat where infective stages are present;
   and 2) lionfish are not susceptible to this parasite. The goal of this
   project was to determine the susceptibility of lionfish to N.
   pargueraensis. Experiments were conducted in spring and summer of 2012
   and 2013 on St. Thomas, US Virgin Islands. Lionfish (n = 24) and control
   blue tang, Acanthurus coeruleus (n = 19) were caught from nearby shallow
   reefs, treated to remove pre-existing ectoparasites, and exposed to high
   concentrations of N. pargueraensis for 14 days. Despite exposure to high
   concentrations of parasites, only one of 24 lionfish was parasitized,
   and only one individual parasite was found on the infected fish. In
   contrast, all blue tang were infected with an average of ten parasites
   per fish. These results suggest that invasive lionfish are not highly
   susceptible to N. pargueraensis, which may contribute to their
   successful invasion of the Caribbean.

AB P>The disposal of scrap tires is one of the biggest solid waste issues
   facing some small island developing states (SIDS) in the Caribbean.
   Dominica is a small Caribbean island nation that seeks to maintain its
   well-founded image as the "Nature Island of the Caribbean." The economy
   has seen a steadily increasing import of both tires and cars, with no
   mechanism for exportation of spent tires. This study used data gathered
   from both government and international sources to estimate the quantity
   of tires currently on the island and projected each year up to 2020 to
   determine potential reuse options. We performed a material flow analysis
   (MFA) using tire import, vehicle registration records, and projected per
   capita income to determine the expected accumulation of waste tires.
   Vehicle registration is expected to rise with the island's wealth, which
   will affect the annual flow of tires. Two methods were used to predict
   vehicle growth over time. Our analysis showed an average waste tire
   output from the economy of 47,000 to 50,000 passenger tire equivalents
   (PTEs) per year, or approximately 470 to 500 short tons per year of
   mass. Such an output does not justify large expenditures of tire
   shredding and processing equipment, but whole tire applications may be
   feasible as potential disposition options. The methods can be easily
   replicated to give low-range and high-range estimates of waste tires
   disposed in the environment.

   copepod species have been described so far in the Pacific, Gulf of
   Mexico and the Mexican Caribbean Sea? Are there more species in one
   place than in other? What proportion of worldwide copepod species are in
   Mexican waters? In the Gulf of Mexico and Caribbean Sea, 193 species
   having been identified, and in the Pacific, 197. The number of species
   common to both areas is 128. The Pacific area is as diverse as the
   Atlantic ocean. The proportion of the species inhabiting Mexican waters
   is difficult to determine, but because Mexico is influenced by
   subarctic, subtropical, and tropical currents, a well as the increase of
   study areas, it is expected Mexico would be one of countries with the
   greatest diversity of copepoda.

AB The current discussion of anticipated climate change impacts and future
   sea level rise is particularly relevant to small island states. An
   increase in natural hazards, such as floods and storm waves, is likely
   to have a devastating impact on small islands' coastlines, severely
   affecting targeted sustainable development. Coastal erosion, notably
   human-induced erosion, has been an ongoing threat to small island
   biodiversity, resources, infrastructure, and settlements, as well as
   society at large. In the context of climate change, the problem of
   coastal erosion and the debate surrounding it is gaining momentum.
   Before attributing associated impacts to climate change, current human
   activities need to be analysed, focusing not only on geomorphological
   and climatological aspects, but also on political and traditional
   cultural frameworks. The objective of this paper is to demonstrate the
   importance of the social-political-ecological systems analysis for
   adaptation strategies, and thus for future sustainable development.
   Coastal use is based on human constructs of the coast, as well as local
   perceptions and values ascribed to the coast. We use the case study of
   Anjouan, Comoros to differentiate between constructive and destructive
   practices on the coast, from both a mental and technical perspective.
   Beach erosion is described as more than a resource problem that
   manifests itself locally rather than nationally. Divergent political
   scales of interest impact future development as much as local action.
   Local action is not least framed by mental contribution and attribution
   of coasts as places for living, recreation and resource use. The present
   case study demonstrates that mental constructs of coasts as valuable
   areas can, in some cases, lead to the protection and preservation of
   beaches by initiatives of collective action. At the same time, local
   communities see the negative impacts of sand mining as causes of coastal
   erosion and, therefore, it is difficult to mobilize them to adapt to
   climate change and sea level rise.

AB Dietary assessment of Late Ceramic Age inhabitants (similar to AD
   1200-1500) from Lavoutte, Saint Lucia, Lesser Antilles was undertaken on
   human skeletal remains using stable carbon and nitrogen isotope analysis
   of bone collagen (delta C-13(co) and delta N-15), and bone and enamel
   bioapatite (delta C-13(ap) and delta C-13(en)). The isotope data were
   interpreted in the context of regional food webs, intra-population
   dietary variation was assessed relative to individual demographic
   variables and the results were compared to contemporaneous populations
   at multiple scales. Moderately enriched delta C-13(co) and elevated
   delta N-15 point to substantial contributions from both non-marine and
   marine protein sources, including nitrogen-enriched pelagic resources.
   The lack of correlations between delta C-13(co) and delta C-13(ap) (or
   delta C-13(en)) suggests distinct isotopic differences between protein
   and energy sources. The smaller range and variance of delta C-13(co) and
   delta N-15 values relative to delta C-13(ap) and Delta C-13(ap-co)
   indicate greater inter-individual heterogeneity in dietary energy
   sources relative to protein sources. Intra-population dietary variation
   was not, however, correlated with either age or sex, consistent with
   communal-based food consumption practices. From a broader perspective,
   the collagen isotope results are comparable with several islands in the
   Lesser Antilles but are distinct from others, indicating a large degree
   of regional variation in dietary protein sources, while the bone (and
   enamel) apatite results are more variable and overlap with many islands
   in both the Greater and Lesser Antilles indicating wider variation in
   average (whole) diets. The relative enrichment in delta C-13(ap) and
   higher Delta C-13(ap-co) values are strongly indicative that C-4 (e.g.,
   maize) or CAM plants were important dietary components. Overall, the
   isotopic evidence suggests that the Lavoutte population consumed mixed
   diets including substantial contributions of both C-3 and C-4/CAM plant
   resources, as well as terrestrial and marine protein sources. (C) 2015

AB The Maldives, one of the Small Island Developing States (SIDS) with
   great solar potential, is keen to promote renewable energy systems to
   reduce its heavy reliance on imported diesel for power generation.
   However, adopting renewable energy systems is still burdensome for the
   Maldives not only because of its high initial costs and insufficient
   financial resources but also because of a lack of understanding about
   whether the deployment of a renewable system is economically feasible.
   Therefore, the concept of grid parity is explored as an important
   concept in this paper to examine the possible timeframe for reaching it.
   A distinctive feature of the paper is that the paper used actual cost
   and technical information to analyze the levelized cost of energy
   (LCOEs) of the independent renewable system in a remote island and
   examined its timeframe for reaching the grid parity condition. Based on
   economic and technical information from a project for replacing existing
   diesel generator to photovoltaic (PV) with energy storage system (ESS)
   in Kuda Bandos Island in the Maldives, the paper considers three
   different system configurations and evaluates which configuration could
   result in the most optimal off-grid energy systems in this remote
   island. With sensitivity analysis on various uncertainties, the paper
   shows the range of the levelized costs of energy and the periods
   required for reaching grid parity for deploying solar photovoltaics and
   ESSs in Kuda Bandos Island, Maldives. The result indicates that the
   photovoltaic system is an economically feasible option for the resort,
   and that grid parity can be reached within the project lifetime.
   However, the result shows that the use of advanced ESSs is still an
   expensive option and would not be economically reasonable.

AB Do the ecological traits of tropical snakes differ from those of
   temperate-zone species? We examined preserved specimens in museums to
   quantify body sizes, sexual dimorphism, dietary habits, and reproductive
   cycles of the proteroglyphous snake lineages endemic to New Guinea and
   the Solomon Islands for comparison with previously-studied Australian
   and Asian species. The Melanesian snakes comprise a diverse group in
   terms of body sizes (adult sizes from < 50 cm to > 1 meter), body shapes
   (slender to heavybodied), and behavior (nocturnal to diurnal). Males
   attain larger sizes than do females in Aspidomorphus and Micropechis,
   but the reverse is true in Loveridgelaps, Salomonelaps, and
   Toxicocalamus. Aspidomorphus and Toxicocalamus show significant sex
   differences in relative head length, but species in the other genera do
   not. All taxa for which we have data on reproductive mode are oviparous,
   and produce an average of 3 to 9 large eggs per clutch. Relative to
   maternal body sizes, Melanesian elapids have significantly smeller
   clutches than do Australian elapids. The two smaller-bodied genera
   showed dietary specialisation (on earthworms by Toxicocalamus, and on
   skinks by Aspidomorphus). Toxicocalamus and the Fijian Ogmodon are thus
   the only Old World elapids to specialise on invertebrate prey. The
   largerbodied taxa (Loveridgelaps, Micropechis, Salomonelaps) have more
   generalised diets, consisting primarily of lizards and frogs. The

AB This study presents a binary classification model for the prediction of
   tropical cyclone (TC) activity in the Fiji, Samoa, and Tonga regions
   (the FST region) using the accumulated cyclone energy (ACE) as a proxy
   of TC activity. A probit regression model, which is a suitable
   probability model for describing binary response data, is developed to
   determine at least a few months in advance (by July in this case) the
   probability that an upcoming TC season may have for high or low TC
   activity. Years of "high TC activity" are defined as those years when
   ACE values exceeded the sample climatology (i.e., the 1985-2008 mean
   value). Model parameters are determined using the Bayesian method.
   Various combinations of the El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) indices
   and large-scale environmental conditions that are known to affect TCs in
   the FST region are examined as potential predictors. It was found that a
   set of predictors comprising low-level relative vorticity, upper-level
   divergence, and midtropspheric relative humidity provided the best skill
   in terms of minimum hindcast error. Results based on hindcast
   verification clearly suggest that the model predicts TC activity in the
   FST region with substantial skill up to the May-July preseason for all
   years considered in the analysis, in particular for ENSO-neutral years
   when TC activity is known to show large variations.

AB Located in the Indian Ocean, Mauritius is among the Small Island
   Developing States (SIDS), entirely reliant on coal, petroleum and some
   locally available renewable energy sources to satisfy energy needs.
   22.7% of the electricity is generated by biomass, solar, landfill gas
   and hydro and the remaining by fossil fuels. Even with continual oil
   price volatilities and specific economic, social and environmental
   vulnerabilities compared to continental areas, Mauritius has
   successfully provided 100% electricity to all its residents. However,
   with a growth in population and economy, Mauritius faces a crucial
   challenge to supply more electrical power to all requiring sectors.
   Renewable energy appears to be the most effective solution to cater for
   the increase in electricity demand but there are still huge challenges
   to overcome for massive deployment of more renewable energy. In this
   context, this paper reviews the current electricity industry and fuel
   sources for electricity production in Mauritius. It also describes
   future energy policies for more renewable energy integration within the
   energy mix by 2025.

AB Based on new U-Th ages of corals drilled offshore Barbados, Abdul et al.
   (2016) have confirmed the existence of the abrupt stratigraphic feature
   called meltwater pulse 1B (MWP-1B), which they interpret as being due to
   a very large and global sea level step change dated at about 11.3 kyr
   before present (approximately 15 m and equivalent to twice the amount of
   water stored in the present Greenland ice sheet). This contrasts with
   the Tahiti record, in which MWP-1B is essentially absent or very small,
   as Carlson and Clark (2012) and Lambeck et al. (2014) also conclude in
   their recent reviews of deglacial sea levels at the global scale.
   However, the evidence provided by Abdul et al. and their main
   conclusions are not convincing as they are affected by the following
   three main problems, which may explain the apparent discrepancies:
   Problem #1/Barbados is located in a subduction zone, which was also
   active throughout the Late Glacial period. Furthermore, the Barbados
   cores studied by Abdul et al. were drilled on both sides of the
   extension of a tectonic feature identified at the southern tip of
   Barbados (South Point) as underlined by several studies of the Barbados
   stratigraphy. Problem #2/Fossil samples of Acropora palmata may not be
   reliable sea level markers during rapid and large sea level rises.
   Indeed, the asexual reproduction strategy of this species may not be
   optimal to keep up when the water depth is increasing very rapidly. This
   may in part explain why the living depth of A. palmata at Barbados was
   significantly greater than 5 m during some periods of the last
   deglaciation, notably between 14.5 and 14 kyr B.P. and possibly between
   14 and 11.5 kyr B.P. Problem #3/The slow glacio-isostatic adjustment and
   the rapid responses due to gravitational changes of ice and water masses
   complicate the interpretation of individual relative sea level (RSL)
   records at specific locations. Therefore, the Barbados and Tahiti record
   cannot be compared directly in terms of absolute sea level values as
   done by Abdul et al. In addition, different glaciohydroisostatic
   adjustments at the two sites may also have contributed to the observed
   discrepancy between their deglacial RSL records.

AB Although research on parasite biodiversity has intensified recently,
   there are signs that parasites remain an underestimated component of
   total biodiversity in many regions of the planet. To identify
   geographical hotspots of parasite diversity, we performed qualitative
   and quantitative analyses of the parasite-host associations in fishes
   from Latin America and the Caribbean, a region that includes known
   hotspots of plant and animal biodiversity. The database included 10 904
   metazoan parasite-host associations involving 1660 fish species. The
   number of host species with at least 1 parasite record was less than 10%
   of the total known fish species in the majority of countries.
   Associations involving adult endoparasites in actinopterygian fish hosts
   dominated the database. Across the whole region, no significant
   difference in parasite species richness was detected between marine and
   freshwater fishes. As a rule, host body size and study effort (number of
   studies per fish species) were good predictors of parasite species
   richness. Some interesting patterns emerged when we included only the
   regions with highest fish species biodiversity and studs, effort
   (Brasil, Mexico and the Caribbean Islands). Independently of differences
   in study effort or host body sizes, Mexico stands out as a hotspot of
   parasite diversity for freshwater fishes, as does Brasil for marine
   fishes. However, among 57 marine fish species common to all 3 regions,
   populations from the Caribbean consistently harboured more parasite
   species. These differences may reflect true biological patterns, or
   regional discrepancies in study effort and local priorities for fish
   parasitology research.

AB The recent irruption of Pacific red lionfish (Pterois volitans) on
   Caribbean and Atlantic coral reefs could prove to be one of the most
   damaging marine invasions to date. Invasive lionfish are reaching
   densities much higher than those reported from their native range, and
   they have a strong negative effect on the recruitment and abundance of a
   broad diversity of native coral-reef fishes. Otherwise, little is known
   about how lionfish affect native coral-reef communities, especially
   compared to ecologically similar native predators. A controlled field
   experiment conducted on small patch-reefs in the Bahamas over an
   8-week-period demonstrated that (1) lionfish caused a reduction in the
   abundance of small native coral-reef fishes that was 2.5 +/- A 0.5 times
   (mean +/- A SEM) greater than that caused by a similarly sized native
   piscivore, the coney grouper Cephalopholis fulva (93.7 vs. 36.3 %
   reduction); (2) lionfish caused a reduction in the species richness of
   small coral-reef fishes (loss of 4.6 +/- A 1.6 species), whereas the
   native piscivore did not have a significant effect on prey richness; (3)
   the greatest effects on the reef-fish community, in terms of both
   abundance and richness, occurred when both native and invasive predators
   were present; and (4) lionfish grew significantly faster (> 6 times)
   than the native predator under the same field conditions. These results
   suggest that invasive lionfish have stronger ecological effects than
   similarly sized native piscivores, and may pose a substantial threat to
   native coral-reef fish communities.

AB The diversity and ecology of meiofauna in caves is largely unknown.
   Therefore, we studied one anchialine and five freshwater caves in
   November 2014 and January 2016 in western Cuba. We recorded 10
   invertebrate taxa with the most abundant being: Nematoda, Ostracoda,
   Acari and Copepoda. The meiofauna communities in the caves were
   relatively impoverished probably due to the combination of oligotrophic
   conditions and limited colonization by organisms from outside. We found
   28 nematode taxa of which 23 never have been previously reported
   inhabiting caves. The previously exclusive marine genera Desmodora and
   Paralongicyatholaimus were reported for the first time in freshwater
   environments. Ironus cf. ignavus was the most abundant species in
   agreement with studies elsewhere. In freshwater caves, water runoff and
   organism dispersal from the surface likely determines the colonization
   of the sediment. Parthenogenetic and predatory/omnivore nematodes
   dominated in the studied caves probably due to the physical isolation
   and oligotrophy in the underground systems.

AB The Coral Triangle Initiative is an ambitious attempt to conserve the
   marine biodiversity hotspot known as the Coral Triangle. However, the
   reef fauna in many nearby regions remains poorly explored and,
   consequently, the focus on the Coral Triangle risks overlooking other
   areas of high conservation significance. One region of potential
   significance, Aceh, Indonesia, has not been visited by coral taxonomists
   since the Dutch colonial period. Here we document the species richness
   of scleractinian corals of Pulau Weh, Aceh. We also compare the species
   richness of the genus Acropora at 3-5 sites in each of nine regions in
   Indonesia and Papua New Guinea. Although dominated by widespread
   Indo-Pacific species, the coral fauna of Pulau Weh is also the eastern
   and western boundary for many Indian Ocean and Pacific Ocean species,
   respectively. We identified a total of 133 scleractinian species, of
   which three have been previously recorded only in the western Indian
   Ocean and five are presently undescribed. The mean species richness of
   the Acropora at Pulau Weh is similar to regions within the Coral
   Triangle. This high species richness plus the high proportion of
   endemics suggests that the Andaman Sea is of similarly high conservation
   value to the Coral Triangle. We suggest that an international initiative
   similar to the Coral Triangle Initiative is required to conserve this
   region, which includes the territorial waters of six countries.

AB Coral reef ecosystems are under a variety of threats from global change
   and anthropogenic disturbances that are reducing the number and type of
   coral species on reefs. Coral reefs support upwards of one third of all
   marine species of fish, so the loss of coral habitat may have
   substantial consequences to local fish diversity. We posit that the
   effects of habitat degradation will be most severe in coral regions with
   highest biodiversity of fishes due to greater specialization by fishes
   for particular coral habitats. Our novel approach to this important but
   untested hypothesis was to conduct the same field experiment at three
   geographic locations across the Indo-Pacific biodiversity gradient
   (Papua New Guinea; Great Barrier Reef, Australia; French Polynesia).
   Specifically, we experimentally explored whether the response of local
   fish communities to identical changes in diversity of habitat-providing
   corals was independent of the size of the regional species pool of
   fishes. We found that the proportional reduction (sensitivity) in fish
   biodiversity to loss of coral diversity was greater for regions with
   larger background species pools, reflecting variation in the degree of
   habitat specialization of fishes across the Indo-Pacific diversity
   gradient. This result implies that habitat-associated fish in diversity
   hotspots are at greater risk of local extinction to a given loss of
   habitat diversity compared to regions with lower species richness. This
   mechanism, related to the positive relationship between habitat
   specialization and regional biodiversity, and the elevated extinction
   risk this poses for biodiversity hotspots, may apply to species in other
   types of ecosystems.

   average 456% and 541% higher, respectively, in unfished sites. Ecosystem
   fragmentation resulted in significant reductions of recycling rates by
   snapper, with degree of creek fragmentation explaining 86% and 72% of
   the variance in estimated excretion for dissolved N and P, respectively.
   Additionally, we used nutrient limitation assays and primary producer
   nutrient content to provide a simple example of how marine fishery
   declines may affect primary production. This study provides an initial
   step toward integrating marine fishery declines and consumer-driven
   nutrient recycling to more fully understand the implications of human
   impacts in marine ecosystems.

AB Epigonus okamotoi Fricke, 2017 was originally described on the basis of
   a single specimen collected from New Britain, Papua New Guinea during
   one of the exploratory cruises (campaign: MADEEP) in 2014 organized
   under the Tropical Deep-Sea Benthos program. However, there are no clear
   differences in the meristic and morphometric characters between the
   holotype of the new species and specimens of E. draco Okamoto, 2015,
   including two additional specimens of the species found in the
   ichthyological collections in the NTUM. The genetic distance
   (p-distance) between the two "species" at the COI locus was negligible.
   Accordingly, the holotype of E. okamotoi is considered to be a specimen
   of E. draco, and the former nominal species is reduced to a junior
   synonym of E. draco. In addition, we rediagnose and report new
   distributional records for E. atherinoides (Gilbert, 1905) and E.
   lifouensis Okamoto & Motomura, 2013 in the West Pacific.

AB We made an assessment of the levels of radionuclides in the ocean
   waters, seafloor and groundwater at Bikini and Enewetak Atolls where the
   US conducted nuclear weapons tests in the 1940's and 50's. This included
   the first estimates of submarine groundwater discharge (SGD) derived
   from radium isotopes that can be used here to calculate radionuclide
   fluxes in to the lagoon waters. While there is significant variability
   between sites and sample types, levels of plutonium (Pu-239,Pu-240)
   remain several orders of magnitude higher in lagoon seawater and
   sediments than what is found in rest of the world's oceans. In contrast,
   levels of cesium-137 (Cs-137) while relatively elevated in brackish
   groundwater are only slightly higher in the lagoon water relative to
   North Pacific surface waters. Of special interest was the Runit dome, a
   nuclear waste repository created in the 1970's within the Enewetak
   Atoll. Low seawater ratios of Pu-240/Pu-239 suggest that this area is
   the source of about half of the Pu in the Enewetak lagoon water column,
   yet radium isotopes suggest that SGD from below the dome is not a
   significant Pu source. SGD fluxes of Pu and Cs at Bikini were also
   relatively low. Thus radioactivity associated with seafloor sediments
   remains the largest source and long term repository for radioactive
   contamination. Overall, Bikini and Enewetak Atolls are an ongoing source
   of Pu and Cs to the North Pacific, but at annual rates that are orders
   of magnitude smaller than delivered via close-in fallout to the same
   area. (c) 2017 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB An important part of Biotechnology development is the training of human
   resources at all levels. Preparing our countries to meet and the
   development of these technologies and their impact on agriculture is an
   objective of priority of this PhD on Biotechnology for Agriculture,
   Animal Mention. The variety of scientific disciplines involved in the
   development of biotechnology requires the contribution of experts from
   areas ranging from classical genetics to innovation in biotechnology
   industries, passing through cellular and molecular biologists,
   biochemists, microbiologists and bio-informatics. The social impact of
   this technology requires a reflection on the ethical and legal aspects
   that raise its development, hence the inclusion of the ethics and
   philosophy of science, as well as the criteria for Intellectual
   Property. Agricultural Biotechnology is a tool of particular importance
   to achieve the agroalimentary sovereignty of the countries members of
   ALBA, thus training talents at the highest level in the area will
   definitively contribute to achieve this goal. Moreover, the diffusion of
   knowledge in Agricultural Biotechnology will enable our people moving
   closer to a scientific discipline that was virtually restricted to large
   international corporations of science and technology. In this paper, the
   design of a doctoral program curriculum is presented for the training of
   high-level professionals capable of planning, managing, directing,
   developing, implementing and evaluating scientific research,
   technological innovation and production in the area of animal
   biotechnology with the aim to enhance sustainable and endogenous
   development promoting people security and food sovereignty specifically
   the countries members of ALBA.
X4 Una parte importante del desarrollo de la Biotecnología lo constituye la

   el desarrollo de la Biotecnología exige la contribución de expertos de
   áreas que van desde la genética clásica, hasta la innovación en
   industrias biotecnológicas, pasando por biólogos celulares y
   moleculares, bioquímicos, microbiólogos y bioinformáticos. El impacto
   social de esta tecnología exige una reflexión sobre aspectos éticos y
   legales que plantea su desarrollo, de ahí la incorporación de la ética y
   los aspectos filosóficos de la Ciencia, así como los criterios de la
   Propiedad Industrial e Intelectual. La Biotecnología Agrícola es una
   herramienta de particular importancia para lograr la soberanía
   agroalimentaria de nuestros países miembros del ALBA, por lo tanto,
   formar talentos al más alto nivel en el área, contribuirá de manera
   definitiva con esta meta. Por otra parte, la difusión de los
   conocimientos en Biotecnología Agrícola permitirá a nuestros pueblos un
   mayor acercamiento a una disciplina científica que estaba prácticamente
   reservada a las grandes corporaciones internacionales de la ciencia y la
   tecnología. En el presente trabajo se presenta el diseño de un programa
   doctoral curricular para la formación de profesionales de alto nivel
   capaces de planificar, gestionar, dirigir, desarrollar, ejecutar y
   evaluar investigaciones científicas, innovaciones tecnológicas y
   producción de insumos en el área de la biotecnología agrícola animal con
   el fin de potenciar un desarrollo endógeno sustentable y con miras a
   favorecer la seguridad y soberanía alimentaría de lo nuestros pueblos

   living in and on soft aquatic substrates. Meiofaunal organisms, which
   have representatives of almost all invertebrate phyla, are smaller than
   macrofauna. The meiofauna of Singapore has never been explored. In the
   present study, we show results from the first exploration of the marine
   meiofauna of this geographical region. Several of the localities sampled
   yielded specimens of the meiofaunal groups Tardigrada, Kinorhyncha
   and/or meiofaunal Rhabditophora (Platyhelminthes). In the future,
   quantitative and qualitative studies would be required to assess the
   geographical distribution, as well as population density and taxon
   richness of the meiofaunal community in Singapore.

AB In archaeology, human-introduced animals provide clues about social
   interaction and movement of past peoples. Zooarchaeological records in
   the Caribbean show that pre-Columbian people introduced several South
   American mammals to different islands. This article examines all
   reported pre-Columbian zooarchaeological records of domesticated guinea
   pigs (Cavia porcellus) in the Caribbean. Thus far, 218 bone fragments
   have been identified from 18 sites on nine islands. To date, our
   analysis indicates that guinea pigs were introduced to the islands after
   AD 500, possibly to the Greater Antilles first. Almost all are recovered
   from midden contexts. The contexts of guinea pig remains suggest that
   these animals were consumed as food and not considered an exotic or
   high-status food source with restricted consumption or other non-food
   uses such as ritual animals. The spatial and temporal patterns of guinea
   pigs suggest that the animals may have been linked to social identity
   and new patterns of trade, interaction, or population movement between
   the Caribbean and South America during the second half of the Caribbean
   Ceramic Age. Documenting the distribution and social significance of
   guinea pigs in the pre-Columbian Caribbean contributes to our
   understanding of how and why people introduced animals to island
   settings.

AB Most small island states are under economic pressure to transition from
   energy systems dominated by imported oil, into systems based on clean
   energy technologies, which are often already economically viable due to
   local high energy prices. Guidance on transforming energy systems is
   limited with few examples available to policy makers. This paper applies
   a technological innovation system approach to recording the development
   of the much-lauded Barbados solar water heating industry and applies
   Bergek et al.'s (2008) functional analysis approach to put forward
   reasons for its successful adoption. The research concludes that the
   Barbados solar water heater industry actually appears to be in a state
   of market stagnation (at around 35% penetration) and using functional
   analysis identifies barriers and opportunities for future growth in the
   local and regional solar hot water heater market, as well as proposing
   the key actor networks necessary for success in sustainable energy
   technology based innovation system for small island states. (C) 2016

AB If current trends of declining fertility rates and increasing
   abandonment of rural land as a result of urbanization continue, this
   will signal a globally significant transformation with important
   consequences for policy makers interested in conservation planning. This
   transformation is presently evident in a number of countries and
   projections suggest it may occur in the future in many developing
   countries. We use rates of population growth and urbanization to project
   population trends in rural areas for 25 example countries. Our
   projections indicate a general decline in population density that has
   either occurred already (e.g., Mexico) or may occur in the future if
   current trends continue (e.g., Uganda). Using both temperate and
   tropical examples we present evidence that this process will lead to
   ecological homogenization as a dominant habitat (e.g., forest replaces a
   mosaic of human-maintained landscapes), resulting in declines in
   biodiversity at the local scale. Building on this information, we
   consider research programs that need to be conducted so that policy
   makers are prepared to effectively manage depopulated rural areas.

AB The seroprevalence of leptospirosis in water buffalo (Bubalus bubalis)
   reared for meat in semi-intensive and extensive managed farms in
   Trinidad was determined. All sera were tested for specific antibodies
   against 17 internationally recognized serovars of Leptospira using the
   microscopic agglutination test (MAT). Animals with titres greater or
   equal to 100 were considered as seropositive indicating exposure to
   Leptospira and those with titres greater or equal to 800 were
   interpreted as cases of acute leptospirosis. Of a total of 226
   apparently healthy water buffalo from five major farms in Trinidad
   tested, 33 (14.6%) were seropositive with titres ranging from 100 to
   400. Three (60.0%) of 5 Farms had seropositive animals with
   seropositivity rates ranging from 2.0% (1 of 50) on Farm A to 32.7% (16
   of 49) on Farm B. The difference was statistically significant (P<0.05;
   X(2)). Age and sex of animals had no significant (P>0.05; X(1)) effect
   on infection rate. The prevalent antibodies to serovars of Leptospira
   were farm-specific with specific antibodies to serovars Copenhageni and
   Georgia being predominant on Farm B having been detected in 10 (62.5%)
   and 9 (56.3%) respectively of 16 seropositive animals. On Farm D
   however, also with 16 seropositive animals, specific antibodies to
   serovars Patoc and Bratislava were most frequently detected, found in 11
   (68.8%) and 5 (31.3%) respectively of seropositive animals. This is the
   first documentation of leptospirosis in water buffalo in the Caribbean
   region and the health risk posed to farm workers, abattoir workers and
   veterinarians cannot be ignored.

   States which qualify as small island developing States (SIDS); this
   fishery is managed by the Western and Central Pacific Fisheries
   Commission (WCPFC). On account of the majority they represent, the SIDS
   strive for the adoption of measures which would benefit them. This
   article discusses the effect of these measures which may give the
   impression that the delicate balance reached with the adoption of the
   LOSC between the rights of coastal States and other States is being
   upset; this can be regarded as a kind of 'creeping jurisdiction'. Three
   issues are considered: the quasi-exemption of application of many rules
   by the SIDS, the issue of the application of the Convention in the
   various areas under national jurisdiction and the requirements for the

AB Penaeid and carid communities were assessed in St Lucia over a wide
   range of saline conditions, water level conditions and mouth states,
   including a six-month marine connection and various connections to the
   Mfolozi Estuary. Samples were collected biannually in spring and autumn
   from November 2004 to May 2012 using seine nets. Seven penaeid and seven
   carid species were recorded, of which Palaemon pacificus, P. peringueyi,
   Penaeus indicus and Metapenaeus monoceros were the most abundant. The
   decline from 2004 to 2007 in both species recorded and densities of
   freshwater, estuarine and marine species during the initial closed
   period was linked to increased salinity, lack of recruitment and reduced
   estuarine surface area. Increased wave action and high seas following
   Cyclone Gamede opened the mouth in March 2007 after a 57-month closed
   period, resulting in recruitment of marine species, predominantly P.
   indicus, followed by a decline in densities after reclosure in August
   2007. Increases in marine and freshwater species were evident after
   Mfolozi flood connections during 2008, 2009 and 2010. Highest densities
   were recorded after breaching in 2007 and after flood connections,
   highlighting the importance of a marine link to maintain the recruitment
   of penaeid species.

AB Floating detritus, a unique microcosm, acts as a reservoir of diverse
   microalgae and meiofauna in mangrove areas found in Twin Cays, Belize.
   The Lair, Boston Bay, Hidden Creek and Main Channel, four locations
   within Twin Cays, were used as the study sites. Large suspended detrital
   aggregates are specialized environments where benthic photosynthetic and
   heterotrophic organisms thrive as suspended free-floating cells in the
   water column. On the water surface, patches of detritus, a combination
   of benthic organisms, dinoflagellates, diatoms, cyanobacteria and
   dinoflagellate cysts, are enclosed in a matrix of fibers. Heterotrophic
   organisms are also numerous in floating detritus. Phagotrophic fauna,
   along with nematodes, ciliates, copepods and crustacean larvae, rely on
   small algal forms in detritus as their food source. Vertical
   distribution and species composition of microalgae and associated
   meiofauna in rising and sinking detritus aggregates are reported using
   water-depth and time-series studies. The biodiversity of dinoflagellates
   included a total of 38 species, 15 potentially harmful species, and
   eight neritic species. Populations of benthic dinoflagellates in
   floating detritus were measured against total cell counts and found to
   represent 28-43% in the Lair and 18-68% in Boston Bay. The highest
   concentration of dinoflagellate species were identified as being:
   Bysmatrum subsalsum, Prorocentrum caribbeanum, Prorocentrum elegans and
   Prorocentrum mexicanum. All other dinoflagellates were one to two orders
   of magnitude lower in cell numbers. Dominant meiofauna organisms were
   nematodes and ciliates in detritus. Illegal dumping of domestic waste in
   the Lair caused dinoflagellates to disappear from floating detritus and
   their recovery is briefly described.

AB Species of the toadfish genus Opsanus are increasingly used as
   experimental organisms in biomedicine and evolutionary/ecological
   physiology. Despite their importance, little is known of the
   phylogenetic relationships among Opsanus species. DNA sequence data for
   portions of the mitochondrial 12S rRNA, cytochrome oxidase I and
   cytochrome b genes were generated and analyzed from the four recognized
   Opsanus species and three outgroup taxa. Results of these analyses
   indicate an evolutionarily rapid divergence of three lineages within the
   genus. O. beta and O. pardus were resolved within the same lineage, and
   could not be distinguished with these mitochondrial sequence data. These
   data and paleoclimatic theory support a hypothesis of speciation based
   on the formation of allopatric populations during periods of elevated
   water temperature in the northern Caribbean.

AB We documented one of the most species-rich assemblages of tropical
   rain-forest Auchenorrhyncha, comprising 402 phloem-and xylem-feeding
   species, by sampling adults from forest vegetation. Further, we reared
   106 species from larvae sampled on 14 plant species. Both xylem-and
   phloem-feeding guilds exhibited wide host-plant ranges, as 74% of
   species fed on more than one plant family. In comparison, using data
   extracted from the temperate-zone literature, phloem-feeders exhibited
   lower host specificity in Papua New Guinea than in Germany, because in
   Papua New Guinea they were dominated by generalist Fulgoroidea while in
   Germany by specialist Membracoidea. The similarity of Auchenorrhyncha
   assemblages from different plant species was unrelated to the
   phylogenetic distance between their hosts. Host specificity, abundance
   and species composition of Auchenorrhyncha assemblages were unrelated to
   the optimum of their host plant species on succession gradient from
   secondary to primary forest. Higher host specificity did not lead to
   greater species richness in Auchenorrhyncha assemblages feeding on
   different plant species, but the number of species feeding on a
   particular plant species was a strong predictor of the Auchenorrhyncha
   abundance on that plant. These patterns suggest that Auchenorrhyncha
   assemblages on these plant species are not saturated with species and
   determined by division of limited resources among competitors, but
   instead are dependent on the number of colonizers from the regional
   species pool.

AB No-take marine reserves have been used to promote biodiversity
   conservation and have increasingly been implemented with the goal of
   rebuilding depleted fish stocks. Yet, marine reserves may cause some
   species to decrease in abundance while others increase, in part because
   species are not equally impacted by the effort displaced from the
   reserve into surrounding fished areas. We evaluate temporal patterns in
   the abundance and distribution of reef fishes at Glover's Atoll, Belize,
   where a no-take reserve was enforced in 1998. For the set of commercial
   species investigated in our study, the most important variable in
   predicting species responses to reserve protection was the pre-reserve
   spatial distribution of fishes with respect to reserve boundaries.
   Variation in species responses to protection could not be attributed to
   benthic habitat degradation, but maximum body length and trophic level
   were both positively correlated with response to protection. We suggest
   that reserve implementation caused mortality rates to increase for some
   fish species that were originally distributed in higher abundances
   outside reserve boundaries, leading to declines in abundance in these
   populations. These findings highlight the importance of incorporating
   knowledge on spatial distributions of fishes when designing and
   monitoring marine reserves. Our methods can be used by reserve managers
   to predict the responses of individual species to protection at the time
   of reserve implementation, thereby facilitating agreement between the
   expectations of fishery managers and the needs of stakeholders.

AB Sago is a starchy food processed from the pith of the sago palm.
   Although it is their staple in the lean time between the harvests of
   more savory options, the Abelam people of Papua New Guinea do not relish
   it. The interlude between yam harvests has been called the "hungry time"
   (though there is plenty to eat) both because of the perceived
   unpalatability of sago and the monotony of a sago-based diet. But the
   sago palm has many advantages: it is long-lived, requires little
   attention, and can be harvested almost any time. It serves both as
   seasonal fare and as an emergency food supply for hard times, insuring
   against crop failure and providing food security. Sago protected the
   Abelam during the severe drought of 1997-98 and its aftermath, and is
   now supplementing their diet as they recover from the 2015 El Nino
   drought. Why, then, is it so disparaged? This article argues that Abelam
   traditionally regarded themselves as "People of the Yam," viewing sago
   as prototypically "Not Yam." Sago grows in less preferred environments
   with little effort. Its consistency and taste, symbolism, and imagery
   are all in direct opposition to the yam. By acting as a foil for the
   yam, sago allows Abelam to reinforce their distinctiveness as a people.
   Disdaining sago provides an avenue for expressing self-identity and
   valorizing a preferred food.

AB The implementation of marine protected areas (MPAs) for fisheries
   management has increased recently due to the perceived role of MPAs in
   conserving biodiversity, increasing fish stocks, and enhancing the food
   security of coastal communities. However, it is unclear whether MPAs may
   restrict the availability of marine resources and decrease overall food
   security and the health of the people. In the Roviana Lagoon of the
   Solomon Islands, we conducted cross-comparisons of villages with MPAs
   and a village without an MPA to assess whether MPAs influenced local
   perceptions of governance, environmental change, livelihood strategies,
   and actual human nutrition and health. Results showed that residents of
   villages with effective MPAs had higher energy and protein intake than
   those who had no MPA or an ineffective MPA. We conclude that
   "no-take"marine reserves do not have adverse effects and that when MPAs
   are effectively sustained they may enhance local nutrition and health.

AB This article explores how the concept of ecosystem ecologies, one of the
   most influential models of systems thinking, was developed in relation
   to the radioactive aftermath of US nuclear weapons testing in the
   Pacific Islands. Historian Richard Grove has demonstrated how tropical
   island colonies all over the globe served as vital laboratories and
   spaces of social, botanical, and industrial experiment in ways that
   informed modernity and the conservation movement. I propose a similar
   relationship between the militarized American island colonies of
   Micronesia and how their constitution as AEC laboratories contributed to
   both atomic modernity and the field of ecosystem ecology. This was
   enacted through metaphorical concepts of island isolation and
   distributed visually by Atomic Energy Commission films that upheld an
   aerial vision of the newly acquired atolls for an American audience.
   Finally, the myth of isolation is also at work in the ways in which
   Marshall Islanders exposed to nuclear fallout became human subjects for
   radiation experiments due to the idea of the biological isolate.

   from a single specimen taken from the Cambridge Gulf, Western Australia,
   and from images of 10 other specimens from northern Australia and Papua
   New Guinea (all observed but not collected). It is a very large ray that
   attains at least 161 cm disc width, making it amongst the largest of the
   whiprays. The ventral tail below the caudal sting has a low, short-based
   fold. A ventral tail fold (or a dorsal fold) has not been recorded for
   any other himanturin stingray in the Indo-West Pacific. Molecular data
   suggest it is most closely related to a similar but more widely
   distributed cognate, U. granulatus. Both of these species share a
   suboval disc shape, similar squamation patterns, and the tail posterior
   to the sting is entirely white (at least in small individuals). U.
   acanthobothrium sp. nov. differs from U. granulatus in having a longer
   and more angular snout, longer tail, more posteriorly inserted caudal
   sting, lacks white flecks on the dorsal surface, and the ventral disc is
   uniformly white (rather than white with a broad black margin). It
   co-occurs with two other morphologically distinct Urogymnus in the
   region (U. asperrimus and U. dalyensis). Like U. dalyensis it occurs in
   both brackish and marine waters. A key is proved to the members of the
   genus Urogymnus.

AB Since 80's, fauna associated to sunken woods has been collected during

   (TDSB). In 2004 we started a specific program of cruises devoted to the
   exploration of sunken-wood habitats. Seven cruises provided sunken-wood
   organisms in depth ranging from 100-1 500 metres, at three locations
   corresponding to large basins of sunken-wood accumulation in the south
   west Pacific: (i) Philippines, (ii) Salomon islands and (iii) Vanuatu.
   Extra-samples from other TDSB cruises are also available. Indeed, far
   from these basins, pieces of woods are unevenly catch by trawling and
   dredging and these erratic substrata, found for example on seamounts,

   different kinds of baits: pieces of wood, blue whale bones, green turtle
   shell, and stag horn. These experiments deployed between 12-30 months
   off New Caledionia and Vanuatu. Samples yielded an abundant and original

AB A new species. Botryocladia iridescens D.L.Ballant. et H.Ruiz is
   described from coral reef habitats in Puerto Rico. The new Species
   possesses 11 brilliant and patterned iridescence and has been collected
   in mid- to deep-water cryptic reef habitats. Botryocladia iridescens is
   diminutive, to 7 mm high and with vesicles to 6 mm in diameter, and most
   commonly produces one or two primary vesicles oil a short simple or once
   forked, solidly parenchymatous axis. Vesicle walls are composed of two
   medullary and two cortical layers. The Vesicles are uniformly covered by
   a surface cortical layer and frequently anastomose laterally with
   contiguous Vesicles of the same or adjacent plants. Spherical to
   pyriform gland cells are borne on inner medullary cells or medullary
   cells which project into the vesicle Cavity. Regrowth of an axis from
   the base of old vesicles is common. Tetrasporangia are cruciately
   divided. measuring 14-20 mu m in diameter and are scattered in the
   cortex. Gametophytes are monoecious, the partially protuberant
   cystocarps Measuring to 500 mu m in diameter. Spermatangia are located
   in discrete clusters and are cut off singly or in pairs from elongate
   spermatangial mother cells. The new species is also recorded from
   Grenada. West Indies.

AB In ratifying the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change
   (UNFCCC), Trinidad and Tobago gave its commitment to contribute towards
   mitigating greenhouse gas emissions and instituting measures for
   adapting to climate change impacts. Formulation of a National Climate
   Change Policy subsequently took place with a view to providing direction
   towards fulfilling UNFCCC obligations.
   The National Climate Change Policy identified that coastal areas of
   Trinidad and Tobago were particularly vulnerable to climate change
   impacts. As a small island State, the country cannot afford its
   productive sectors operating in and/or reliant upon coastal resources to
   be at risk, even as some contribute to the climate change phenomenon.
   The increasing threat to socio-cultural, economic and environmental
   sustainability posed by climate change, was acknowledged in the Draft
   National Integrated Coastal Zone Management (ICZM) Policy Framework
   which aims to treat with climate change impacts in the coastal zone and
   reduce vulnerability to associated hazards.
   Given the stated objectives of the National Climate Change Policy and
   the Draft National ICZM Policy Framework, this paper examined the policy
   and plans in place to integrate climate change considerations into
   management for the coastal sectors of fisheries, energy, tourism and
   maritime transport. It found that the mainstreaming of climate change
   mitigation and adaptation responses in these coastal sectors has not
   been as effective as needed. Progress in this regard was constrained by
   human, financial and technical resource availability. Proposed are
   rationalised institutional arrangements which, if statutorily grounded,
   will better allow for achieving co-ordinated climate change mitigation
   and adaptation outcomes in Trinidad and Tobago. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

   self-administered to 124 consumers who were primarily responsible for
   preparation of foods and owned a refrigerator at home. Data were
   analysed by frequencies and chi-square. Most (97.6%) consumers
   considered safe food practices as 'very important'. Few (8.9%) related
   Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Point to safe food preparation
   practices. Microbiological hazard was ranked as a most serious threat to
   food safety (80.5%). Salmonella was most well known (79.8%). Diarrhoea
   (23.7%) was a common symptom of food-borne illness. More than 50% would
   'always' check for expiry dates on labels, seals and would never
   purchase swollen cans. Only 48.4% consumers used separate cutting boards
   for meats and vegetables 'always'. Some (6.5%) felt it was appropriate
   to give unfit food to someone else. The study identified critical points
   in safe food preparation practices for effective public health
   education.

AB There is a general consensus among Caribbean development planners that
   small-scale agricultural producers commonly referred to as small
   farmers, have an important role to play in sustainable domestic food
   supply and by extension, the food security of the region. In this
   regard, contraction in domestic food supply and increased dependence on
   imported food to meet nutritional demands have been attributed to
   under-utilization of land resources in the small-farming sector. While
   there is some truth to this claim, the adverse situation in the domestic
   food supply of Jamaica and the rest of the Caribbean is intimately
   related to the evolution of small farmers along a dynamic continuum.

AB The Caribbean rainfall season is best characterized by its bimodal
   nature, with an initial peak in May-June and a second more prominent one
   in September-October. This allows for a convenient division into an
   early and a late rainfall season. In this study we examine the rainfall
   patterns of the early rainfall season (mid April to July) for links with
   El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) events. Whereas traditionally ENSO
   events have been identified with dry conditions during the later
   Caribbean rainfall season, recent research suggests a second signal that
   manifests itself as a wet early rainfall season of the year of ENSO
   decline (the El Nino+l year). Two leading empirical orthogonal function
   modes of early season Caribbean rainfall are examined for evidence of
   this. Strong correlations are shown to exist between the first mode and
   wintertime equatorial Pacific anomalies. The first mode explains nearly
   half of the early season variability. The idea that the wintertime
   Pacific anomalies alter the early Caribbean rainfall season via the warm
   spring sea surface temperature anomalies they induce in the north
   tropical Atlantic is also investigated. An atmospheric general
   circulation model is also used to show that, when warm/cold anomalies
   exist across the north tropical Atlantic, this results in a large-scale
   atmospheric circulation that is more/less favourable to rainfall
   production over the Caribbean. Copyright (C) 2002 Royal Meteorological

   Caribbean (Ho = 0.439) and the Pacific coasts (Ho = 0.277) than reported
   for the same species in other locations of Central American Pacific,
   suggesting the deterioration of genetic diversity. All the populations
   showed high inbreeding coefficients (0.131-0.462) indicating
   heterozygotes deficience. The genetic structure between the Colombian
   coasts separated by Central American Isthmus was high (F-RT = 0.39) and
   the analyses of the genetic patterns of A. germinans revealed a clear
   differentiation of populations and no-recent gene flow evidence between
   coasts. Genetic structure was found within each coast (F-ST = 0.10 for
   the Caribbean coast and F-ST = 0.22 for the Pacific coast). The genetic
   patterns along the two coasts appear to reflect a forcing by local
   geomorphology and marine currents. Both coasts constitute a different
   Evolutionary Significant Unit, so we suggest for future transplantations
   plans that propagules or saplings of the populations of the Caribbean
   coast should not be mixed with those of the Pacific Colombian coast.
   Besides, we suggest that reforestation efforts should carefully
   distinguish propagules sources within each coast. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

AB Invasive Indo-Pacific lionfish (Pterois volitans) have rapidly expanded
   in the Western Atlantic over the past decade and have had a significant
   negative impact on reef fish biodiversity, habitat, and community
   structure, with lionfish out-competing native predators for resources.
   In an effort to reduce this population explosion, lionfish have been
   promoted for human consumption in the greater Caribbean region. This
   study examined whether the geographical expansion of the lionfish into a
   known ciguatera-endemic region can pose a human health threat for
   ciguatera fish poisoning (CFP). More than 180 lionfish were collected
   from waters surrounding the US Virgin Islands throughout 2010 and 2011.
   Ciguatoxin testing included an in vitro neuroblastoma cytotoxicity assay
   for composite toxicity assessment of sodium-channel toxins combined with
   confirmatory liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry. A 12%
   prevalence rate of ciguatoxic lionfish exceeding the FDA guidance level
   of 0.1 mu g/kg C-CTX-1 equivalents was identified in fish from the U. S.
   Virgin Islands, highlighting a potential consumption risk in this
   region. This study presents the first evidence that the invasive
   lionfish, pose a direct human health risk for CFP and highlights the
   need for awareness and research on this food safety hazard in known
   endemic areas.

AB Most resource management issues are expressed in ecological imperatives
   to protect threatened resources.  The process of establishing specially
   designated areas such as reserves, parks, or marine sanctuaries follows
   that pattern.  This paper argues, however, that conserving resources is
   not only a bioecological process but a sociocultural one as well.  The
   paper analyzes what happened in establishing two US National Marine
   Sanctuaries:  La Parguera, Puerto Rico, and Fagatele Bay, American
   Samoa.  One case ended in frustration and failure for natural resource
   managers, officials, and citizen supporters; the other ended in
   successful designation of a National Marine Sanctuary.  Each case makes
   a statement about the importance of cultural variables and how they
   influence the process of establishing marine sanctuaries.  After
   examining the case studies, the paper concludes that experiences from
   planned social change are useful for marine protected areas and
   identifies cultural factors that are likely to affect the establishment
   of sanctuaries in marine and coastal areas.

   with intermediate colour pattern between Halichoeres bivittatus and
   Halichoeres garnoti from Belize. Phylogenetic analyses of the two
   species, eight Halichoeres species from new and old world lineages and
   two outgroups showed that the study species are closely related and that
   H. garnoti is the maternal contributor to the putative hybrid specimen,
   based on partial mitochondrial COI data. Direct sequencing of Intron 1
   of the nuclear ribosomal protein S7 identified H. bivittatus as sister
   to H. garnoti with the putative hybrid specimen in an intermediate
   position, due to heterozygosity at nucleotides alternatively fixed in
   the two putative parent species. This is consistent with the hybrid
   status of the specimen, with parental contributions from both H. garnoti
   and H. bivittatus. These results, combined with no evidence of
   introgression between the two parent species (based on the mtDNA and the
   single investigated nuclear marker) and the biogeography and ecology of
   these species suggests that this is a rare event with minimal
   evolutionary implications.

AB Owing to extensive prehistoric extinctions of large frugivores, Pacific
   Pigeons (Ducula pacifica) are thought to be one of the most important
   seed dispersers of large-seeded plants in Tonga, yet little is known
   about their interactions with their food plants. We reviewed their known
   food plants and recorded defaecations, regurgitations, and movement
   patterns of this species over 11 months in Tonga. The fruit of at least
   38 native plant species and the leaf buds of one species are eaten by
   Pacific Pigeons in Tonga. Most defaecations and all regurgitations
   contained a single seed of a single species. Pigeons usually
   regurgitated seeds larger than 20 mm in diameter whereas smaller seeds
   were typically defaecated. On the basis of observed movement patterns in
   Tonga and retention times for Ducula, most seeds are probably dispersed
   away from fruiting trees (85% of regurgitated seeds, 99% of defaecated
   seeds), but within 50 m of the crown. Distances of more than 100 km are
   theoretically possible for defaecated seeds, although pigeon behaviour
   is likely to limit this maximum. Results from this study suggest Pacific
   Pigeons are excellent seed dispersers in Tonga.

AB There has been a marked decline in breast-feeding throughout the
   developing world. It is generally agreed that this trend should be
   reversed, and that in achieving this objective mass communication media
   could play an important role. The present article analyzes the results
   of a campaign to promote breast-feeding in which the press, television,
   and radio were used. It is hoped that this analysis will prove useful
   for other individulas and groups that may wish to plan similar
   campaigns.
AB A 6-week campaign launched by the Housewives Association of Trinidad and
   Tobago in 1974 utilized the press, TV, and radio in promoting
   breastfeeding.  To determine the campaign's impact on the target
   population, the Caribbean Food and Nutrition Institute (together with
   the Nutrition Unit of the Ministry of Health) interviewed women who
   delivered babies at the Port-of-Spain General Hospital and San Fernanado
   General Hospital in Trinidad during the weeks following the end of the
   campaign during their hospital stay and 4 months later at their homes. 
   Analysis showed the significant effect of frequent mass media exposure
   on knowledge of breastfeeding.  Of the media used, radio broadcasting
   had the most significant effect on the target population (significant at
   the 10% level).  A positive correlation was observed between avoidance
   of bottle feeding before 2 months of age and maternal familiarity with
   the campaign's media message.

   between biomass energy consumption and economic growth in the selected
   10 developing and emerging countries by using the Autoregressive
   Distributed Lag bounds testing (ARDL) approach of cointegration and
   error correction models. It covers annual data from 1980 to 2009. The
   cointegration test results show that there is cointegration between the
   biomass energy consumption and the economic growth in nine of the ten
   countries (Argentina, Bolivia, Cuba, Costa Rica, El Salvador, Jamaica,
   Nicaragua, Panama, Paraguay, Peru). The cointegration test results show
   that there is no cointegration between the biomass energy consumption
   and the economic growth in one of the ten countries (Paraguay). (C) 2012

AB There is a recognized dearth of standard environmental quality data in
   the wider Caribbean area, especially on coral atolls/small island
   states. Extensive surveys of sediment contamination (n = 109 samples) in
   Bermuda revealed a wide spectrum of environmental quality. Zinc and
   especially copper levels were elevated at some locations, associated
   with boating (antifouling paints and boatyard discharges). Mercury
   contamination was surprisingly prevalent, with total levels as high as
   12 mg kg(-1) DW, although methyl mercury levels were quite low. PAH, PCB
   and PCDD/PCDF contamination was detected a several hotspots associated
   with road run-off, a marine landfill, and a former US Naval annexe. NOAA
   sediment quality guidelines were exceeded at several locations,
   indicating biological effects are possible, or at some locations
   probable. Overall, and despite lack of industrialization, anthropogenic
   chemicals in sediments of the atoll presented a risk to benthic
   biodiversity at a number of hotspots suggesting a need for sediment
   management strategies. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB In this abstract, I discuss two recent examples of women's filmmaking in
   Melanesia. The documentaries are Tanah Mama (2014), focused on West
   Papua and Cafe Niugini (2015), set in Papua New Guinea. Both films
   explore and represent food in profoundly different ways. Here, I
   consider their respective depictions of food, demonstrating that Tanah
   Mama represents food as sustenance while Cafe Niugini renders food as
   'cuisine' through the 'creative performance' of cookery. Nevertheless,
   and as I argue, both documentaries reflect the filmmakers' interest in
   representing issues associated with food in the Pacific, including the
   importance of Indigenous access to land, population management, gender
   roles and the impact of changing cultural values on food consumption and
   health.

AB Huon Peninsula, Papua New Guinea, is a tectonically unstable, uplifting
   shoreline ringed by emergent coral terraces. The terraces were formed
   during episodes of rapid sea-level rise when corals constructed large,
   discrete coral platforms that were subsequently uplifted. Uranium series
   ages of four prominent Huon Peninsula last glacial (OIS 3) coral
   terraces coincide with the timing of major North Atlantic climate
   reversals at intervals of 6000-7000 yr between 30000 yr and 60000 yr
   ago. Terrace elevations, when combined with uplift, indicate 10-15-m
   high sea-level excursions at these times. We attribute the growth of the
   terraces directly to sea-level rises arising from ice-calving episodes
   from major North Atlantic ice-sheets and the Antarctic ice-sheet that
   precipitated extremes of cold climate called Heinrich events. These
   periods are associated with major discharges of land-based ice and
   enhanced concentrations of ice-rafted debris in deep-sea cores.
   Sea-levels at this time were 60-90 m lower than present. (C) 2001

PY 1997
AB Geothermal anomalies of different types occur within distinct
   geological/structural settings in Papua New Guinea. According to R.F.
   Heming, geothermal occurrences in Papua New Guinea can be classified
   into two types, those related to vulcanism (Lihir, Rabaul and other
   series of islands along the volcanic are) and those resulting from a
   regional heat flow probably caused by radiogenic sources, for instance
   those in the Wau/Bulolo area. The manifestation of this potential source
   of energy generally coincides with either converging or diverging
   tectonic plate boundaries. Previous inventories on thermal waters were
   carried out by vulcanologists from the Rabaul Observatory in the early
   1960s. However, these studies rarely included chemical analyses of water
   and gas emissions and the investigations were carried out in an ad hoc
   manner, generally as a secondary activity.
   The most recent investigation on thermal waters was conducted on Lihir
   Island in connection with the development of the open pit gold mine.
   These studies included detailed exploratory drilling to a maximum depth
   of 730 m, and a water chemistry isotopic sampling and analysis
   programme. The hydrothermal waters were not considered as an energy
   source but as a hazard during the development stage of the mine.
   Nevertheless, the geothermal anomaly observed at Lihir includes hot
   springs emerging along the coastal zones with temperatures that approach
   100 degrees C, steam, and thermal borehole waters with temperatures that
   exceed 200 degrees C.
   Chemical analysis results of thermal fluids from Rabaul, Talasea and
   other areas in Papua New Guinea generally show high total dissolved
   solids and low pH. In contrast, recent results from the deepest and
   honest thermal source at Lihir shows a neutral pH, a Na-Cl-SO4
   composition and temperatures above 200 degrees C. Despite the
   concentration of chloride being similar to that of sea water, other
   chemical results and stable hydrogen and oxygen isotopic compositions of
   thermal fluids imply the source to be mixture of local meteoric water
   and deep thermal water rather than sea water. Results of geothermal
   modelling suggests that the total geothermal upflow is equivalent to 54
   MW.

AB The Kairuku Formation (Lower Pliocene), Yule Island, Papua New Guinea,
   contains a rich and diverse echinoid fauna. Clypeasteroid (sand dollar)
   echinoids are an important component of this fauna and seven taxa are
   recognised. A seagrass community included the clypeasterids Clypeaster
   reticulatus (Linne), Clypeaster latissimus (Lamarck) and Clypeaster
   humilis (Leske) and the laganid Laganum depressum Lesson in L. Agassiz,
   1841. A current-swept, shallow water, sand-dwelling community included
   Laganum decagonale (de Blainville, 1827), Laganum depressum delicatum
   Mazzetti, 1894 and Laganum depressum sinaiticum Fraas, 1867. Bathymetric
   ranges of extant forms of these clypeasteroids suggest water depths from
   littoral to about 40 m. This diverse fauna has much in common with modem
   communities of the tropical Indo-Pacific, as well as fossil
   Plio-Pleistocene faunas of the Indonesian archipelago and the western
   Indian Ocean region.

AB Total (live + dead) ostacod assemblages are documented in five samples

   Trinidad and east of the Orinoco delta. Although the fields both lie in
   similar to 70-80m of water, and Mahogany lies only 18 km NE of Coconut,
   they are situated in different biofacies: Bradleya ex gr. dictyon, the
   dominant species in the Coconut Field (46% of total recovery), forms
   only 7.6% of the fauna in the Mahogany Field. Assemblages in the
   Mahogany Field are dominated by Bairdoppilata dorsoangulata. Diversity
   (measured using both species richness and the Information Function) is
   greater at the Mahogany Field. This suggests greater water clarity at
   the Mahogany Field, which lies farther from the Orinoco delta.
   Bythoceratina carmoi, Callistocythere fossulata and Bairdoppilata
   dorsoangulata are recorded north of 4 degrees N for the first time.

AB Among the many ecosystem services provided by mangrove ecosystems, their
   role in carbon (C) sequestration and storage is quite high compared to
   other tropical forests. Mangrove forests occupy less than 1 % of
   tropical forested areas but account for approximately 3 % of global
   carbon sequestration by tropical forests. Yet there remain many areas
   where little data on the size and variation of mangrove C stocks exist.
   To address this gap and examine the range of C stocks in mangroves at
   landscape scales, we quantified C stocks of Honduran mangroves along the
   Pacific and Caribbean coasts and the Bay Islands. We also examined
   differences in ecosystem C stocks due to size and structure of mangrove
   vegetation found in Honduras. Ecosystem C stocks ranged from 570 Mg C
   ha(-1) in the Pacific coast to similar to 1000 Mg C ha(-1) in Caribbean
   coast and the Bay Islands. Ecosystem C stocks on the basis of mangrove
   structure were 1200, 800 and 900 Mg C ha(-1), in low, medium and tall
   mangroves, respectively. We did not find significant differences in
   ecosystem C stocks on the basis of location (Pacific coast, Caribbean
   coast and Bay Islands) or mangrove type (low, medium and tall). Mangrove
   soils represented the single largest pool of total C in these
   ecosystems, with 87, 81 and 94 % at the Pacific coast, Caribbean coast
   and the Bay Islands, respectively. While there were no significant
   differences in total ecosystem stocks among mangrove types, there were
   differences in where carbon is stored. Mangrove soils among low, medium
   and tall mangroves contained 99, 93 and 80 % of the total ecosystem C
   stocks. In addition, we found a small yet significant negative
   correlation between vegetation C pools and pore water salinity and pH at
   the sampled sites. Conversion of mangroves into other land use types
   such as aquaculture or agriculture could result in loses of these soil C
   reserves due to mineralization and oxidation. Coupled with their other
   ecosystem services, an understanding of the size of mangrove ecosystem C
   stocks underscores their values in the formulation of conservation and
   climate change mitigation strategies in Central America.

AB Animals often select for habitats that increase their chance of survival
   by balancing the need to acquire food, reproduce and avoid predation.
   Perennial blooms of golden jellyfish (Mastigias papua etpisoni) are
   present in Jellyfish Lake, Palau, a popular tourist destination. Based
   on the species' economic importance and unusual behavioural complexity,
   increased understanding of jellyfish habitat selection is necessary. We
   used a novel approach, a REMUS autonomous underwater vehicle, to
   quantify jellyfish distribution, abundance and habitat, and compared
   these findings to traditional methods. Midday acoustic surveys showed
   jellyfish distribution was patchy and the population resided mainly on
   the eastern side of the lake, as it is known that jellyfish migrate
   eastward towards the sun. Highest vertical densities of jellyfish were
   at 6-7 m, potentially to mitigate UV damage or photoinhibition of their
   photosymbionts, suggesting a coupling exists between their vertical
   distribution and water properties. Abundance estimates of jellyfish were
   similar to 2.75 and similar to 7.1 million (similar to 2 million
   excluding bell diameters <1 cm) from acoustic and net samples,
   suggesting the methodology employed underestimated the population's
   smaller size fraction and non-synoptic surveys could impact estimates
   due to unresolved patchiness. Our approach could investigate population
   dynamics, behaviour or habitat associations on fine scales.

AB To enhance the understanding of larval dispersal in marine organisms,
   species with a sedentary adult stage and a pelagic larval phase of known
   duration constitute ideal candidates, because inferences can be made
   about the role of larval dispersal in population connectivity. Members
   of the immensely diverse marine fauna of the Indo-Malay Archipelago are
   of particular importance in this respect, as biodiversity conservation
   is becoming a large concern in this region. In this study, the genetic
   population structure of the pink anemonefish, Amphiprion perideraion, is
   analyzed by applying 10 microsatellite loci as well as sequences of the
   mitochondrial control region to also allow for a direct comparison of
   marker-derived results. Both marker systems detected a strong overall
   genetic structure (Phi(ST) = 0.096, P < 0.0001; mean D-est = 0.17; F-ST
   = 0.015, P < 0.0001) and best supported regional groupings (Phi(CT) =
   0.199 P < 0.0001; F-CT = 0.018, P < 0.001) that suggested a
   differentiation of the Java Sea population from the rest of the
   archipelago. Differentiation of a New Guinea group was confirmed by both
   markers, but disagreed over the affinity of populations from west New
   Guinea. Mitochondrial data suggest higher connectivity among populations
   with fewer signals of regional substructure than microsatellite data.
   Considering the homogenizing effect of only a few migrants per
   generation on genetic differentiation between populations,
   marker-specific results have important implications for conservation
   efforts concerning this and similar species.

AB The status of chondrichthyan (sharks, batoids and chimaeras)
   conservation in the Indo-Australasian region is examined, and issues
   relevant to the conservation of this fauna at the subregional level
   [Australia, Indonesia (excluding West Papua), New Guinea (West Papua and
   Papua New Guinea), New Caledonia and New Zealand] are discussed.
   According to the 2009 IUCN Red List of Threatened Species, c. 21% of
   Indo-Australasian chondrichthyans are classified as threatened
   (critically endangered, endangered and vulnerable) and c. 40% are of
   conservation concern (threatened and near threatened). The proportion of
   threatened species is highest in New Guinea (c. 39%) and Indonesia (c.
   35%) and least in New Zealand (c. 11%). In New Guinea, three quarters of
   the species are of conservation concern; in Indonesia, nearly two thirds
   are of conservation concern. Within the region, the proportion of
   threatened batoids (c. 29%) is higher than threatened sharks (c. 17%),
   while there are no threatened chimaeras. Conservation status is
   discussed at the order (for sharks), suborder (for batoids) and family
   level. Issues relating to the conservation status of chondrichthyans
   vary greatly between each subregion, but they mostly relate to targeted
   or incidental capture in fisheries. A handful of sharks and batoids are
   protected within Australian waters, while one species is protected in
   New Zealand. Both Australia and New Zealand have developed National
   Plans of Action for the Conservation and Management of Sharks
   (NPOA-Sharks), but these are lacking elsewhere. Development and
   implementation of NPOA-Sharks are a priority in order to drive the
   conservation of the regional fauna. Sustainable fisheries management
   (including by-catch), confronting the challenge of illegal, unreported
   and unregulated fishing, species protection where appropriate and marine
   protected areas (MPA) are all likely to prove vital in ensuring the
   long-term conservation of Indo-Australasian sharks, batoids and
   chimaeras.

AB Objectives: Obesity and hypertension are increasing in Papua New Guinea.
   This study investigated the association of dietary pattern and physical
   activity level with anthropometric measurements and blood pressure in
   migrant Bougainvilleans in the capital city of Port Moresby. Methods:
   Adults who had moved from Naasioi territory on Bougainville Island and
   resided in Port Moresby during the study period were studied (n = 70).
   The International Physical Activity Questionnaire was used to evaluate
   physical activity, and dietary pattern was assessed by per week
   consumption frequency of food items. Results: The least square
   regression analysis revealed that interindividual variation in body mass
   index and waist circumference was explained by variations in physical
   activity but not by dietary pattern. Blood pressure was not associated
   with physical activity level or dietary pattern. Conclusion: The
   individual variation in anthropometric measurements in urban Papua New
   Guinea is mainly influenced by physical activity level. Am. J. Hum.

AB The former Instituto de Investigacao Cientifica Tropical-IICT (Lisbon,
   Portugal), recently integrated into the University of Lisbon, gathers
   important natural history collections from Portuguese-speaking African
   countries. In this study, we describe the bird collection from the
   Democratic Republic of Sao Tome and Principe, which was fully
   taxonomically checked and georeferenced. The IICT bird collection
   contains 5598 specimens, of which 559 are from Sao Tome and Principe,
   representing 85 taxa, including 19 endemic species and 13 endemic
   subspecies of birds. The specimens were collected between 1946 and 1973,
   although 43% of the records are from 1954 and 45% are from 1970. The
   geographic distribution of samples covers the whole territory, with a
   higher number of records from Sao Tome than from Principe. The districts
   with highest number of records are Pague (equivalent to Principe
   Island), and Agua Grande and Me-Zochi on Sao Tomee. Despite the
   relatively low number of specimens per taxon, the importance of the
   collection is considerable due to the high number of endemic and
   threatened species represented. Furthermore, it adds valuable
   information to the GBIF network, especially for a country whose two
   islands are each an Endemic Bird Area and for which substantial gaps in
   ornithological knowledge remain.

AB The extant irregular echinoids Echinoneus cyclostomus Leske and Brissus
   unicolor (Leske) are reported from the middle Pleistocene of Barbados.
   The moderately robust E. cyclostomus is well-preserved, while B.
   unicolor, which had a thin test in life, occurs as an internal mold. The
   holectypoid E. cyclostomus sensu late occurs in fossiliferous deposits
   of Upper Oligocene to Pleistocene age in the Antillean region, showing
   remarkably little overall variation in test shape during this period.
   Similarly, gross morphological features of Recent B. unicolor are not
   dissimilar to those seen in some Caribbean species from the Paleogene,
   such as B. sp. cf. B. unicolor from the Middle Eocene of Jamaica.
   Superior fossil specimens will be required to determine if certain
   fossil species within these genera are valid. This analysis supports the
   observation that many taxa of the modern Antillean, shallow-water
   echinoid fauna have essentially persisted within the region since at
   least the Oligocene.

AB The El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) is the most potent source of
   interannual climate variability. Uncertainty surrounding the impact of
   greenhouse warming on ENSO strength and frequency has stimulated efforts
   to develop a better understanding of the sensitivity of ENSO to climate
   change, Here we use annually banded corals from Papua New Guinea to show
   that ENSO has existed for the past 130,000 years, operating even during
   "glacial" times of substantially reduced regional and global temperature
   and changed solar forcing. However, we also find that during the 20th
   century ENSO has been strong compared with ENSO of previous cool
   (glacial) and warm (interglacial) times. The observed pattern of change
   in amplitude may be due to the combined effects of ENSO dampening during
   cool glacial conditions and ENSO forcing by precessional orbital
   variations.

AB Tobago's fringing coral reefs (FR) and Buccoo Reef Complex (BRC) can be
   affected locally by wastewater and stormwater, and regionally by the
   Orinoco River. In 2001, seasonal effects of these inputs on water-column
   nutrients and phytoplankton (Chl a), macroalgal C:N:P and delta N-15
   values, and biocover at FR and BRC sites were examined. Dissolved
   inorganic nitrogen (DIN, particularly ammonium) increased and soluble
   reactive phosphorus (SRP) decreased from the dry to wet season. Wet
   season satellite and Chl a data showed that Orinoco runoff reaching
   Tobago contained chromophoric dissolved organic matter (CDOM) but little
   Chl a, suggesting minimal riverine nutrient transport to Tobago. C:N
   ratios were lower (16 vs. 21) and macroalgal delta N-15 values higher
   (6.6 parts per thousand vs. 5.5 parts per thousand) in the BRC vs. FR,
   indicating relatively more wastewater N in the BRC. High macroalgae and
   low coral cover in the BRC further indicated that better wastewater
   treatment could improve the health of Tobago's coral reefs. (C) 2009

AB Detailed palaeo- and rock magnetic investigations were carried out on
   two sediment cores from the Tobago Basin, Eastern Caribbean. The 2.8 m
   long profiles span the last 15 kyr, according to accelerator mass
   spectrometry C-14 dates. Global climatic variations marking the
   transition from the Pleistocene into the Holocene are clearly reflected
   in the rock magnetic parameters. Their variations reflect the
   contribution of the coarse-grained fraction to the bulk composition.
   However, fine-grained Ti-magnetite particles carry a fairly stable
   magnetization in sediments deposited in the last 10 kyr. Comparison of
   stacked directional records of characteristic remanent magnetization
   inclination and declination, with data obtained from geomagnetic field
   models revealed distinct similarities for most intervals and add to the
   knowledge about the variability of the geomagnetic field in this area
   poorly covered by experimental data. A stacked record of relative
   palaeointensity was also established, using anhysteretic remanent
   magnetization as normalization parameter. Thus, the intensity of the
   geomagnetic field was steadily decreasing in the Caribbean between 9 and
   0 ka, a trend that does not fit to relative paleointensity records
   available from Northern Hemisphere stacks but matches other low-latitude
   records and the South Atlantic Palaeointensity Stack.

   Angiosperms in 211 genera and 68 families and 51 species of
   Pteridophytes in 31 genera and 18 families are listed from Annobon. The
   most represented families are Leguminosae (38 taxa), Gramineae (29 taxa)
   and Orchidaceae (28 taxa). In addition bibliographic references have
   been collated and checked. Thirty-eight species are included based on
   records from the literature where their distribution ranges suggest they
   should occur on Annobon. Fifty-four introduced species that have become
   naturalized are listed. Twenty-four taxa are recorded for the first
   time, three of which were not previously known for Equatorial Guinea.
   Peperomia blanda is recorded as a new for West Tropical Africa. At
   present 23 taxa are known to be endemic to Annobon or to Annobon and the
   islands of Sao Tome or/and Principe. The percentage of endemic species
   is 7.8. The small area of Annobon and the strict application of
   conservation criteria indicated that every endemic of the island should
   be considered as threatened under IUCN guidelines. Species conservation
   assessments were undertaken for 23 taxa using IUCN criteria; 19 of these

AB Objectives: To develop the methods for assessment of food and nutrient
   intake using standardized food frequency questionnaires (FFQ) in three
   African origin populations from Cameroon, Jamaica and Caribbean migrants
   to the United Kingdom.
   Design: Cross-sectional assessment of diet from a representative sample
   in each site, using either a 2-day food diary or a 24-h recall method to
   determine foods for inclusion on the food frequency questionnaire.
   Setting: A rural and urban site in Cameroon, Evodoula and Cite Verte in
   Yaounde, respectively; a district in Kingston Jamaica;
   African-Caribbeans living in central Manchester, UK.
   Subjects: Aged 25-79 years, 61 from the Cameroonian urban site, 62 from
   the village site; 102 subjects from Jamaica (additional analysis on a
   subsample of 20): 29 subjects from Manchester, UK.
   Main outcome measures: Foods contributing to nutrients in each site to
   allow the development of a FFQ.
   Results: A high response rate was obtained in each site. Comparison of
   macronutrient intakes between the sites showed that carbohydrate was the
   most important contributor to energy intake in Jamaica (55%) and the
   least in rural Cameroon. In rural Cameroon, fat (mainly palm oil) was
   the most important contributor to energy intake (44%). Manchester had
   the highest contribution of protein to energy (17%). Foods contributing
   to total energy, protein, fat and carbohydrate were determined. In rural
   Cameroon, the top 10 food items contributed 66% of the total energy
   intake compared to 37% for the top 10 foods in Manchester. Foods
   contributing to energy were similar in Jamaica and Manchester. Cassava
   contributed 44% of the carbohydrate intake in rural Cameroon and only 6%
   in urban Cameroon. One FFQ has been developed for use in both sites in
   Cameroon containing 76 food items. The FFQ for Jamaica contains 69 foods
   and for Manchester 108 food items.
   Conclusion: Considerable variations exist within sites (Cameroon) and
   between sites in foods which are important contributors to nutrient
   intakes. With careful exploration of eating habits it has been possible
   to develop standardized, but locally appropriate FFQs for use in African
   populations in different countries.

AB It has been suggested that boron deficiency in food may be a cause of
   some arthritis (Newnham 1979). Epidemiological studies were done to try
   to ascertain why some countries have more or less arthritis than other
   countries. Jamaica, Mauritius, Fiji and Israel were visited with a view
   to ascertaining the boron levels of locally consumed food as it was
   suspected that excessive use of soluble chemical fertilizers had damaged
   the soils of the sugar producing lands. Food grown on these soils were
   found to have low boron levels. By contrast the foods consumed in Israel
   had high boron concentrations associated with a low incidence of
   arthritis. South African work has shown that people who eat mostly maize
   have more arthritis when eating processed maize grown with fertilizer.
   Brief reference is made to the role of boron in human diets. There are
   bound to be geographical differences in dietary boron, but even in the
   USA levels have dropped considerably in 50 years. Arthritis is
   increasing, especially juvenile arthritis. The increased use of
   fertilizers and genetic selection of plants has led to a wide range of
   changes in the quality of foodstuffs and their nutrient content. The
   identification of the parallel loss of boron may reflect vital changes
   in trace elements and other nutrients.

AB There are many studies as for the maritime territorial disputes in the

   the maritime boundary delimitation including the exclusive economic
   zone/continental shelf. Although this paper will be referred to them in
   the sense that it covers the entire Asian Pacific Rim, it focuses on
   maritime territorial disputes in the Pacific waters, which have not
   received much attention from academia and media. First, the paper will
   examine how the countries in the Pacific Ocean was and are in the
   process of dispute and settlement of the coastal islands claims and how
   they address the maritime boundary delimitation issues in the exclusive
   economic zone, particularly the continental shelf. Next, the paper will
   address two specific case studies, focusing on the peculiarities of the
   problem of coastal island belonging - land and maritime characteristics
   - and implications for the settlement of East China Sea and the South
   China Sea maritime territorial disputes. The first case is the
   territorial dispute between Australia and Papua New Guinea for the
   sovereignty of the islands in Torres Strait. The second case is the
   territorial dispute between New Caledonia (France) and Vanuatu over
   Matthew and Hunter Island.

AB The distribution of the poorly known Fraser's dolphin Lagenodelphis
   hosei Fraser (Sarawak Mus J 7:478-503, 1956), is revised for the
   northern Atlantic (NA), with new records for temperate and subtropical
   oceanic islands. Fraser's dolphins are reported for the first time in
   the Azores, from a pod of approximately 50 individuals observed in
   August 2008, and for the Madeira Archipelago, where a pod of circa 80
   individuals is described from opportunistic observations in August 2010.
   Observations in the Azores occurred during a period of regional increase
   in seawater temperature (23.5 A degrees C; > 1 A degrees C for circa 15
   days), revealing the species potential as a bio-indicator of climate
   change. The occurrence of Fraser's dolphins in the NA is characterized
   by an equally small number of stranding events and sightings at sea
   which have been accumulating since 1972. A compilation of 47 occurrences
   from publications, reports and online databases (plus one report with
   123 sightings in the Lesser Antilles), was used to comment on the
   species ecology in the region. Stranding events are often of a single
   specimen, occurring on both western and eastern margins. Sightings at
   sea are scattered throughout the NA, with most observations from the
   Gulf of Mexico, and the Caribbean Sea, where year-round sightings have
   been reported in the Lesser Antilles (off Guadeloupe). Observations are
   mostly confined to open waters over 200-2,200 m depth areas, approaching
   the coasts of oceanic islands. Pod sizes vary between 50 and 80 in the
   Caribbean Sea, with smaller pods observed in the Gulf of Mexico (15-30),
   only rarely exceeding 100 individuals per group (20 %, n = 5), in
   contrast to large aggregations reported in the Pacific. Captures have
   been reported from St. Vincent (Lesser Antilles) and more recently from
   Ghana. Mixed-species groups have been observed, such as with
   Peponocephala electra and Globicephala macrorhynchus. Knowledge of
   Fraser's dolphin ecology in the NA is expected to grow with increasing
   surveys in the Caribbean area and tropical latitudes. Reports on the
   species occurrence, such as data from opportunistic platforms, should
   continue to reach the scientific community, including with associated
   environmental data.

AB Periplatform surface sediments were studied for carbonate mineralogy in
   conjunction with analyses of the water column for carbonate chemistry on
   the eastern Northern Nicaragua Rise (NNR) in the Caribbean Sea.  The
   results show a strong correspondence between variations and
   disappearance, with increasing water depth, of metastable carbonate
   minerals (fine aragonite and magnesian calcite) and their respective
   saturation levels in the overlying waters.  Similar correspondence
   between variations in sediment proportions of fine aragonite and
   magnesian calcite and their respective saturation levels has previously
   been established in the Bahamas.  There are, however, significant
   differences between the two areas.  The sharp decrease in aragonite
   content and the measured aragonite saturation level occur at 4000 m in
   the Bahamas, compared to 1800 m on the eastern NNR.  In both areas,
   magnesian calcite minima correspond to the in situ PCO2 maxima in the
   water column.  The magnesian calcite minimum, however, is at 950 m in
   the Bahamas and 750 m on the eastern NNR.  Magnesian calcite disappears
   in the Bahamas at 3800 m and at 2000 m on the eastern NNR.  These
   results demonstrate the importance of the influence of overlying water
   chemistry on the preservation of metastable carbonate minerals in
   off-bank periplatform sediments, and they clearly demonstrate the
   difference in terms of carbonate preservation between the poorly
   ventilated waters of the Caribbean Sea and the well-oxygenated waters of
   the adjacent Atlantic Ocean.  They also open the possibility of
   obtaining paleoceanographic information on the depth of the CO2 maximum
   (O2 minimum) and its separation from the aragonite saturation depth in
   at least some areas.

AB The sea urchin Diadema antillarum increases the relative size of
   Aristotle's lantern (length of demipyramid) when food limited. This
   provides a tool for investigating algal abundance and biotic
   interactions in the past. A field collection of D. antillarum provided a
   baseline relationship between demipyramid length and body size (test
   diameter). Experimental manipulations of food availability and
   population density resulted in shifts in relative demipyramid length.
   The baseline and experimental data provide a range of responses that was
   compared to museum specimens collected over the past 100 yr from 30
   locations in the Caribbean. The relative demipyramid lengths from the
   museum specimens were also compared over time, and with human population
   density, human fishing pressure, and geographic region. The results
   indicate that relative demipyramid size is indirectly influenced by
   human activity and varies with geographic region. This suggests that
   human fishing pressure has influenced Caribbean coral reef community
   structure by affecting predator-herbivore relationships. However, this
   human impact may be small relative to naturally occurring variation in
   demipyramid size.

AB Purpose Climate change poses diverse, often fundamental, challenges to
   livelihoods of island peoples. The purpose of this study is to
   demonstrate that these challenges must be better understood before
   effective and sustainable adaptation is possible.
   Design/methodology/approach Understanding past livelihood impacts from
   climate change can help design and operationalize future interventions.
   In addition, globalization has had uneven effects on island
   countries/jurisdictions, producing situations especially in
   archipelagoes where there are significant differences between core and
   peripheral communities. This approach overcomes the problems that have
   characterized many recent interventions for climate-change adaptation in
   island contexts which have resulted in uneven and at best only marginal
   livelihood improvements in preparedness for future climate change.
   Findings Island contexts have a range of unique vulnerability and
   resilience characteristics that help explain recent and proposed
   responses to climate change. These include the sensitivity of coastal
   fringes to climate-environmental changes: and in island societies, the
   comparatively high degrees of social coherence, closeness to nature and
   spirituality that are uncommon in western contexts.
   Research limitations/implications Enhanced understanding of island
   environmental and social contexts, as well as insights from past climate
   impacts and peripherality, all contribute to more effective and
   sustainable future interventions for adaptation.
   Originality/value The need for more effective and sustainable adaptation
   in island contexts is becoming ever more exigent as the pace of
   twenty-first-century climate change increases.

AB Iceland and Trinidad and Tobago are small open, high-income island
   economies with very specific resource-use patterns. This article
   presents a material flow analysis (MFA) for the two countries covering a
   time period of nearly five decades. Both countries have a narrow
   domestic resource base, their economy being largely based on the
   exploitation of one or two key resources for export production. In the
   case of Trinidad and Tobago, the physical economy is dominated by oil
   and natural gas extraction and petrochemical industries, whereas
   Iceland's economy for centuries has been based on fisheries. More
   recently, abundant hydropower and geothermal heat were the basis for the
   establishment of large export-oriented metal processing industries,
   which fully depend on imported raw materials and make use of domestic
   renewable electricity. Both countries are highly dependent on these
   natural resources and vulnerable to overexploitation and price
   developments. We show how the export-oriented industries lead to high
   and growing levels of per capita material and energy use and carbon
   dioxide emissions resulting from large amounts of processing wastes and
   energy consumption in production processes. The example of small open
   economies with an industrial production system focused on few, but
   abundant, key resources and of comparatively low complexity provides
   interesting insights of how resource endowment paired with availability
   or absence of infrastructure and specific institutional arrangements
   drives domestic resource-use patterns. This also contributes to a better
   understanding and interpretation of MFA indicators, such as domestic
   material consumption.

AB In this article, I analyze the implementation and management of Crooked
   Tree Wildlife Sanctuary in rural Creole (Afro-Caribbean) Belize as a
   process of creolization. Encounters between different villagers,
   Belizean and international conservationists, and government officials in
   creating and running the sanctuary generated both synthesis and
   disjuncture in the conservation policy and practice that emerged.
   Differently positioned actors shifted their claims depending on context,
   reflecting the ambivalence that characterizes rural Creole culture, to
   further their interests as they created conservation in Belize. I use
   the metaphor of creolization to capture the ambivalence of subjects as
   they adopt varying and, sometimes, contradictory positions in fields of
   uneven relations of power. The metaphor shows how temporary syntheses
   emerge out of the encounters between these subjects. My analysis thus
   reveals how "local" peoples, often imagined as pawns in global
   processes, can be creative agents in the generation of global forms

AB Wind energy has been explored as a viable alternative to fossil fuels in
   many small island developing states such as those in the Caribbean for a
   long time. Central to evaluating the feasibility of any wind energy
   project is choosing the most appropriate wind speed model. This is a
   function of the metric used to assess the goodness of fit of the
   statistical models tested. This paper compares a number of common
   metrics then proposes an alternative to the application-blind
   statistical tools commonly used.Wind speeds at two locations are
   considered: Crown Point, Tobago; and Piarco, Trinidad. Hourly wind
   speeds over a 15-year period have been analyzed for both sites. The
   available data is modelled using the Birnbaum-Saunders, Exponential,
   Gamma, Generalized Extreme Value, Generalized Pareto, Nakagami, Normal,
   Rayleigh and Weibull probability distributions. The distributions were
   compared graphically and their parameters were estimated using maximum
   likelihood estimation. Goodness of fit was assessed using the normalised
   mean square error testing, Chi-squared testing, Kolmogorov-Smirnov,
   R-squared, Akaike information criteria and Bayesian information criteria
   tests and the distributions ranked. The distribution ranking varied
   widely depending on the test used highlighting the need for a more
   contextualized goodness of fit metric. With this in mind, the concept of
   application-specific information criteria (ASIC) for testing goodness of
   fit is introduced. This allows distributions to be ranked by secondary
   features which are a function of both the primary data and the
   application space.

AB Papua New Guinea (PNG) is an extensively forested country. Recent
   research suggests that despite commencing a trajectory of deforestation
   and degradation later than many counties in the Asia-Pacific region, PNG
   is now undergoing comparable rates of forest change. Here we explore the
   bioregional distribution of changes in the forest estate over the period
   1972-2002 and examine their implications for forest protection. This is
   undertaken through the development of a novel bioregional classification
   of the country based on biogeographic regions and climatic zones, and
   its application to existing forest cover and forest-cover change data.
   We found that degradation and deforestation varied considerably across
   the 11 defined biogeographic regions. We report that the majority of
   deforestation and degradation has occurred within all the lowland
   forests, and that it is these forests that have the greatest potential
   for further losses in the near term. The largest percentage of total
   change occurred in the east of PNG, in the islands and lowlands of the
   Bismarck, D'Entrecasteaux, East Papuan Islands and in the South-East
   Papua-Oro region. The only region with a significant highlands component
   to undergo deforestation at a comparable magnitude to the islands and
   lowland regions was the Huon Peninsula and Adelbert region. Significant
   changes have also occurred at higher elevations, especially at the
   interface of subalpine grasslands and upper montane forests. Lower
   montane forests have experienced proportionally less change, yet it is
   these forests that constitute the majority of forests enclosed within
   the protected area system. We find that protected areas are not
   convincingly protecting either representative areas of PNG's ecosystems,
   nor the forests within their borders. We conclude by suggesting a more
   expansive and integrated approach to managing the national forest
   estate.

AB There is an increasing recognition that marine and coastal ecosystems
   are under severe threat. The implementation of Marine Protected Areas
   (MPAs) has become a cornerstone in addressing these impacts. The
   formulation of the Aichi Target (AT) 11 has acknowledged the benefits of
   MPAs as a vital approach to achieve marine conservation targets. In the
   AT 11, reference to the term "equitably managed" has demonstrated the
   importance of equity in the planning and management of MPAs and in this
   paper, a description of how equity should be considered from the
   inception stage is detailed. Two case studies, one in Japan and the
   other in the Solomon Islands, were chosen because they include equity
   considerations from the inception and were successful in reaching their
   conservation targets. Through these two case studies, it is demonstrated
   that understanding the objectives and expectations of all stakeholders
   can help achieve the qualitative goals of the AT 11. This is
   particularly true for local and indigenous communities in Small Island
   Developing States (SIDS) and coastal communities in developing
   countries. Finally, a set of recommendations has been provided to
   address possible limitations that could arise during the MPA design
   exercise. Participatory area management and spatial and temporal zoning
   can help by ensuring that benefits and costs are distributed equitably
   between stakeholders. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB An understanding of the climatic controls on precipitation delta O-18 is
   required to interpret isotopic records of paleoclimate and
   paleoaltimetry. However, variations in precipitation delta O-18 in time
   and space are only poorly known in northern Central America. To test the
   hypothesis that precipitation and surface water delta O-18 values are
   dominated by temporal and spatial amount effects, we analyzed delta O-18
   in surface waters collected from Guatemala and Belize, and in
   precipitation from the Global Network for Isotopes in Precipitation
   database for Veracruz, Mexico, and San Salvador, El Salvador. Herein we
   show that the dominant controls on delta O-18 values of precipitation
   and surface waters are fairly simple. Temporally, the dominant control
   on precipitation delta O-18 values is the amount effect, whereby there
   is an inverse correlation between rainfall amount and delta O-18.
   Precipitation delta O-18 values decrease by 1.24%omicron per 100 mm
   increase of monthly rainfall. Spatially. only two variables - distance
   from the coast and mean catchment altitude - explain 84% of the surface
   water delta O-18 variability. Surface water delta O-18 values show an
   altitude effect of -1.9 to -2.4%omicron km(-1) and a continental effect
   of 0.69%omicron per 100 km once corrected for altitude effects. A
   decrease in surface water delta O-18 by 3 to 4%omicron from the
   Caribbean Sea to the Pacific Ocean is evident as an isotopic rain shadow
   on the Pacific slope. Our data also show that river waters in this humid
   tropical environment are good proxies for delta O-18 values of
   precipitation in northern Central America. The Guatemala/Belize surface
   water line is defined as delta D = 8.0 x delta O-18+8.7, which is
   similar to the meteoric water line at San Salvador of delta D = 8.1 x
   delta O-18 +10.9. Spatial variability in delta O-18 values is
   interpreted to reflect 1) progressive rainout of Caribbean-sourced air
   masses upon traverse of Central America, and 2) the
   temperature-dependent equilibrium fractionation between vapor and
   condensate related to the altitude effect. The data show that the
   northeast trade winds are the dominant moisture source to Central
   America, mixing with Pacific-derived moisture west of the cordilleran
   divide. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Human breastfeeding is a biocultural process shaped by the interaction
   of numerous biological, cultural, economic, and social factors. Although
   previous studies have found that a society's subsistence economy alone
   does not determine weaning timing, subsistence may still have a profound
   effect on weaning food choices. This paper analyses nitrogen and carbon
   stable isotopes in bone collagen and apatite of individuals from six
   precolonial Caribbean sites grouped into four subsistence categories:
   Hunter-Fisher-Gatherers (Cueva del Perico I and Cueva Calero, Cuba),
   Horticulturalists (Canimar Abajo, Cuba), Agriculturalists from the
   Antilles (Paso del Indio, Puerto Rico), and Agriculturalists of
   Mesoamerica (Marco Gonzalez and San Pedro, Belize) in order to explore
   how subsistence economy affected the different groups' breastfeeding and
   weaning practices. Ages for the start and the end of weaning, and the
   isotopic characteristics of possible food sources used as supplements
   during the weaning process, were assessed using the Bayesian probability
   model Weaning Age Reconstruction with Nitrogen isotopes. Model results
   indicate (a) a major dietary change around 2years of age for most of the
   study populations, (b) that supplements seem to have been introduced
   into nonadults diet at earlier ages than has been observed in
   ethnographic populations of the area, (c) no direct correlation between
   the start of weaning and the availability of cultigens, but (d) that
   groups that had access to cultigens would appear to have weaned their
   children using foods with lower nitrogen isotope values, suggesting that
   plants (likely domesticates) may have had an important role as weaning
   foods.

AB Although polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) arc toxic pollutants
   for which some are known carcinogens, there is limited information on
   the cancer risk such substances pose to the population via marine
   sediments, despite a significant part of the world's food supply being
   derived from the coastal environment. This study was conducted in a
   heavily industrialized and urbanized coastal area, in Trinidad. PAHs
   were quantified in sediments during the dry and wet seasons and were
   observed to be significantly higher in the wet season compared to the
   dry season. Also emerging from this study is that PAH levels were lower,
   in the areas where natural gas is the dominant energy source for
   industries, compared with those areas where crude oil-based fossil fuel
   is predominantly used. Perylene levels were demonstrated to be of
   biogenic origin near the protected wetland area. It was observed that
   nearshore sediment PAHs concentrations were higher than offshore levels.
   The sources of PAHs, identified by Positive Matrix Factorization (PMF)
   in the marine sediments, were vehicular combustion of gasoline and
   diesel, biomass burning, industrial combustion and oil spills. The mean
   Incremental Lifetime Cancer Risks (ILCR) due to fish consumption from
   this region during the dry and wet seasons was >1 x 10(-4), indicating a
   high cancer risk to the human population. The annual non-cancer risk
   (HQ) was high >1 at the 90th percentile level with an adverse risk lo
   about. 14% of the population. These results can be utilized for
   developing an effective environmental management policy for coastal
   areas in Trinidad and the wider Caribbean region, given that much of the
   islands populations depend on the coastal regions for seafood. In
   addition, these results may assist in boosting current efforts of
   policymakers, towards phasing out crude oil-based fossil fuels for
   cleaner energy sources, such as compressed natural gas. (C) 2019

AB An association analysis among areas of butterfly endemism in the West

   Parsimony analysis of endemicity (PAE), Principal Components Analysis
   (PCA) and Panbiogeography. PAE and PCA's results yielded three main
   associations: Cuba-Bahamas (BAH)-Isle of Pines (PIN)-Cayman Islands
   (CAY), Hispaniola (HIS), Puerto Rico (PRI)-Jamaica (JAM) - Virgin
   Islands (VIR), and Leeward and Winward islands (LEE-WIN).
   Panbiogeography produced the following generalized tracks: Cuba-BAIL
   Cuba-PIN, Cuba-HIS, Cuba-CAY, Cuba-HIS-BAH, Cuba-HIS-PRI, HIS-PRI,
   HIS-JAM, Cuba-HIS-JAM-PRI and LEE-WIN. Cuba is the "mass center" of
   shared species and HIS the "mass center" of endemism. It was considered
   that both islands represent "biogeographic attractors" in the complex
   Antillean scenario. Panbiogeographic analysis produced results more in
   agreement with the real complexity and reticulation of spatial
   relationships among areas.

AB It is accepted that if fisheries resources are to remain renewable and
   able to sustain livelihoods, appropriate management practices must be
   implemented. Even while fisheries management grapples to resolve
   single-species issues, the biological and economic interactions among
   species mandate that to be effective, management techniques must be
   based on more interactive and aggregate-level analyses. In order to
   implement these techniques, the actual links, and the potential impact
   of these links, among the fisheries must be established. Vector
   autoregression (VAR) analysis has the potential to play an increasingly
   important role in ecosystem modelling for fisheries management. This
   study uses VAR analysis to demonstrate the quantitative impact of
   certain ecosystem changes on the productivity of the carite, honey
   shrimp and croaker fisheries of the Gulf of Paria, Trinidad, in the
   particular context of the ecosystem dynamics of trophic linkages,
   bycatch and multispecies fisheries. Four VAR models are constructed to
   investigate the extent to which these factors affect the production of
   the selected fisheries, and to evaluate the management implications of
   these linkages. The empirical analysis is further evidence that, if
   sustainable management of fishery resources is to be achieved,
   management practices based on more multispecies, ecosystem approaches
   must replace the traditional, single-species management techniques. (c)

AB Since 2011, the small South Pacific atoll nation of Tuvalu has been
   affected by algal blooms, the most recent being a large growth of the
   brown alga Sargassum on the main atoll of Funafuti. The gravity of the
   situation led to an invitation to the authors from the Tuvalu Government
   to conduct an initial survey of the problem in November 2013. The bloom
   was seen to be localized on the lagoon side of the main populated island
   of Fongafale, distributed in a variably dense belt up to 100 m from the
   shoreline. A total of 19 species of macroalgae were found in the survey
   area, the dominant one being the phaeophyceaen alga, Sargassum
   polycystum C. Agardh, with individual plants reaching up to 2 m in
   length with a cover ranging between 16 and 23 % of the substratum. For
   seven transects laid from the southern tip of the island to the end of
   the populated area, wet biomass ranged between 0.45 and 3.56 kg m(-2),
   with an average of 1.68 kg m(-2). There was a correlation noticed
   between the density of human population on the shore and algal biomass,
   with the highest biomass figures opposite a school and a hotel. Water
   quality tests also showed nutrient levels almost twice as high in front
   of populated areas than in unpopulated areas of the island. The algal
   belt was seen to be concentrated in water less than 1 m deep, becoming
   sparser as depth increased. The high amount of Sargassum biomass
   available makes it a good candidate for use as a fertiliser additive for
   agricultural practices in Tuvalu. Benefits from seaweed-based
   fertilisers are numerous, and individual farmers have already reported
   success with the blooms species on the atoll. Additionally, the
   Sargassum biomass could be converted into biogas using the process of
   anaerobic digestion in simple household digesters, to meet the need for
   renewable energy in lighting and cooking.

AB As a consequence of the U.S. Atomic Weapons Testing Program in the Trust
   Territory of the Pacific, now the Republic of the Marshall Islands,
   numerous scientists have advised the Marshallese on matters of radiation
   and radioactive contamination, Some of the previous advice has appeared
   to vary or conflict resulting in consequent uncertainty for the people,
   In a new initiative in 1989, the RMI Government engaged a five member
   multi-disciplinary Scientific Advisory Panel to oversee the assessment
   of, and to advise on, the radiological status of the entire nation, The
   formation of the Panel was accompanied by the establishment of a
   Resident Scientist position, and ultimately a small scientific team and
   laboratory on Majuro. The nationwide radiological study was conducted
   using ground survey methods over the period 1990-1994, Tasks undertaken
   by the Panel included formulating reasonable objectives for the study
   and attempting to establish effective communication and understanding of
   issues with political leaders and RMI Government agencies and people, as
   well as advising on and monitoring the scientific integrity of the study
   itself, The attempt was also made to initiate investigations to address
   matters of concern that emerged, The problem was faced of providing not
   only technical guidance on radioactivity and radiation measurements, but
   also explaining the significance of measured values and concepts, such
   as risk and probability of health effects to a diverse but nontechnical
   audience, generally across cultural and language barriers. The
   experience of the Panel in providing advice and guidance to the Republic
   of the Marshall Islands, while unique in many ways, parallels the
   difficulties experienced elsewhere in communicating information about
   risks from radiation exposure.

   during the Holocene. Conceptually, practices represent the nexus of
   human-environment interactions, as well as of structure-agency
   relationships, while methodologically, they are the visible remains -
   whether encountered directly through archaeology, or inferred through
   palaeoenvironmental proxy - of people living in the past.
   Multidisciplinary information from the Upper Wahgi valley is used to
   reconstruct multilayered practices of plant exploitation across the
   landscape through time; the intention is to spatialize, temporalize and
   humanize information often represented chronologically and technically.
   Practice-oriented interpretations clarify, interrogate and amplify
   existing multidisciplinary records of the past and shed new light on how
   the earliest agriculture was originated and transformed in the New

AB This paper analyzes the physical factors controlling the recent
   morphology of major deltas along the Pacific and Caribbean coasts of
   Colombia. The study considers the fluvial, coastal, and oceanographic
   contributions to changes in delta morphology and uses different
   approaches, including (1) remote sensing techniques; (2) time series
   analysis of river discharge, sea level, wave climate and tidal
   variability; (3) analysis of the relationship between monthly mean sea
   level anomalies near the deltas related to the El Nino Southern
   Oscillation (ENSO); (4) development of a database of key physical
   variables; (5) series of correlation calculations to examine which
   environmental factors control delta morphology; (6) analysis of
   shoreline changes for the 1986-2000 yr-period; and (7) classification of
   each delta system based on the relationship between water and sediment
   discharges and wave and tidal energies. Overall, Colombian deltas are
   built under destructive physical conditions. The Pacific deltas, San
   Juan, Mira, and Patia, are tide-influenced deltas although they exhibit
   definite characteristics of wave-dominated systems such as the presence
   of barriers and beach ridges. Also, these deltas exhibit the highest
   marine energy conditions of all Colombian deltas (marine power values
   between 9.1 and 11.6) due to the interplay of (1) moderate wave
   conditions as a result of the effect of swells from the SW with a
   significant height varying from 1.7 in the San Juan delta to 3.0 m and
   3.1 m in the Mira and Patia deltas, respectively; (2) meso-tidal ranges;
   (3) steep subaqueous profiles; (4) low attenuation indexes of deep-water
   waves; and (5) strong oceanographic manifestations associated with the
   ENSO, causing regional sea level rises of 20-44 cm during El Nino
   events. The Caribbean deltas, Magdalena, Sinu and to a lesser extent,
   the Atrato, are wave-influenced deltas. The Magdalena, with deep and
   nearshore wave power values of 45 x 10(6) erg s(-1) and 35 x 10(6) erg
   s(-1) , respectively, and the lowest attenuation index of deep-water
   waves, is the most wave-influenced delta of Colombia. Statistical
   relationships show that the area of Colombian deltas is best predicted
   from average discharge and bank-full width of river entering the delta.
   The number of distributary channels is explained by the marine power
   index and the gradient of the delta plain. The average and total width
   of distributary channels are largely controlled by the tidal range.
   Further analysis of shoreline changes indicate that the retreating
   behavior of the western part of the Magdalena delta has been due to
   anthropogenic causes, including the construction of jetties in 1936. By
   contrast, processes of rapid erosion in the San Juan delta have been the
   result of 2.6 mm yr(-1) long-term relative sea level rise due to
   tectonic induced subsidence coupled with a eustatic rise of sea level.
   Overall, the other deltas are experiencing prograding phases with rates
   of accretion of 100 m yr(-1) in the artificial delta of the Canal del
   Dique. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The Asian toad, Duttaphrynus melanostictus (Schneider, 1799), is
   widespread throughout tropical Asia and very abundant where it occurs.
   It was relatively recently introduced to Timor, the second largest
   island in the biogeographic region called Wallacea. Timor Island shows
   an exceptionally high level of endemismin a wide range of faunal groups
   and there are concerns that D. melanostictus may have a negative impact
   on this diversity, including vertebrates, through direct predation. To
   evaluate the impact the diet of D. melanostictus might have on the local
   fauna, gut contents of 83 preserved toad specimens from five habitat
   types in Timor-Leste, a country occupying the eastern half of Timor
   Island, were examined. We identified 5581 prey items, comprising the
   following animal groups: annelids; snails and slugs; spiders and
   harvestmen; woodlice; millipedes and centipedes; grasshoppers, crickets
   and earwigs; termites; thrips and true bugs; beetles; ants;
   hymenopterans other than ants; true flies; butterflies; unidentified
   insects; and insect larvae. Small eusocial insects (ants and termites)
   constituted the major part of the diet (61.6% and 23.4%, respectively).
   No vertebrate prey was recorded. Prey item composition did not differ
   between habitats. The wide prey spectrum well indicates that D.
   melanostictus is a generalist invertebrate feeder, as other studies,
   from regions where this species occurs naturally, have already shown.
   Although the Asian toad seems to not generally prey on vertebrates,
   vertebrate species that are morphologically similar to invertebrates in
   their overall appearance may be consumed. Hence, a negative effect on
   some taxa (e.g. blindsnakes) may be possible. We also present some
   limited data on intestinal parasites occurring in D. melanostictus.

   The model reveals that factors such as the type of crops grown, group
   membership, farmers' educational level, access to credit, gender,
   contact with extension services or any institution, type of soils,
   income level, participation in soil testing program and farm size affect
   the amount to be paid for soil testing services. These results imply
   that the training module on soil testing and financial support in form

AB Through the removal of parasites, dead skin and mucus from the bodies of
   visiting reef fish (clients), cleaner fish have a significant ecosystem
   function in the ecology of coral reefs. Cleaners gain nutrition from
   these interactions and through offering a 'service' are afforded
   protection from predators. Given these benefits, it is unclear why more
   fish do not engage in cleaning, and why part-time cleaning strategies
   exist. On coral reefs, dedicated species clean throughout their life,
   whereas some species are facultative, employing opportunistic and/or
   temporary cleaning strategies. Here, we investigate the cleaning
   behaviour of a facultative species to assess the relative importance of
   this interaction to the cleaner. Using a combination of focal and event
   sampling from a coral reef in Tobago, we show that cleaning is not an
   essential food source for facultative juvenile blue-headed wrasse
   (Thalassoma bifasciatum), as cleaning rate was unrelated to their
   foraging rate on the substrate. These wrasse displayed two cleaning
   strategies: stationary versus wandering cleaning, with cleaning
   frequency being highest for stationary cleaners. A specific cleaning
   location facilitated increased cleaning frequency, and wrasse cleaning
   rate decreased as cleaner or client abundance increased. We also
   compared juvenile blue-headed wrasse cleaning behaviour to a resident
   dedicated cleaner, the sharknose goby (Elacatinus evelynae), and showed
   that, in comparison, juvenile wrasse clean a narrower client range,
   predominately cleaning three species of gregarious free-ranging
   surgeonfish (Acanthurus spp.). The wrasse, however, frequently
   approached these clients without cleaning, which suggests that their
   selective cleaning strategy may be driven by the acquisition of a
   particular parasitic food source. Juvenile blue-headed wrasse are
   generalist foragers, and may thus be limited in their cleaning behaviour
   by their nutritional requirements, the availability of a suitable
   cleaning site, and fish density, which ultimately means that they do not
   adopt more dedicated cleaning roles within the reef community.

AB We tested the hypothesis for several Caribbean reef fish species that
   there is no difference in nursery function among mangrove, seagrass and
   shallow reef habitat as measured by: (a) patterns of juvenile and adult
   density, (b) assemblage composition, and (c) relative predation rates.
   Results indicated that although some mangrove and seagrass sites showed
   characteristics of nursery habitats, this pattern was weak. While almost
   half of our mangrove and seagrass sites appeared to hold higher
   proportions of juvenile fish (all species pooled) than did reef sites,
   this pattern was significant in only two cases. In addition, only four
   of the six most abundant and commercially important species (Haemulon
   flavolineatum, Haemulon sciurus, Lutjanus apodus, Lutjanus mahogoni,
   Scarus iserti, and Sparisoma aurofrenatum) showed patterns of higher
   proportions of juvenile fish in mangrove and/or seagrass habitat(s)
   relative to coral reefs, and were limited to four of nine sites. Faunal
   similarity between reef and either mangrove or seagrass habitats was
   low, suggesting little, if any exchange between them. Finally, although
   relative risk of predation was lower in mangrove/seagrass than in reef
   habitats, variance in rates was substantial suggesting that not all
   mangrove/seagrass habitats function equivalently. Specifically, relative
   risk varied between morning and afternoon, and between sites of similar
   habitat, yet varied little, in some cases, between habitats
   (mangrove/seagrass vs. coral reefs). Consequently, our results caution
   against generalizations that all mangrove and seagrass habitats have
   nursery function.

   and Tobago (T&T) between March 1998 and May 1999 to determine the
   etiology, sources, and risk factors for Salmonella enteritidis (SE)
   infection. SE infection in T&T was found to be associated with the
   consumption of shell eggs, and in particular raw or undercooked eggs. SE
   isolates from 30 (88%) of 34 patients and from 9 implicated egg or

   cream, cake batter, and egg-containing beverages were the main raw
   egg-containing foods, reflecting the cultural practices of the people of
   T&T. Public health education on the risks of eating raw or undercooked
   eggs, thorough cooking of all egg dishes, and refrigeration of shell
   eggs and egg dishes; studies tracing infected eggs to their sources; and
   testing of flocks of layer chickens for SE are needed to reduce the

AB The New World genus Ogcocephalus comprises 12 spp. Two species are
   island endemics in the eastern Pacific, O. darwini Hubbs in the
   Galapagos archipelago and O. porrectus Garman off Cocos Island, but the
   remaining 10 are western Atlantic species. Five of the Atlantic species
   are described as new: O. pantostictus and O. declivirostris from the
   northern and western Gulf of Mexico, O. rostellum from the Atlantic
   coast of the southeastern USA, O. corniger also from the Atlantic coast
   of the southeastern USA but ranging into the eastern Gulf of Mexico and
   O. pumilus from the Caribbean and coasts of the Guianas. O. parvus
   Longley and Hildebrand has a wider range than formerly known, from the
   coast of the southeastern USA and eastern Gulf of Mexico through the
   Caribbean to the Atlantic coast of South America. O. vespertilio
   (Linnaeus) has a more restricted range than formerly thought, the coast
   of Brazil from the mouth of the Amazon to the mouth of the Rio de la
   Plata. O. notatus (Cuvier and Valenciennes) also has a southerly
   distribution in the western Atlantic, the coast of northern South
   America from Colombia to northern Brazil. The variable species O.
   nasutus (Cuvier and Valenciennes) is to be allopatric with O.
   vespertilio (Linnaeus), which it most resembles; O. nastus ranges from
   the mouth of the Amazon through the Caribbean to the Bahamas and
   southeastern Florida. O. cubifrons (Richardson) ranges from the Bahamas
   and the coast of the southeastern USA into the eastern Gulf of Mexico to
   at least Pensacola, Florida [USA] and Campeche Banks. The name O.
   radiatus (Mitchill) is synonymized with O. cubifrons. Illustrated keys,
   photographs, diagnoses and distribution maps are provided.

AB This paper describes a 2 month study of the patterns of abundance,
   feeding pressure, diet and feeding selectivity in corallivorous tubelip
   wrasses (Labridae), rarely studied, yet widespread and abundant group of
   corallivores on Indo-Pacific coral reefs. The relative abundance and
   feeding pressure of corallivorous wrasses and butterflyfishes
   (Chaetodontidae) in Kimbe Bay, Papua New Guinea, were compared. Overall,
   tubelip wrasses were more than twice as abundant as corallivorous
   butterflyfishes and accounted for three times as many feeding bites on
   corals. The three most abundant tubelip wrasses (yellowtail tubelip
   Diproctacanthus xanthurus, Allen's tubelip Labropsis alleni and the
   tubelip wrasse Labrichthys unilineatus) were all obligate corallivores
   taking > 97% of bites from the surface of live corals. Labropsis alleni
   and D. xanthurus were highly selective, consuming preferred prey species
   in proportions significantly higher than expected given their
   availability. In contrast, L. unilineatus was fairly non-selective and
   consumed most corals in direct accordance with their availability. As
   coral predators, tubelip wrasses are highly comparable to coral-feeding
   butterflyfishes in the coral species consumed, range of dietary
   specialization and their reliance on live coral. Tubelip wrasses,
   however, may supersede butterflyfishes as the predominant corallivorous
   family in some Indo-Pacific locations, and coral-feeding tubelip wrasses
   are likely to be severely affected by coral decline.

AB Killer whales Orcinus orca are found in all oceans of the world, but
   most of our knowledge on the species comes from studies conducted at
   higher latitudes. Studies on killer whales in the Caribbean have been
   scarce. We compiled 176 records of killer whales from the Caribbean,
   including 95 previously unreported records and 81 records recovered from
   the literature, consisting of 27 capture or kill records, 4 stranding
   records and 145 sighting records. Our results indicate that killer
   whales are widespread in the Caribbean Sea and can be found year-round
   in the region. Mean group size was 3.7 animals. A diversity of prey
   items was recorded, including sea turtles and marine mammals and
   possibly fish. We cannot exclude ecotype or morphotype-specific dietary
   specialization in the Caribbean population. A preliminary morphological
   analysis of 10 characters in 52 individuals from 21 different groups
   suggests that Caribbean killer whales do not represent any of the four
   Antarctic and subantarctic types, type 1 from the northwest Atlantic, or
   resident' and transient' killer whales from the northwest Pacific. Some
   Caribbean killer whales share a combination of characters typical of
   type 2 in the North Atlantic, whereas others share those typical of
   offshore' killer whales in the northwest Pacific. The significance of
   this is unclear. Comparison of Caribbean killer whales to previously
   described morphotypes and ecotypes is hampered by the lack of detailed,
   quantitative data on variation within other types, as well as by the
   lack of comparisons of genetic diversity. Our study adds to the growing
   knowledge of the diversity of killer whales worldwide but underscores
   that additional research is warranted in the tropics.

AB Marita Conlan-McKenna's Under the Hawthorne Tree (1990) and James
   Berry's Ajeemah and His Son (1991) are children's novels that address
   foundational national or regional trauma (dealing with transatlantic
   slavery and the Irish potato famine respectively). Both employ
   historical fictive modes to bring the nineteenth century to life, in the
   process illustrating the extractive capitalism at the heart of the
   colonial endeavour. Links between Ireland and the Caribbean have long
   existed, Hilary Beckles observing the persistent characterization of the
   Irish as 'one-dimensional colonial characters [...] battered and bruised
   by a triumphant imperial Englishness that viewed them as "baggage" along
   the route from Cork and Limerick through Bristol to Boston and Barbados'
   (Beckles ix). Expanding on this sense of Ireland and the Caribbean as
   jointly tethered to global imperial trends, this article focuses on the
   role of food and consumption, arguing that these novels make clear the
   ongoing role of food scarcity and land control within the cyclical
   crises of capitalist expansion. Ajeemah and His Son reinforces the
   importance of land ownership in Jamaica as its protagonist falls in line
   with the values of the society he has been thrust into, while Under the
   Hawthorne Tree frames famine as a representative crisis of the
   world-system.

AB Rice rats (Sigmodontinae: Oryzomyini) are abundant in the Late
   Quaternary fossil record and in Holocene pre-Columbian archaeological
   middens across the Lesser Antilles. All of these rice rats are now
   extinct, and their regional diversity and systematics remain extremely
   poorly understood. We redescribe all of the region's rice rat taxa known
   from adequate diagnostic material (Megalomys desmarestii, Megalomys
   luciae, and Oligoryzomys victus), and describe a new genus and species,
   Pennatomys nivalis gen. et sp. nov., from archaeological sites on St.
   Eustatius, St. Kitts, and Nevis, which formed a single larger island
   during Quaternary low sea-level stands. Cladistic analysis supports the
   inclusion of O. victus within Oligoryzomys, and identifies Megalomys as
   a sister group of the large-bodied genera Sigmodontomys or Sigmodontomys
   + Nectomys, suggesting that large body size in Megalomys represents
   phyletic gigantism rather than 'island gigantism'. Megalomys and
   Pennatomys belong to an oryzomyine clade that has undergone remarkable
   radiation throughout the oceanic and continental-shelf islands of the
   Neotropical region, but these genera do not represent a monophyletic
   group within the Nectomys subclade, indicating multiple over-water
   colonization events of the Lesser Antillean island chain. Although
   Lesser Antillean rice rats were heavily exploited by prehistoric
   Amerindians, it is likely that most or all of these taxa survived until
   European arrival in the region. (c) 2010 The Linnean Society of London,

AB Studies of the effects of the Central American Seaway's closure on
   microfossil taxa and stable isotopes of foraminifera previously
   addressed the timing of emplacement of the Caribbean tropical eastern
   Pacific sill, changes in marine nutrients, evolutionary and
   paleobiogeographic events associated with closure, and rates of uplift
   in Central America. However, there have been no quantitative studies of
   the transisthmian divergence of whole biotas. Here we assess
   biogeographic effects of the closing Central American Seaway by
   comparing middle Miocene to Pliocene, neritic benthic foraminiferal
   assemblages from Falcon State, Venezuela, to those of coeval deposits
   with similar paleoenvironments from Panama, Costa Rica, and Ecuador.
   Benthic foraminiferal assemblages from the Urumaco, Codore, Caujarao;
   and La Vela formations of Venezuela's central coast were compared to
   other Caribbean and tropical eastern Pacific assemblages with Simpson's,
   Dice, and Jaccard similarity coefficients. Results of the Simpson's
   Coefficient indicate that the Caribbean inner neritic faunas of
   Venezuela, Costa Rica, and Panama became significantly more similar from
   the late Miocene to Pliocene, as mixing with Pacific waters was reduced
   and modern oceanic conditions of the Caribbean Sea were established.

AB Tests of benthic foraminifera were analyzed quantitatively in 43 surface
   sediment samples collected along E-W traverses across the modern
   isolated carbonate platforms of Glovers Reef (N=14), Lighthouse Reef
   (N=14), and Turneffe Islands (N=15), offshore Belize, Central America.
   Water depths of sample stations range from 0 m (beach) to 40 m (fore
   reel). Each sample was sieved in the size classes 2-1, 1-0.5, 0.5-0.25,
   and 0.25-0.125 mm (phi=1-0, 0-1, 1-2, and 2-3, respectively) and 300
   foraminiferal identifications were attempted for each sieve fraction
   (i.e., 1,200 individuals per sample, totaling 46,003 specimens). Cluster
   analyses of samples characterized platform environments and
   distinguished four benthic/braminifera associations. Fore reef samples
   were characterized by abundant Amphistegina gibbosa and the occurrence
   of Asterigerina carinata, both rotaliids. In high-energy, marginal-reef
   areas the encrusting rotaliid Homotrema rubrum predominated.
   Platform-interior environments were marked by a variety of common taxa,
   the most common of which include Miliolina such as Archaias angulatus,
   Quinqueloculina sp., and Trilocuhna sp., as well as the rotaliid
   Cribroelphidium poeyanum, the latter indicating low-energy or
   deep-lagoonal regimes. Diversity, expressed as numbers of identified
   taxa, appears to be a function of relative degree of circulation. The
   highest number (147) of taxa was found in the shallow, high-energy
   platform of Lighthouse Reef, followed by Glovers Reef (78), both of
   which are open to the Caribbean Sea. The lowest number of taxa (66)
   occurred in Turneffe Islands where large parts of the platform are
   characterized by the restricted circulation imposed by dense mangrove
   growth behind platform margins. The occurrence of tests of common
   foraminiferal species outside their original habitats, coupled with
   trends towards smaller grain-sizes and better sorting of tests away from
   original habitats along parts of the sample traverses, indicates
   sediment transport across platform margins. In the great majority of
   samples, however, sediment redeposition did not significantly alter
   characteristic taxonomic compositions. This result has important
   implications for the use of benthic foraminifera as facies indicators in
   fossil carbonate platforms.

AB Polynesian rats R. exulans were trapped for population studies. The
   content of 602 rat stomachs from 18 islets was grossly examined and the
   analysis is presented. Volume estimates confirmed that the major diet of
   the Polynesian rat was of vegetational origin (98.7%). Most commonly
   found was unidentified plant pulp (56.6%) and coconut meat (21.2%) which
   mostly derived from the trap bait. Monocotyledonous materials, such as
   grass stems, root parts, and seeds, made up 17.7% of the food eaten,
   followed by meat of Pandamus fruits with 3.2%. This relative low figure
   is depended on the irregular availability of cultivated varieties. By
   volume the average animal matter portion was relatively low, 1.3%. The
   prevalence of animal remains was relatively higher. Ants (24.5%) were
   frequently found and probably had been eaten along with coconut baits
   and fruits. The same was assumed for fruitfly maggots (2.7%). The
   Polynesian rat is primarily a herbivore and a scavenger but may
   occasionally assume the role of predator. The kind of damage which may
   be inflicted to coconut plantations within the geographical range of
   this small rat species is discussed.

AB The late Miocene Gatun Formation of northern Panama Contains a highly
   diverse and well sampled fossil marine assemblage that occupied a
   shallow-water embayment close to a purported connection between the
   Pacific and Atlantic (Caribbean) oceans. However, the diverse
   chondrichthyan fauna has been poorly documented. Based on recent field
   discoveries and further analysis of existing collections, the
   chondrichthyan fauna from this unit comprises at least 26 taxa, of which
   four species are extinct today. The remaining portion of the total
   chondrichthyan biodiversity has affmities with modern taxa and is
   therefore comprised of long-lived species. Based on known records of the
   modern geographic distribution range of the Gatun chondrichthyans, the
   fauna has mixed biogeographic affinities suggesting that around 10
   million yr ago, a connection likely occurred between the Pacific Ocean
   and the Caribbean Sea. Given the known habitat preferences for modern
   chondrichthyans, the Gatun fauna was primarily adapted to shallow waters
   within the neritic zone. Finally, comparisons of Gatun dental
   measurements with other faunas suggest that many of the taxa have an
   abundance of small individuals, in agreement with previous studies that
   proposed this area as a paleonursery habitat for the species
   Carcharocles megalodon.

   sp., Characella pachastrelloides n. sp., Geodia curacaoensis n. sp.,
   Caminus carmabi n. sp., Discodermia adhaerens n. sp., Clathria

   Parahigginsia strongylifera n. sp., Calyx magnoculata n. sp.,
   Neopetrosia dutchi n. sp., Neopetrosia ovata n. sp. and Neopetrosia
   eurystomata n. sp. We also report an euretid hexactinellid, which
   belongs to the rare genus Verrucocoeloidea, recently described (2014) as
   V. liberatorii Reiswig & Dohrmann. The remaining 18 already known
   species are all illustrated by photos of the habit, either in situ or
   'on deck', but only briefly characterized in an annotated table to
   confirm their occurrence in the Southern Caribbean. The habitat
   investigated-steep limestone rocks, likely representing Pleistocene
   fossil reefs-is similar to deep-water fossil reefs at Barbados of which
   the sponges were sampled and studied by Van Soest and Stentoft (1988). A
   comparison is made between the two localities, showing a high degree of
   similarity in sponge composition: 53% of the present Bonaire-Klein
   Curacao species were also retrieved at Barbados. At the level of higher
   taxa (genera, families) Bonaire-Klein Curacao shared approximately 80%
   of its lower mesophotic and upper dysphotic sponge fauna with Barbados,
   despite a distance between them of 1000 km, indicating high faunal
   homogeneity. We also preliminarily compared the shallow-water (euphotic)
   sponge fauna of Curacao with the combined data available for the
   Barbados, Bonaire and Klein Curacao mesophotic and upper dysphotic
   sponges, which resulted in the conclusion that the two faunas show only
   little overlap.

AB The spatial distribution of the benthic invertebrate fauna of Konaiano
   Creek, a small, aseasonal, tropical mountain rainforest stream on
   Bougainville Island, Papua New Guinea, was studied for one year.
   Although the benthic fauna exhibited no pattern of temporal change, with
   all species undergoing continuous recruitment and growth, there was a
   clear pattern of spatial distribution with distinct, but intergrading
   communities in the waterfalls, riffles, runs and pools. Current speed
   and substrate particle size decrease progressively from the waterfalls
   (bedrock and boulders), to the riffles (boulders and cobbles), runs
   (cobbles and gravel) and pools (gravel and sand). The waterfalls and
   riffles exhibited the greatest density of fauna (mean abundance >13,000
   animals/m(2)) and riffles had the greatest species richness, but
   equitability was highest in the runs and pools. All but two of 18
   species examined showed significant preferences for particular habitats.
   The distribution of detritus within the stream and, to a lesser extent,
   the occurrence of spates, as well as flow regime, influenced the
   abundance of many of the less common taxa.

AB Lionfish, native to reef ecosystems of the tropical and sub-tropical
   Indo-Pacific, were introduced to Florida waters in the 1980s, and have
   spread rapidly throughout the northwestern Atlantic, Caribbean Sea and
   the Gulf of Mexico. These invasive, carnivorous fish significantly
   reduce other fish and benthic invertebrate biomass, fish recruitment,
   and species richness in reef ecosystems. Fisheries resource managers
   have proposed the establishment of a commercial fishery to reduce
   lionfish populations and mitigate adverse effects on reef communities.
   The potential for a commercial fishery for lionfish is the primary
   reason to identify locations where lionfish accumulate sufficient
   amounts of ciguatoxin (CTX) to cause ciguatera fish poisoning (CFP), the
   leading cause of non-bacterial seafood poisoning associated with fish
   consumption. To address this issue, an initial geographic assessment of
   CTX toxicity in lionfish from the Caribbean and Gulf of Mexico was
   conducted. Lionfish samples (n = 293) were collected by spearfishing
   from 13 locations (74 sampling sites) around the Caribbean and Gulf of
   Mexico between 2012 and 2015. The highest frequencies of lionfish
   containing measurable CTX occurred in areas known to be high-risk
   regions for CFP in the central to eastern Caribbean (e.g., 53% British
   Virgin Islands and 5% Florida Keys). Though measurable CTX was found in
   some locations, the majority of the samples (99.3%) contained CTX
   concentrations below the United States Food and Drug Administration
   guidance level of 0.1 ppb Caribbean ciguatoxin-1 (C-CTX-1) equivalents
   (eq.). Only 0.7% of lionfish tested contained more than 0.1 ppb C-CTX-1
   eq. As of 2018, there has been one suspected case of CFP from eating
   lionfish. Given this finding, current risk reduction techniques used to
   manage CTX accumulating fish are discussed.

AB High-resolution Nd- and Pb-isotope time series for the last 8 Myr are
   reported for four Atlantic ferromanganese crusts, dated by Be-10/Be-9
   chronology. These are compared to new high-resolution and high-precision
   Pb-isotope time series and recently published Nd-isotope time series for
   two previously studied crusts from the NW Atlantic Ocean. These records
   allow a more detailed examination of Atlantic deepwater variability over
   the time period of intensification of Northern Hemisphere Glaciation
   (NHG). Changes in the Pb-isotope time series started after 3 Ma, but
   were most dramatic over the last 1.8 Myr, coinciding with changes of
   Pb-isotopes in the Arctic Ocean. This latter change post-dates the
   intensification of NHG at 3.1 to 2.5 Ma and reflects an increase in the
   input of material eroded from the Archean Shield of Canada and
   Greenland. Shifts in Nd- and Pb-isotope compositions in a crust from the
   Blake Plateau occur before similar to 5 Ma and most prominent at similar
   to 8 Ma suggest that water masses from either the Pacific or Southern
   Ocean influenced the isotope composition of this crust. The relatively
   high epsilon(Nd) values around 8 Ma recorded by the Blake Plateau crust
   are explained by a contribution of eastward flowing Pacific water
   through the Panama Gateway into the Caribbean Sea. This high epsilon(Nd)
   signal decreased between 8 and 5 Ma suggesting that the supply of
   Pacific water into the Caribbean became restricted. This is earlier than
   the Caribbean seawater salinity increase at 4.2 Ma deduced from
   delta(18)O data, and may indicate that there was only a surface water
   connection between the Caribbean and Pacific between similar to 5 and
   4.2 Ma. The closure of the Panama Gateway tb intermediate and deep water
   exchange (>200 m depth) apparently occurred much earlier than the
   intensification of Northern Hemisphere Glaciation at 3.1-2.5 Ma, and
   cannot therefore have been a direct cause of this climatic change, but
   may, as recently argued, only have been a necessary precondition. (C)

AB Small-scale fisheries play a critical role in both poverty alleviation
   and food security. A large proportion of the world fish stocks are,
   however, getting fully or over-exploited. In this article we address
   these issues in the context of the small-scale fisheries of the Solomon
   Islands. The paper explores the extent to which in-shore Fish
   Aggregating Devices (FADs) can help increasing the resilience of the
   small scale fishery system and reconciling social, economic and
   ecological priorities. Based on the concept of 'time of crisis'
   developed recently in the viability literature, we propose to calculate
   a resilience index through a dynamic stochastic model calibrated by
   ethnological observations. The resilience index calculation reveals two
   major findings: (i) the resilience of the small scale fishery system is
   currently nonexistent and (ii) the introduction of FADs can improve it.
   The effects of the FADs' implementation are then discussed in the light
   of a socio-economic perspective. Such results bring new insights into
   the question of the future of the small scale fishery sector, especially
   in relation to the local economy evolution from a barter dominance to a
   cash oriented economy. At the same time, the current subsistence
   fisheries seems more resilient in general due to a distributive effects
   which ease the 'race for fish behaviors'. Finally, our analysis reveals
   that while the FADs implementation stands as a short and mid-term
   answer, demographic drivers are important and other alternatives will
   need to be considered if the overall viability of the system is to be
   maintained in the longer-term. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

AB Monoculture plantations of exotic Caribbean pine Pinus caribaea have
   been planted extensively in many tropical countries, but little is known
   about the bird communities inhabiting them. From October 1995 to
   September 1996, we compared bird populations in a 37-ha stand of mature
   Caribbean pine forest (planted in 1972) with an adjacent, similar-sized
   stand of native broad-leaved forest at Mount Saint Benedict, Trinidad,
   West Indies. Ten censuses, each including 10 fixed-radius point counts
   (25 m radius, 10 minutes duration), were conducted simultaneously during
   different months of the year in each habitat. Both species richness and
   species diversity were significantly lower in the pine forest, but the
   overall abundance of individual birds did not differ between the two
   forests. Seasonal variation in bird populations was more pronounced in
   the pine forest, where fewer birds (and presumably food resources) were
   present during the dry season. The pine forest bird community was
   dominated by forest edge specialists and the native forest by forest
   interior specialists at both the individual and species levels. At the
   individual level, nectarivores, aerial foragers and understorey foragers
   were proportionately more common in the pine forest; insectivores and
   canopy foragers were more common in the native forest. At the species
   level, more aerial foragers occurred in the pine forest and more
   understorey foragers in the native forest. The diversity of bird
   communities in pine plantations may be promoted by increasing habitat
   heterogeneity.

AB The nearshore foraminifera of the oligotrophic Caribbean region are
   predominantly epiphytal, living on calcareous algae and seagrasses.
   However, their community ecology (interactions between and associations
   among species) is little understood. Cluster analysis is used here to
   identify guilds among the epiphytal foraminifera, a guild being a group
   of species that forms an arena of intense competition within which
   species' niches overlap considerably in habitat, time and food.
   Samples were collected monthly between September 1994 and August 1995
   from (a) ualcareous algae and (b) seagrass rhizomes and leaf bosses from
   two bays around Nevis, northern Lesser Antilles. One bay was impacted by
   organic enrichment from a leaking septic tank. Data from both bays were
   combined to form a metapopulation, analysis of which was conducted using
   common species (i.e., those that formed > 1% of the recovery from any
   substrate in either bay). Q-mode cluster analysis using populations on
   all substrates of common species clearly separated the two bays, despite
   sampling of the same substrate in both, indicating that the bays occupy
   different biofacies. However, Q-mode analysis did not separate the
   different substrates in the individual bays, R-mode cluster analysis of
   the two-bay metapopulation based on common species revealed three
   clusters that are interpreted as guilds:
   Guild I A higher-energy guild intolerant of nutrient enrichment.
   Guild II A guild of rapidly-reproducing opportunists on short-lived
   substrates.
   Guild III A lower-energy guild tolerant of nutrient enrichment.
   These guilds are not limited to any one bay, but vary in proportion
   between the two, Guild I being most prolific in the virtually pristine
   back-reef bay on the windward side of the island, and Guilds II and III
   forming a greater proportion of the epiphytal foraminiferal fauna in the
   bay impacted by lower-energy waves and a flux of organic matter. Guild
   II shows a preference for the bushy capitulae of the alga Penicillus
   capitatus. In cross-correlation of 12-month time-series for the three
   guilds, the virtually pristine bay showed that they bloomed
   sequentially, at intervals of 4 months.
   The recognition of guilds clears the way for improved understanding of
   the foraminiferal community ecology of nearshore areas. Nearshore
   sediments in the Caribbean yield primarily foraminifera washed from
   phytal substrates, The palaeoecology of these assemblages can now be
   interpreted with greater confidence. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V All rights

AB Ending women's overrepresentation among the poor in the Caribbean is not
   only a human right, but also a political and economic imperative. 
   Caribbean women are central to agriculture, food production, marketing,
   and processing; moreover, they are the main providers of health,
   education, and other services.  However, in both the Caribbean household
   and most wings of the Pan-African movement, women are infantalized and
   regarded as subordinate.  If Pan-Africanism is to benefit from the
   talents and energies of women, it must make female oppression a major
   concern.  The movement must take the lead in speaking out against
   harmful, degrading social practices such as female circumcision. Hopeful
   are two approaches to self-organization spearheaded by the Garvey wing
   of Pan-Africanism.  Sistren, san education and theater collective in
   Jamaica that was initiated by female street cleaners in 1977, has shown
   working class women an alternative to oppression.  Its
   socialist-feminist street theater, based on the concept that "the
   personal is political," is organized around personal testimonies that
   illustrate the link between private experience and social structures. 
   Red Thread, organized in Guyana in 1985, is affiliated with the Working
   People's Alliance.  In addition to supporting self-determination for
   women, Red Thread sides with the poor and powerless, is committed to
   multiracial policies, defends indigenous Amerindians evicted from their
   land by colonialists, and rejects the corruption and one-man leadership
   style of traditional political organizations.  Poor women have been
   recruited in a nonpartisan manner through use of embroidery groups and
   income-generating projects.

AB The rare earth element (REE) concentrations of full water column
   profiles from ten stations in the Caribbean, the Gulf of Mexico, and the
   Florida Straits, as well as of surface waters close to the mouth of the
   Orinoco River have been analyzed. The results show a high concentration
   of REEs in surface waters, in particular close to the mouth of the
   Orinoco, and a middle-REE-enrichment that is strongest in the south and
   east of the study area suggesting that fluvial inputs are the main
   sources rather than REEs supplied by Saharan dust. The surface waters
   close to the Orinoco are heavy REE enriched compared to the potential
   fluvial sources, emphasizing the importance of processes in the
   estuaries and the surface ocean that preferentially remove light- and
   middle-REEs. Relatively small heavy-REE enrichments in near-bottom water
   samples at the mouth of the Orinoco may be the result of preferential
   release of light REEs from river-transported sediments. The REE patterns
   of distinct subsurface water masses are largely coherent across the
   Caribbean basin, suggesting that the lateral transport of preformed
   compositions is not significantly influenced by vertical processes of
   scavenging and release. In particular, low Dy/ Er molar ratios are
   associated with Antarctic Intermediate Water and have most likely been
   advected into the Caribbean from the Southern Ocean. In contrast, deep
   waters in the Caribbean are enriched in light and middle REEs compared
   to incoming Upper North Atlantic Deep Water suggesting that release from
   sinking particles or from sediments is an important source of these REEs
   in the deep ocean, in particular when deep water residence times are
   long. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Small Island Developing States (SIDS) are characterized by high levels
   of biodiversity that are under threat. Simultaneously, the tourism
   sector plays a key role in many of these economies. In this paper, the
   Hausman-Taylor estimator is used to investigate a tourism demand
   function in SIDS in which marine and terrestrial biodiversity play a key
   role, in addition to the traditional economic and price variables. This
   estimator allows for both the presence of time-invariant variables, a
   standard feature of environmental data, and the existence of endogenous
   covariates. Levels of biodiversity are found to have a significant
   influence on tourism in SIDS and, in particular, a test for redundant
   variables shows that the biodiversity variables are jointly significant.
   This justifies their inclusion in a tourism demand function, over and
   above the conventional economic factors, and points to the importance of
   national and international policy in protecting the biodiversity of
   SIDS.

   any El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) variability superimposed on this

   multidecadal stable isotopic time series from an extremely well
   preserved central Caribbean coral dating to the Miocene-Pliocene
   transition, prior to closure of the Central American Seaway (CAS).
   Paleoceanographic modeling suggests that the flow of water associated
   with El Nino and La Nina events through the CAS allowed Caribbean corals
   to record the ENSO-related SST anomalies. Spectral analysis of coral
   oxygen isotope ratios reveals periodicities similar to modern ENSO
   signatures, suggesting that ENSO-like variability characterized the
   Miocene-Pliocene transition.

   awareness about dengue and its etiology was evident, but there was poor
   understanding of the symptoms and hence little concern about the health
   risks associated with it. The most important household pest problem
   identified by the respondents was related to mosquito nuisance,
   particularly from night-biting mosquitoes. Rodents were also a major
   concern perceived as being responsible for economic losses, ruined food,
   and a health hazard. Unreliable water supply, a factor associated with
   Aedes aegypti abundance, was an environmental sanitation issue of major
   importance to householders in rural areas. No correlation was found
   between knowledge of dengue and levels of Ae. aegypti abundance as
   measured by larval surveys of the respondents' premises. The study gave
   a clear indication of the need for broad-based environmental sanitation
   strategies when planning community-based vector control initiatives for
   the prevention and control of dengue in Trinidad and Tobago.

AB The harpacticoid copepod Balaenophilus manatorum (Ortiz, Lalana and
   Torres, 1992) was originally described based on a few specimens
   collected from a single manatee in Cuba. Since its description it has
   been recorded exclusively as a symbiont of sea turtles worldwide; there
   were no further records of this species from the manatee and this
   association remained unconfirmed. During a long-term survey on the
   biology and ecology of the manatee Trichechus manatus manatus L. in
   Mexican waters of the western Caribbean, epibionts were collected from
   54 individuals, including males, females and juveniles. Many specimens
   of B. manatorum were recorded from several manatees and analysed
   morphologically; a comparison is made with specimens from turtles of the
   Mexican Pacific. Manatees captured in two different bay systems were
   examined, but only those from Chetumal Bay were positive for copepods.
   Infestation comprised 14 manatees (26%), eight females and six males;
   incidence was higher than that previously found for other crustacean
   epibionts. Copepods were found as soft yellowish masses arranged along
   skin folds and wrinkles of the muzzle, the base of the fins, and the
   nipple area; there was no evidence of skin damage caused by the copepod.
   The presence of B. manatorum on manatees is confirmed and the first data
   are provided on the prevalence of this epibiont in one of the main
   populations of this mammal in the western Caribbean.

AB Migrating barramundi (Perciformes : Centropomidae) spawners support a
   valuable artisanal fishery on the coast of south-western Papua New
   Guinea. This fishery declined dramatically during the 1990s shortly
   after the large Ok Tedi copper mine began in the headwaters of the large
   Fly River nearby. In order to understand the factors causing the
   decline, populations were sampled quarterly with gill-nets at over 20
   sites throughout the Fly River from 1987 to 2001. Barramundi were most
   abundant in the middle and upper reaches of the Fly River. No evidence
   was found that output from the large Ok Tedi mine was negatively
   impacting on barramundi catch rates. However, the commercial fishery in
   the middle Fly River was found to have a negative impact on the weight
   of barramundi in monitoring catches in that region. Additionally, catch
   rates of juvenile barramundi ( 1 year olds) in the Fly River were
   negatively correlated with the amount of rainfall on the breeding
   grounds during the previous monsoon. This suggests that the reduced
   catch rates in the coastal commercial fishery in the late 1980s and
   early 1990s may have been affected by both the riverine commercial
   fishery and the El Nino (ENSO) that occurred at that time.

AB The Caribbean is one of the world's centers of biodiversity and
   endemism. As in similar regions, many of its islands have complex
   topography, climate and soils, and ecological zones change over small
   areas. A segmented, supervised classification approach using Landsat TM
   imagery enabled us to develop the most detailed island-wide map of
   Puerto Rico's extremely complex natural vegetation cover. Many Caribbean
   forest formations that are not spectrally distinct had distributions
   approximately separable using climatic zone, geology, elevation, and
   rainfall. Classification accuracy of 26 land cover and woody vegetation
   classes was 71 % overall and 83 % after combining forest successional
   stages within image mapping zones. In 1991-92, Puerto Rico had about
   364,000 ha of closed forest, which covered 41.6 % of the main island.
   Unlike previous island-wide mapping, this map better identifies the
   spatial distributions of forest formations where certain groups of
   endemic species occur. Approximately 5 % of Puerto Rico's forest area is
   under protection, but the reserve system grossly underrepresents lowland
   moist, seasonal evergreen forests.

AB This study presents the most complete generic phylogenetic framework to
   date for the tribe Coleeae (Bignoniaceae), which is endemic to
   Madagascar and the other smaller islands in the western part of the
   Indian Ocean. The study is based on plastid and nuclear DNA regions and
   includes 47 species representing the five currently recognized genera
   (including all the species occurring in the western Indian Ocean
   region). Bayesian and maximum likelihood analyses supported (i) the
   monophyly of the tribe, (ii) the monophyly of Phylloctenium,
   Phyllarthron and Rhodocolea and (iii) the paraphyly of Colea due to the
   inclusion of species of Ophiocolea. The latter genus was also recovered
   paraphyletic due to the inclusion of two species of Colea (C. decora and
   C. labatii). The taxonomic implications of the mutual paraphyly of these
   two genera are discussed in light of morphological evidence, and it is
   concluded that the two genera should be merged, and the necessary new
   nomenclatural combinations are provided. The phylogenetic framework
   shows Phylloctenium, which is endemic to Madagascar and restricted to
   dry ecosystems, as basal and sister to the rest of the tribe, suggesting
   Madagascar to be the centre of origin of this Glade. The remaining
   genera are diversified mostly in humid ecosystems, with evidence of
   multiple dispersals to the neighboring islands, including at least two
   to the Comoros, one to Mauritius and one to the Seychelles. Finally, we
   hypothesize that the ecological success of this tribe might have been
   triggered by a shift of fruit-dispersal mode from wind to lemur. (C)

AB Grande Riviere Beach in Trinidad and Tobago is an important nesting site
   in the Caribbean for the Critically Endangered leatherback sea turtle,
   Dermochelys coriacea. Community members were concerned that beach
   erosion and seasonal river flooding were destroying many of the nests
   deposited annually and thought that a hatchery was a possible solution.
   Over the 2001 turtle nesting season, the Institute of Marine Affairs
   (IMA) assessed the spatial and temporal distribution of nests using the
   Global Positioning System recorded to reference points, and beach
   dynamics using permanent bench mark profile stations, to determine areas
   of high risk and more stable areas for nesting. A total of 1449
   leatherback nests were positioned. It was evident that at the start of
   the season in March, the majority of leatherback nests were deposited at
   the eastern section of the beach. After May, there was a continuing
   westward shift in nest distribution as the season progressed until
   August and beach erosion in the eastern section became predominant. The
   backshore remained relatively stable along the entire beach throughout
   the nesting season, and erosion was predominant in the foreshore at the
   eastern section of the beach, from the middle to the end of the season.
   Similar trends-in accretion and erosion were observed in 2000. River
   flooding did not occur during the study period or in the previous year.
   With both high risk and more stable regions for turtle nesting available
   at Grande Riviere Beach, there was no compelling evidence to justify the
   need for a hatchery.

AB This study of a Vincentian community in the Eastern Caribbean explores
   the impacts of income on dietary quality and food import dependency It
   finds that two forms of income - total household income and the income
   that women control - are positively correlated with total dietary
   diversity as well as with frequency of consumption of numerous imported
   foods. However, no relation is evident between banana incomes and
   consumption of imported foods, thus questioning the general belief in
   the literature that the growth of banana production has been responsible
   for increasing dependence on food imports in the Windward Islands. The
   beneficial impacts of income on dietary quality that have been found in
   many other developing areas are more limited here because malnutrition
   is not a widespread problem. But income is closely linked to consumption
   of foods that contribute to overnutrition and obesity, growing concerns
   in the English-speaking Caribbean.

AB Deep and large submarine slumps may generate tsunamis as disastrous as
   tsunamis of tectonic origin. Such a landslide is likely to be the origin
   of the 1998 July 17 tsunami of Papua New Guinea, the deadliest tsunami
   in the last 50 years. Water waves devastated a 20 km stretch of
   coastline, wiping out three villages and killing more than 2200 people.
   A numerical model has been developed to study the efficiency of deep
   slumps in producing tsunamis and has been applied to the Papua New
   Guinea event.
   The landslide is treated as the flow of a homogeneous gravity-driven
   continuum governed by a rheological law. Water waves are generated by
   sea-bottom displacements induced by the landslide. The shallow-water
   approximation is adopted for both the landslide and the: associated
   water waves. The resulting differential equations are solved by a finite
   difference method based on shook-capturing. The shallow-water hypothesis
   is tested by comparison with a model solving Navier-Stokes equations for
   a mixture of water and sediments. Sensitivity tests carried out for a
   2-D Simplified geometry show that the water surface profile depends
   strongly on the constitutive law of the landslide.
   The 1998 event is simulated numerically by the shallow-water model,
   testing different friction laws. The observed inundation height
   distribution is well reproduced by the model for a volume of 4 km(3),
   with its top located at a water depth of 550 m, and sliding with a
   Coulomb-type friction law over a distance of 5 km.

AB The Caribbean barrier reef near Carrie Bow Cay, Belize, has been a focus
   of Smithsonian Institution (Washington) reef and mangrove investigations
   since the early 1970s. Systematics and biology of sponges (Porifera)
   were addressed by several researchers but none of the studies dealt with
   cryptic habitats, such as the shaded undersides of coral rubble, reef
   crevices, and caves, although a high species diversity was recognized
   and samples were taken for future reference and study. This paper is the
   result of processing samples taken between 1972 and 2012. In all, 122
   species were identified, 14 of them new (including one new genus). The
   new species are Tetralophophora (new genus) mesoamericana, Geodia
   cribrata, Placospongia caribica, Prosuberites carriebowensis, Timea
   diplasterina, Timea oxyasterina, Rhaphidhistia belizensis, Wigginsia
   curlewensis, Phorbas aurantiacus, Myrmekioderma laminatum, Niphates
   arenata, Siphonodictyon occultum, Xestospongia purpurea, and Aplysina
   sciophila. We determined that about 75 of the 122 cryptic sponge species
   studied (61%) are exclusive members of the sciophilic community, 47 (39
   %) occur in both, light-exposed and shaded or dark habitats. Since we
   estimate the previously known sponge population of Carrie Bow reefs and
   mangroves at about 200 species, the cryptic fauna makes up 38 % of total
   diversity.

AB Migrant narratives of Indo-Caribbean religious practices in the smaller
   island states of the Caribbean are rare, and that Diaspora's funerary
   traditions are even less explored. This scholarly lacuna is addressed
   here by using data from ethnographic research conducted in St. Lucia to
   examine the funerary ritual of a Lucian-Indian feast through the
   multidisciplinary lens of glocalization. Specifically, we investigate
   the following: (a) ways that the diasporic identity of Lucian-Indians
   has been adapted and re-configured within a local-global nexus; (b) the
   extent to which there has been a local construction of a distinct
   socio-spatial identity among Lucian-Indians, one retaining Hinduness
   even as they assimilated into the larger St. Lucian society; and (c)
   whether glocal characteristics can be identified in the performance of a
   particular funeral feast. Following Roudometof, we posit that many
   aspects of a Lucian-Indian ethno-religious funerary ritual demonstrate
   indigenized and transnational glocalization.

   diazotrophs were present all along the transect, Trichodesmium spp. were
   detected only in coastal waters, where nitrogen fixation associated to
   both size fractions was greatly stimulated.

AB Based on the material deposited in the Museum national d'Histoire
   naturelle, Paris, collected from the Indo-West Pacific, principally from
   the New Caledonian region, the present paper reports 117 palaemonoid
   shrimp species, which belong, respectively, to Anchistioididae ( one
   genus, one species), Gnathophyllidae ( one genus, one species),
   Palaemonidae Palaemoninae ( seven genera, nine species), and
   Palaemonidae Pontoniinae ( 30 genera, 106 species), including eight new
   species. The new species are all Pontoniinae: Mesopontonia brevicarpalis
   sp. nov., Palaemonella komaii sp. nov., Periclimenes crosnieri sp. nov.,
   Periclimenes forgesi sp. nov., Periclimenes loyautensis sp. nov.,
   Periclimenes paralcocki sp. nov., Periclimenes paraleator sp. nov., and
   Periclimenes pseudalcocki sp. nov. The last six new species are members
   of the deep-water "Periclimenes alcocki species complex'', which has
   more than two ( usually four) pairs of dorsolateral telson spines
   anterior to the posterior telson margin, the cornea is usually reduced,
   the dactyl of the major second chela is generally flanged and the chela
   is sometimes covered with small tubercles. The complex is usually found
   at more than 200m depth in the West Pacific. The species can be
   distinguished from each other by the armature of ambulatory propod and
   dactyl, diameter of cornea, rostrum shape and the number of pairs of
   dorsolateral telson spines. Mesopontonia brevicarpalis sp. nov., from
   the southeast coast of Africa, is the seventh species of the genus.
   Palaemonella komaii sp. nov. is very similar to Palaemonella
   dolichodactylus Bruce, 1991 and Palaemonella hachijo Okuno, 1999. These
   three species share the features of very long and slender ambulatory
   pereiopods with the dactyl more than eight times longer than its basal
   depth and with several long setae on the dorsal dactylar margin.

AB Biotic resistance, the process by which new colonists are excluded from
   a community by predation from and/or competition with resident species,
   can prevent or limit species invasions. We examined whether biotic
   resistance by native predators on Caribbean coral reefs has influenced
   the invasion success of red lionfishes (Pterois volitans and Pterois
   miles), piscivores from the Indo-Pacific. Specifically, we surveyed the
   abundance (density and biomass) of lionfish and native predatory fishes
   that could interact with lionfish (either through predation or
   competition) on 71 reefs in three biogeographic regions of the
   Caribbean. We recorded protection status of the reefs, and abiotic
   variables including depth, habitat type, and wind/wave exposure at each
   site. We found no relationship between the density or biomass of
   lionfish and that of native predators. However, lionfish densities were
   significantly lower on windward sites, potentially because of habitat
   preferences, and in marine protected areas, most likely because of
   ongoing removal efforts by reserve managers. Our results suggest that
   interactions with native predators do not influence the colonization or
   post-establishment population density of invasive lionfish on Caribbean
   reefs.

AB We evaluated mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase I genetic diversity of two
   barnacle species (Eochionelasmus ohtai manusensis, Vulcanolepas cf.
   parensis) at three sites in Manus Basin (Solwara 1, South Su, Solwara
   8). There was no evidence for within-site or between-site genetic
   differentiation for either species. While E. ohtai manusensis showed
   limited genetic variation, V cf. parensis showed greater variation, with
   sequences distributed between two divergent groups. Assuming the
   cytochrome oxidase I gene is not under selection, significantly negative
   Tajima's D in E. ohtai manusensis is consistent with a recent population
   expansion due to a bottleneck or founder effect, whereas V cf. parensis
   (combined groups) did not depart from a stable effective population
   size. Considering the groups separately, V cf. parensis Group 1 (but not
   Group 2) showed a negative Tajima's D, indicating these groups may have
   encountered different historical demographic conditions. Data reported
   here are part of a baseline study against which recovery of genetic
   diversity following mineral extraction at Solwara 1 can be measured. (C)

AB In this paper, the findings are presented of the ichthyofaunal component
   of the Statia Marine Biodiversity Expedition, 2015. Roving visual
   surveys were used to rapidly assess presence/ absence of fish species at
   37 sampling locations within the waters of St. Eustatius, Dutch
   Caribbean. A total of 206 fish species were observed. Using a species
   accrual curve, total species richness was estimated to be between 240
   and 250. Prior to the expedition, 215 fish species were recorded on St.
   Eustatius, bringing the total richness to 307 listed species (43 %
   increase). Of these, 246 were recorded by visual observation and
   fisheries data. The ichthyofaunal richness of St. Eustatius exceeds the
   upper estimate of 250 gained from these surveys, highlighting the
   inadequacies of visual surveys alone. St. Eustatius has comparable
   levels of species richness to similar-sized islands in the Caribbean.
   There were significant differences among fish communities in different
   habitats and depth classes. Further sampling is recommended using a
   variety of methods in order to produce a more accurate species richness
   estimate.

AB Papua New Guinea is enjoying yet another mineral price boom which is
   underpinning a recent expansion in manufacturing and services. But with
   a difference. Unlike in previous booms, prices of most cash crops have
   also been surging, with significant parts of the rural economy
   benefiting. However, it is not clear that there is much expansion of
   smallholder productive capacity. The fundamental constraints continue to
   exist-transport, communication and financial services, as well as the
   poor environment for formal sector investment in agricultural services,
   logistics and processing. The real test of Papua New Guinea's management
   of the boom will be how it translates the surge in earnings into
   investment to address these problems.

AB After over 15 m.y. of evolution in near-surface waters of the Western
   Pacific and Caribbean, planktic foraminifera in the lineage Globorotalia
   (Fohsella) abruptly invaded thermocline habitats at 13 Ma. Stable
   isotope data demonstrate that this habitat shift took 50 ka to complete,
   a duration similar to the fastest measured rates of speciation in marine
   protistans. The ecological change occurred near the end of a long series
   of gradual morphological transitions and demonstrates that at least some
   of the chronospecies in this lineage had distinctive ecologies and were
   probably biological species. Other than this one shift in depth
   distribution, skeletal evolution is largely disconnected from depth
   changes in Globorotalia (Fohsella). Morphological trends of
   globorotaliid foraminifera may not record changes in depth ecology,
   contrary to existing models for foraminiferal diversification.

   O.C.P.S. II 1969, and HMS 'Luymes' Guyana Shelf 1970 expeditions are
   described in this study. Sponges were obtained by trawling, dredging or
   grabbing on sandy, muddy, shelly, and fossil reef bottoms at 88 stations
   between 19 and 681 m depth. A total of 351 samples were identified to
   species level, each consisting of one or more specimens of a given
   species from each individual station (together comprising 547
   individuals and fragments). The collection yielded 119 species together
   belonging to all sponge classes, but in large majority are Demospongiae.
   All species are identified to species level, occasionally tentatively,
   and all are described and illustrated. A new subgenus is proposed,
   Tedania (Stylotedania) subgen. nov. and a previously synonymized genus,
   Tylosigma Topsent, 1894 is revived. Thirtysix species were found to be
   new to science, excluding the first Central West Atlantic record of the
   genus Halicnemia, not named at the species level because of lack of
   sufficient material. The new species erected are, in alphabetical order:

   new combinations are proposed: Amphimedon nanaspiculata (Hartman, 1955)
   comb. nov. and Oceanapia ascidia (Schmidt, 1870) comb. nov. In addition,
   for two preoccupied combinations, new names, Coelosphaera (Coelosphaera)
   barbadensis nom. nov. and Hymedesmia (Hymedesmia) rowi nom. nov., are
   erected. The spatial distribution of the collected specimens over the
   Guyana Shelf was traced and the results were compared with existing
   information on bottom conditions. There was a convincing correlation
   between the location of fossil reefs and other hard substrates such as
   shell ridges with peaks in the occurrence of species diversity and
   specimen numbers. Stations made on sand and mud bottoms away from these
   zones of hard substrates were generally poor in species, but some were
   found to be rich in individuals of specialized soft bottom dwellers such
   as Tetilla pentatriaena, Tribrachium schmidtii, Fangophilina submersa,
   and Oceanapia species.
   The species composition of the Guyana Shelf was compared with that of
   neighbouring regions of the Caribbean and from North and East Brazil
   (Diaz in Miloslavich et al. 2010; Muricy et al. 2011). About 35% of the
   species encountered are widespread in the Central West Atlantic,
   occurring both to the north and to the south. Indications that the
   Guyana Shelf sponge fauna is clearly transitional are southernmost
   occurrences for Caribbean species (about 30%), and northernmost
   occurrences of Brazilian species (13%), with a high proportion (25%) of
   new species, which may be expected to have distributions extending to
   the Caribbean, to Brazil or both regions.

AB Specimens (88) of A. gibbosa, a typical Atlantic-Caribbean species, were
   recovered from a core taken from Santa Rosa-Cortes Ridge off the
   southern California coast [USA]. This recovery constitutes the only
   Neogene record of Amphistegina in this part of the Pacific and is 1 of 3
   verified occurrences of A. gibbosa outside the Atlantic-Caribbean
   region. A living A. gibbosa assemblage was established on Santa
   Rosa-Cortes Ridge in a warm-water reeflike biotope sometime during the
   late Pliocene (probably coeval with deposition of the lower part of the
   San Diego Formation in southern California). The assemblage died upon
   return of cool water conditions during the latest Pliocene and was
   subsequently displaced into upper Pliocene upper bathyal sediments, from
   which samples were taken. This occurrence was interpreted as a record of
   the migration of A. gibbosa from the Caribbean region just before the
   Isthmus of Panama totally emerged. Complete emergence of this barrier
   during the latest Pliocene severed the Caribbean connection and
   prevented reestablishment of A. gibbosa in California waters.

AB This paper reviews the economic implications of power production in
   small island developing states (SIDS). To date electricity generation is
   primarily based on fossil fuels creating serious economic and financial
   difficulties. It is argued that renewable energy technologies (RETs)
   have the potential to undercut the cost of current modes of electricity
   generation. This is primarily due to an abundance of renewable energy
   resources and characteristics specific to SIDS that make
   fossil-fuel-based electricity production extremely expensive. However,
   this requires a change not only of energy policies but also of scope and
   structure of electricity planning. So far energy policies aiming to
   promote RETs on SIDS have neglected to study the immediate and future
   technological feasibility of such programmes. However, this has serious
   implications on the cost of electricity supply systems and need to be
   considered alongside the dynamics of energy markets to allow capturing
   economic risks and benefits also in the long term. (C) 2003 Elsevier

AB Measures of happiness are increasingly being used to inform development
   policy. This is particularly true in Melanesia where linkages between
   income and life satisfaction can be weak due to the dominance of
   semi-subsistence lifestyles. This paper examines the happiness of
   households in two Melanesian countries: Solomon Islands and Vanuatu. The
   focus is on whether the poor are less happy. Findings indicate that
   wealth, increases in earnings, relative wealth, employment, and living
   on communally owned land are positively associated with happiness.
   Household size and food insecurity have a negative association. There is
   also strong support for poor households being less happy. (C) 2014

AB A new species of lantern shark, Etmopterus robinsi, is described from
   the Caribbean Sea and western North Atlantic Ocean. Morphologically
   similar to and traditionally confused with E. hillianus (Poey, 1861), E.
   robinsi is distinguished by differences in the shape of the suprapelvic
   photophore pattern, the density and shape of dermal denticles, and the
   number of precaudal vertebral centra. It also reaches a greater maximum
   length and males achieve sexual maturity at a larger size than E.
   hillianus. The two species occupy similar geographic ranges, with E.
   robinsi generally occupying depths greater than 300 fms and E. hillianus
   usually found in shallower waters at depths of less than 350 fms.

AB This paper reports on the occurrence and abundance of 48 migrant and
   resident bird species observed in the Palau Islands of western
   Micronesia from 22 April to 17 May 2005. Species accounts are presented
   for 41 migrants, including 23 shorebirds, eight land birds, seven egrets
   and herons, and three terns and gulls, and seven resident birds,
   including four waterbirds, two passerines, and one seabird. Noteworthy
   sightings include the first record of a Richard's Pipit (Anthus
   richardi) in Micronesia, the first confirmed record of a Gray Heron
   (Ardea cinerea) in Palau, and second published records of Great Egret
   (Casmerodius alba), Striated Heron (Butorides striata), Black Kite
   (Milvus migrans), Long-toed Stint (Calidris subminuta), Whiskered Tern
   (Chlidonias hybrida), and Gray Wagtail (Motacilla cinerea) in Palau.
   Although we did not observe large numbers of any migrant, four species
   (Greater Sand-Plover (Charadrius leschenaultii), Common Sandpiper
   (Actitis hypoleucos), Sharp-tailed Sandpiper (Calidris acuminata), and
   Eastern Yellow Wagtail (Motacilla tschutschensis)) were recorded in
   greater numbers than reported at other locations in Micronesia. Among
   resident species, we counted a total of 69 Common Moorhens (Gallinula
   chloropus) at three sites, which represents by far the highest number
   ever recorded in the archipelago. No Pacific Black Ducks (Anas
   superciliosa) were sighted, confirming the rarity of this species in
   Palau. Two populations of introduced Eurasian Tree Sparrows (Passer
   montanus) totaling 62 birds were found, indicating a rapid increase in
   abundance since this species was first discovered in Palau in 2000.

AB Oceania can be characterized by a richness of culture, biodiversity and
   natural resources and a particular future that the changing climate will
   bring to islands, livelihoods and ecosystems. We reviewed literature
   detailing the limitations of siloed approaches to public health and
   conservation action for regional sustainability, highlighting
   opportunities for regional integration as place-based, through
   activities that are locally relevant, innovative engagement across a
   broader variety of sectors and working with indigenous peoples'
   knowledges. We present three case studies that extend and redefine the
   boundaries of the fields of public health and conservation, enabling
   collaborators to better respond to complex issues impacting biodiversity
   and human health. These case studies make explicit the links between
   nutrition, catchment management, water resources, fisheries, marine
   protected areas and communicable and non-communicable diseases. Public
   health and conservation are more meaningfully connected in place-based,
   reciprocal and compassionate activities, using common language to draw
   on the well-developed instruments of both sectors. These will include
   health impact assessments and combine health and ecological economics,
   which together will contribute to responding to an emergent set of
   challenges, namely human population increase, urbanization, overfishing
   and more severe aspects of climate change.

AB Describing the drivers of species loss and of community change are
   important goals in both conservation and ecology. However, it is
   difficult to determine whether exploited species decline due to direct
   effects of harvesting or due to other environmental perturbations
   brought about by proximity to human populations. Here we quantify
   differences in species richness of coral reef fish communities along a
   human population gradient in Papua New Guinea to understand the relative
   impacts of fishing and environmental perturbation. Using data from
   published species lists we categorize the reef fishes as either fished
   or non-fished based on their body size and reports from the published
   literature. Species diversity for both fished and non-fished groups
   decreases as the size of the local human population increases, and this
   relationship is stronger in species that are fished. Additionally,
   comparison of modern and museum collections show that modern reef
   communities have proportionally fewer fished species relative to 19th
   century ones. Together these findings show that the reef fish
   communities of Papua New Guinea experience multiple anthropogenic
   stressors and that even at low human population levels targeted species
   experience population declines across both time and space.

AB The island of Cuba and surrounding cays are a major repository of
   biodiversity in the Caribbean archipelago. Although Cuba is widely
   recognized for its high biodiversity and endemism, much, of the
   country's conservation experiences have been overlooked by the global
   conservation scientific community. Here we particularly highlight
   decades of governance efforts that built and strengthened forest and
   biodiversity protection policies, resulting in the second largest rate
   of forest cover recovery worldwide, doubling of both marine and
   terrestrial protected area networks in recent years, as well as
   developing a unique agroecological matrix management. These conservation
   strategies combined with the constraints on infrastructure development
   as a result of the decades long U.S. embargo, has had the indirect
   result of placing Cuba in a unique position in the Caribbean region.
   Nevertheless, despite these advances, significant part of the Cuban
   biota suffers from deforestation and habitat degradation. Major threats
   include booming tourism, spread of introduced species, climate change
   and increasing frequency and intensity of storms and hurricanes
   associated to global warming. We also point out for Cuba's future
   challenges, as well as lessons that could be applied in other tropical
   countries.

AB The tree diversity of sub-montane and lower montane primary forests is
   studied in plot-based inventories on two sites in Lore Lindu National
   Park, Central Sulawesi. Out of 166 species in total, 50 % are new
   records for Sulawesi (19 %) or the Central Sulawesi province (31 %).
   Species richness decreases with altitude. In the sub-montane forest, the
   highest Family Importance Values (FIV) are reached by the Lauraceae,
   Fagaceae, Sapotaceae, Moraceae and Euphorbiaceae. In the lower montane
   forest, the Fagaceae are of major importance (FIV 71.9), followed at
   some distance by the Myrtaceae, Elaeocarpaceae and Lauraceae. For each
   site, a group of important families is identified that is of minor
   importance or absent on the other site. The comparison of basal area
   (BA), number of species and FIV with published plot-based studies in
   sub-montane and lower montane primary forests in Malesia (Borneo,
   Sulawesi, Papua New Guinea) reveals: 1) with 35.4 and 37.1 m(2) ha(-1),
   the BA is comparable to that measured in Borneo and Papua New Guinea,
   but does not support previous findings of extremely high BA in Sulawesi
   forests; 2) species richness is comparable to that in Borneo and other
   Sulawesi forests, but lower than in Papua New Guinea; 3) decrease in
   diversity with altitude is in accordance with findings in Borneo; 4) in
   sub-montane forests, the Lauraceae are generally important; the Sulawesi
   studies are closely related to those from Papua New Guinea; 5) the lower
   montane forests have the Fagaceae and Myrtaceae as most important
   families in common.

   representing 13 species collected in 2009 and 2010 in PNG were examined
   for endoparasitic helminths. This study found mature individuals of one
   species of Digenea (Opisthioglyphe cophixali), adults of two species of
   Cestoda (Nematotaenia hylae, Cylindrotaenia sp.) and cysticerci of an
   unidentified cestode species; adults of nine species of Nematoda
   (Aplectana krausi, Bakeria bakeri, Cosmocerca novaeguineae,
   Cosmocercella phrynomantisi, Falcaustra papuensis, Icosiella papuensis,
   Ochtoterenella papuensis, Parathelandros allisoni, Parathelandros
   andersoni), and one species of Acanthocephala (cystacanths in the family
   Centrorhynchidae). There was a high degree of endemism among the
   helminth species infecting the microhylids, with 83% of the species
   known only from PNG. Yet the helminth fauna infecting Papuan microhylids
   are generalists with direct life cycles (no intermediate host) that also
   infect other anuran species. We thus conclude infection is more
   dependent upon habitat conditions than diet. Twenty-nine new host
   records are reported.

AB A small benthic chaetognath, Spadella nunezi sp. nov., living on
   organogenous sandy bottom of La Graciosa (Lanzarote, Canary Islands), is
   described. It is one of the smallest known species, and its narrow
   lateral fins, like the reduction of the pigment cell of the eyes, are
   probable indications of a more or less interstitial way of life. It is
   the third shallow benthic species known in the East side of the Atlantic
   Ocean. By comparison, the American side of this ocean has a higher
   diversity since it houses two genera and six species of benthic neritic
   chaetognaths. It is suggested that this relative richness results from
   the paleogeography, since the Caribbean Region was in relation with the
   Indo-Pacific Ocean, where the number of species is the highest in the
   world, before the erection of the Panama Isthmus.

AB This article compares literary mediations of the world-historical
   movement of cacao frontiers across the American hemisphere, and
   contrasts the imagination of food as resource and resistance in
   literature from Pablo Antonio Cuadra in Nicaragua, Samuel Selvon in
   Trinidad, Jorge Amado in Brazil and Merle Collins in Grenada. Cacao is
   considered both in terms of the energy required for its production, and
   as a high-calorie source of energetic consumption itself. The article's
   aims are twofold: to survey key aesthetic and thematic concerns of the
   literature of cacao, particularly its tendency towards irrealism when
   mediating frontier violence; and, to explore how literary critiques of
   cacao extractivism are counterposed to representations of vernacular
   foodways and social reproduction. The article concludes that the
   aesthetics of provision foods are symbolically freighted, represented as
   resourceful modes of agriculture that repudiate the undervaluing of
   human and extra-human work in plantation monoculture.

AB The energy expenditure, food consumption and anthropometry of two groups
   of Hull women are described. The group occupying the highly productive
   drained margins of the Haeapugua Swamp at Weinani have significantly
   higher intakes of energy and protein than those at Heli on the Paijaka
   Plateau. However, both groups of women expend similar amounts of time
   and energy in agricultural activities. The differences are explained by
   the contrasting quality of agricultural land at each place. Production
   per hectare at Heli is only around half of that at Weinani. It is
   concluded that the nutritional health of Heli women is compromised. This
   is probably the cause of the significantly lower mean birthweights of
   children born to women living on the Paijaka Plateau.

AB Reliable abundance estimates are critical for management and
   conservation of coastal small cetaceans. This is particularly important
   in developing countries where coastal human populations are increasing,
   the impacts of anthropogenic activities are often unknown, and the
   resources necessary to assess coastal cetaceans are limited. We adapted
   ship-based line transect methods to small-boat surveys to estimate the
   abundance of bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus) at Turneffe Atoll,
   Belize. Using a systematic survey design with random start and uniform
   coverage, 34 dolphin clusters were sighted during small-boat line
   transect surveys conducted in 2005-2006. Distance sampling methods
   estimated abundance at 216 individuals (CV = 27.7%, 95% CI = 126-370).
   Due to species rarity in the Atoll, small sample size, and potential
   violations in line transect assumptions, the estimate should be
   considered preliminary. Nevertheless, it provides up-to-date information
   on the status of a regional population in an area under increasing
   threat of habitat loss and prey depletion via uncontrolled development
   and unsustainable fishing. This information will be useful as Belize
   develops a new conservation initiative to create a comprehensive and
   resilient marine protected area system. Our study illustrates the
   application of distance sampling methods to small-boat surveys to obtain
   abundance estimates of coastal cetaceans in a region lacking resources.

AB Long dependent upon imported fossil fuels, the islands of the Caribbean
   have recently been targeted by initiatives meant to hasten a shift to
   more renewable forms of energy. In this paper, we provide an overview of
   this ongoing energy transition, focusing on the experiences of Jamaica
   and the Eastern Caribbean. To do so, we develop the concept of the
   'island energy metabolism' as a way to conceptualize relationships
   between the biophysical properties of different energy sources and the
   distinctive territorial, infrastructural and geopolitical
   characteristics of islands. We trace the development of the prevailing
   fossil fuel-based metabolism in the Caribbean region, and highlight some
   of the resulting energy dilemmas faced by island territories in the
   region. We then turn our attention to the ongoing renewable energy
   transition, focusing on the opportunities and barriers posed by islands.
   We highlight the role of island imaginaries in attracting international
   interest, and point to the ways in which island geographies can hinder
   the transition. Drawing on examples gleaned from fieldwork in the
   Caribbean, we discuss the financial, logistical and infrastructural
   challenges posed by the region's fragmented sovereignty and island
   territoriality, and suggest how a metabolism lens can shed light on the
   trajectories of low-carbon transitions.

AB Coral community shifts towards reefs dominated by stress-resistant
   corals have contributed to rapid declines in the architectural
   complexity of reefs throughout the Caribbean. Complex reef architecture
   provides important niches and refuges for many reef fishes and thus
   widespread declines in reef complexity could have important consequences
   for the structure and function of fish assemblages. We explore the
   influence of reef architecture on fish assemblages by comparing the size
   and trophic structure of reef fishes along a 20 km-long 15-reef gradient
   of coral cover, coral species dominance and architectural complexity in
   Cozumel, Mexico. Our results show that reefs with high architectural
   complexity, in particular those dominated by robust Montastraea corals,
   supported fish assemblages with larger numbers of individuals in the
   smallest size classes (<20 cm) and longer food chains (higher mean
   trophic levels). The association between coral complexity and fish
   communities is highly size-structured and is greatest for smallest size
   classes. The greater abundance of both small fish and the key early life
   stages of larger fishes on more complex reefs suggests that
   architectural complexity may influence entire reef fish assemblages,
   even though larger fish are less dependent on reef complexity. Key
   reef-building corals such as Montastraea are thus likely to be
   disproportionately important for maintaining reef fish communities, and
   shifts in Caribbean coral communities may compromise fish recruitment
   and truncate food chains, reducing resilience and inhibiting reef
   recovery from degradation.

AB The influence of the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation (AMO) produces
   pronounced regional variability in drought over the Caribbean, Central
   America and equatorial South America area. Through spatial statistical
   analyses, we identified a marked dichotomy between drought values of the
   Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI) in northern
   Mexico and equatorial South America as a function of the AMO. The
   relationship is such that significant negative correlations between the
   drought index and phase of the AMO are identified for northern Mexico
   and on the Atlantic side of Central America. This indicates that drought
   (negative values of the SPEI) episodes are linked to the positive phase
   of the AMO. Alternately, there are high positive correlations between
   the AMO and on the Pacific side of Central America, the Caribbean and
   mainly in the northern South American area closest to the equator.
   Although many potential causes have been proposed in explanation of
   precipitation variability over the region, this geographic dichotomy
   suggests that movement of the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) may
   play a significance role. The heightened vulnerability of the developing
   nations in this region to drought episodes makes forecasting droughts of
   great importance. These nations are greatly dependent on water intensive
   industries to maintain economic development. Thus, the findings of this
   research can assist in informing drought preparedness strategies to
   mitigate significant losses due to drought.

   islands, is a region of general biogeographical interest in view of the
   uniqueness of its flora and fauna. This paper presents a comprehensive
   review of the Simuliidae in the region, and is the first faunistic
   record of blackflies from Bioko. Simuliidae (larvae, pupae and neonate
   adults) were collected from Bioko and from around Mount Cameroon and
   compared with previous findings from Mount Cameroon, Principe and Sao
   Tome. Twenty-seven species are known from the region. Twenty-five
   species have been recorded around Mount Cameroon, eight species on
   Bioko, three species on Sao Tome and one species on Principe. Two
   taxonomic 'forms' (one on Bioko alone, and one on both Bioko and around
   Mount Cameroon) and one species (found only on Sao Tome ) are endemic to
   the region. A study of the variation in the morphology of Simulium
   cervicornutum revealed two morphotypes, one from Bioko and around Mount
   Cameroon and the other from the rest of Africa. The speciation and
   biogeography of the Simuliidae in the Gulf of Guinea are discussed.

AB During a survey of the zooplankton community of a protected reef system
   on the southern coast of the Mexican Caribbean, many female and male
   specimens of an undescribed species of Caligus Muller, 1785 were
   collected. The new species closely resembles C. wilsoni Delamare
   Deboutteville & Nunez-Ruivo, 1958 and C. belones (Kroyer, 1863) and has
   affinities with C. balistae Steenstrup & Lutken, 1861 and C. longipedis
   Bassett-Smith, 1898, all known from the Caribbean Sea and adjacent
   waters of the north-western Atlantic Ocean. Caligus ilhoikimi sp. nov.,
   is described in full and illustrations of both sexes are also provided.
   The new species differs from C. wilsoni and C. belones in several
   features, including the shape of the sternal furca, the shape and
   proportions of the genital complex and abdomen, the lack of accessory
   processes on the distal elements of leg 1 exopod, and the presence of a
   lateral spine on the third exopodal segment of leg 2. This is the
   seventh species of Caligus known from waters of the Atlantic seaboard of
   Mexico and the 32nd species of the genus recorded in Mexican waters. The
   specimens were caught with a plankton light trap. The unusually high
   number of individuals captured and the fact that the sample was
   monospecific (i.e. only adults of this caligid species were collected)
   suggests that it is a chiefly planktonic form. This is a mode of life
   recently revealed as being more common among caligids than previously
   thought.

AB Seasonally stratified analyses of rainfall anomalies over the
   intra-Americas sea and surrounding land areas and of onset and end dates
   of the Central American rainy season show that the variability of the
   tropical Atlantic sea surface temperature anomaly (SSTA) is more
   strongly associated with rainfall over the Caribbean and Central America
   than is tropical eastern Pacific SSTA. Seasonal differences include the
   importance of antisymmetric configurations of tropical Atlantic SSTA in
   the dry season but not in the rainy season. Both oceans are related to
   rainfall, but the strength of the rainfall response appears to depend on
   how SSTA in the tropical Atlantic and eastern Pacific combine. The
   strongest response occurs when the tropical Atlantic is in the
   configuration of a meridional dipole (antisymmetric across the ITCZ) and
   the eastern tropical Pacific is of opposite sign to the tropical North
   Atlantic. When the tropical North Atlantic and tropical Pacific are of
   the same sign, the rainfall response is weaker. The rainy season in
   lower Central America tends to start early and end late in years that
   begin with warm SSTs in the tropical North Atlantic, and the end dates
   are also delayed when the eastern equatorial Pacific is cool. This
   enhancement of date departures for zonally antisymmetric configurations
   of SSTA between the North Atlantic and Pacific is qualitatively
   consistent with;he results for rainfall anomalies.

   3. Life spans varied from 40 to 250 days and were positively correlated

AB In Papua New Guinea the population is growing faster than the area under
   cultivation. As a result, land use is being intensified and soil
   nutrient depletion may occur, resulting in nutrient deficiencies of
   agricultural crops. This paper reviews nutrient deficiencies in the
   agricultural crops of Papua New Guinea using the literature on agronomic
   trials, expert knowledge and Geographical Information System (GIS) soil
   fertility databases. One of the aims of this overview is to discuss the
   spatial distribution of common nutrient deficiencies, which will
   facilitate the formulation of future strategies on integrated nutrient
   management research. Nutrient deficiencies have been investigated
   systematically since the mid-1950s. Research has mainly focused on
   export tree crops, and relatively little information is available on
   food crops. Literature analysis and expert knowledge showed consistent
   trends with deficiencies of B and P in large parts of the highlands. GIS
   soil fertility databases confirm these observations. The authors' method
   has been shown to be useful in delineating areas in which nutrient
   deficiencies occur, and these findings could be used for the planning of
   nutrient management research and extension activities.

AB Neotropical skinks are unique among lizards and other vertebrates in
   their degree of convergence, in reproductive traits, with eutherian
   mammals. They have also been famously difficult to classify into
   species, largely because of a conservative body plan and paucity of
   conventional diagnostic characters. Currently there are 26 recognized
   species, six of which occur only on Caribbean islands. All are placed in
   a single genus, Mabuya. We conducted a systematic revision of
   Neotropical skinks using both conventional and unconventional
   morphological characters, supplemented by DNA sequence analyses. We
   define 61 species grouped into 16 clades, recognized here as genera.
   They include three available generic names (Copeoglossum, Mabuya, and
   Spondylurus) and 13 new genera: Alinea gen. nov., Aspronema gen. nov.,
   Brasiliscincus gen. nov., Capitellum gen. nov., Exila gen. nov.,
   Manciola gen. nov., Maracaiba gen. nov., Marisora gen. nov., c gen.
   nov., Orosaura gen. nov., Panopa gen. nov., Psychosaura gen. nov., and
   Varzea gen. nov. These 16 genera of skinks form a monophyletic group and
   are placed in the Subfamily Mabuyinae of the skink Family Mabuyidae. Six
   other skink families are recognized: Acontidae, Egerniidae,
   Eugongylidae, Lygosomidae, Scincidae, and Sphenomorphidae. We describe
   three new subfamilies of Mabuyidae: Chioniniinae subfam. nov., Dasiinae

   nov. Of the 61 total species of mabuyine skinks, 39 occur on Caribbean
   islands, 38 are endemic to those islands, and 33 of those occur in the
   West Indies. Most species on Caribbean islands are allopatric,
   single-island endemics, although three species are known from
   Hispaniola, three from St. Thomas, and two from Culebra, St. Croix, Salt
   Island, Martinique, the southern Lesser Antilles, Trinidad, and Tobago.
   Co-occurring species typically differ in body size and belong to
   different genera. Three ecomorphs are described to account for
   associations of ecology and morphology: terrestrial, scansorial, and
   cryptozoic. Parturition occurs at the transition between the dry and wet
   seasons, and the number of young (1-7) is correlated with body size and
   taxonomic group. Molecular phylogenies indicate the presence of many
   unnamed species in Middle and South America.
   A molecular timetree shows that mabuyines dispersed from Africa to South
   America 18 (25-9) million years ago, and that diversification occurred
   initially in South America but soon led to colonization of Caribbean
   islands and Middle America. The six genera present on Caribbean islands
   each represent separate dispersals, over water, from the mainland during
   the last 10 million years. Considerable dispersal and speciation also
   occurred on and among Caribbean islands, probably enhanced by
   Pleistocene glacial cycles and their concomitant sea level changes.
   Based on IUCN Redlist criteria, all of the 38 endemic Caribbean island
   species are threatened with extinction. Twenty-seven species (71%) are
   Critically Endangered, six species (16%) are Endangered, and five
   species (13%) are Vulnerable. Sixteen of the Critically Endangered
   species are extinct, or possibly extinct, because of human activities
   during the last two centuries. Several of the surviving species are near
   extinction and in need of immediate protection. Analysis of collection
   records indicates that the decline or loss of 14 skink species can be
   attributed to predation by the Small Indian Mongoose. That invasive
   predator was introduced as a biological control of rats in sugar cane
   fields in the late nineteenth century (1872-1900), immediately resulting
   in a mass extinction of skinks and other reptiles. The ground-dwelling
   and diurnal habits of skinks have made them particularly susceptible to
   mongoose predation.

AB As rates of global warming increase rapidly, identifying species at risk
   of decline due to climate impacts and the factors affecting this risk
   have become key challenges in ecology and conservation biology. Here, we
   present a framework for assessing three components of climate-related
   risk for species: vulnerability, exposure and hazard. We used the
   relationship between the observed response of species to climate change
   and a set of intrinsic traits (e.g. weaning age) and extrinsic factors
   (e.g. precipitation seasonality within a species geographic range) to
   predict, respectively, the vulnerability and exposure of all
   data-sufficient terrestrial non-volant mammals (3,953 species).
   Combining this information with hazard (the magnitude of projected
   climate change within a species geographic range), we identified global
   hotspots of species at risk from climate change that includes the
   western Amazon basin, south-western Kenya, north-eastern Tanzania,
   north-eastern South Africa, Yunnan province in China, and mountain
   chains in Papua-New Guinea. Our framework identifies priority areas for
   monitoring climate change effects on species and directing climate
   mitigation actions for biodiversity.

AB Kuphus polythalamius (Teredinidae) is one of the world's largest, most
   rarely observed, and least understood bivalves. Kuphus polythalamius is
   also among the few shallow-water marine species and the only teredinid
   species determined to harbor sulfur-oxidizing chemoautotrophic
   (thioautotrophic) symbionts. Until the recent discovery of living
   specimens in the Philippines, this species was known only from
   calcareous hard parts, fossils, and the preserved soft tissues of a
   single large specimen. As a result, the anatomy, biology, life history,
   and geographic range of K. polythalamius remain obscure. Here we report
   the collection and description of the smallest living specimens of K.
   polythalamius yet discovered and confirm the species identity of these
   individuals by using sequences of three genetic markers. Unlike
   previously collected specimens, all of which have been reported to occur
   in marine sediments, these specimens were observed burrowing in wood,
   the same substrate utilized by all other members of the family. These
   observations suggest that K. polythalamius initially settles on wood and
   subsequently transitions into sediment, where this species may grow to
   enormous sizes. This discovery led us to search for and find previously
   unidentified and misidentified wood-boring specimens of this species
   within museum collections, and it allowed us to show that the recent
   geographic range (since 1933) of this species extends across a 3000-mile
   span from the Philippines to Papua New Guinea and the Solomon Islands.

AB Islands are known to be vulnerable to natural hazards, resulting in
   substantial risks for their tourism industries. To facilitate the
   systematic analysis of the underlying vulnerability drivers, a tourism
   disaster vulnerability framework was developed. The conceptual model
   then guided qualitative empirical research in three regions: the
   Caribbean, the South Pacific, and the Indian Ocean. The results from 73
   interviews highlight common, as well as idiosyncratic, factors that
   shape the islands' hazardscapes and vulnerabilities. Key vulnerabilities
   included social, economic, political, and environmental dimensions.
   Probably, the most critical vulnerability driver is the lack of private
   sector investment in disaster risk reduction. This is interrelated with
   deficient planning processes, on-going demand for coastal products, lack
   of political will, and poor environmental conditions. Notwithstanding
   many barriers, some businesses and organisations engage proactively in
   addressing disaster risk. The paper's empirical evidence supports the
   validity of the framework, and suggestions for further research are
   made.

AB Invasive lionfish pose an unprecedented threat to biodiversity and
   fisheries throughout Atlantic waters off of the southeastern United
   States, the Caribbean, and the Gulf of Mexico. Here, we employ a
   spatially replicated Before-After-Control-Impact analysis with temporal
   pairing to quantify for the first time the impact of the lionfish
   invasion on native fish abundance across a broad regional scale and over
   the entire duration of the lionfish invasion (1990-2014). Our results
   suggest that 1) lionfish-impacted areas off of the southeastern United
   States are most prevalent off-shore near the continental shelf-break but
   are also common near-shore and 2) in impacted areas, lionfish have
   reduced tomtate (a native forage fish) abundance by 45% since the
   invasion began. Tomtate served as a model native fish species in our
   analysis, and as such, it is likely that the lionfish invasion has had
   similar impacts on other species, some of which may be of economic
   importance. Barring the development of a control strategy that reverses
   the lionfish invasion, the abundance of lionfish in the Atlantic,
   Caribbean, and Gulf of Mexico will likely remain at or above current
   levels. Consequently, the effect of lionfish on native fish abundance
   will likely continue for the foreseeable future.

AB We report the results of 42 point-counts of landbirds in five types of
   habitat on Lakeba, Lau Group, Fiji, during 9-15 May 1999. The relative
   abundance and species richness were greatest in mid-/late-successional
   limestone forest, the habitat type least modified by humans. This was
   due mainly to an increased presence of four columbids (Gallicolumba
   stairi, Ptilinopus perousii, FI porphyraceus and Ducula pacifica) and
   two passerine insectivores (Mayrornis lessoni and Myiagra vanikorensis).
   By contrast, the relative abundance of two passerine nectarivores
   (Myzomela jugularis and Foulehaio carunculata) was greatest in disturbed
   habitats with many coconut trees. Most species of landbirds on Lakeba
   also occur in Tonga and/or Samoa, where methodologically similar surveys
   have taken place. The combined data indicate that the relative abundance
   and habitat association of some widespread West Polynesian species, such
   as Lalage maculosa, Aplonis tabuensis and Foulehaio carunculata, vary
   dramatically from island to island, both between and within island
   groups. Other species, such as Ducula pacifica, Ptilinopus parphyraceus
   and Halcyon chloris, occur across West Polynesia in much more
   predictable patterns.

   Fl Socorro, Trinidad, were most effective against Aedes aegypti but not
   against Culex quinquefasciatus. Mesocyclops longisetus and Me.
   aspericornis prevented any mosquito survival over 25 wk of observation
   despite weekly challenges with Ae. aegypti. The copepods were tolerant
   to dosages of the insecticide temephos that are usually toxic to
   mosquito larvae. This indicated that copepods could be incorporated into

   might be introduced with copepods into drinking water, microbial studies
   were done on the copepods. These showed the presence of only Aeromonas
   sobria, Pseudomonas sp., Alcalignes sp., and gram-positive bacilli.
   Although none of these are highly pathogenic to humans, the application
   of these copepods has not yet been recommended for use in drinking

AB Climate variability associated with the El Nino Southern Oscillation
   (ENSO) results in large sea-surface temperature (SST) and sea-surface
   salinity (SSS) anomalies in many regions of the tropical Pacific Ocean.
   We investigate interannual changes in SSS driven by ENSO in the
   southwestern Pacific at Sabine Bank, Vanuatu (SBV, 166.04 degrees E,
   15.94 degrees S) using monthly variations in coral delta O-18 from 1842
   to 2007 CE. We develop and apply a coral delta O-18-SSS transfer
   function, which is assessed using a calibration-verification exercise
   (1970-2007 CE). The 165-year reconstructed SSS record contains a
   prominent trend toward freshening from 1842 to 2007 CE; mean SSS for
   1842-1872 CE is 35.46 +/- 0.28 psu, which contrasts with a mean value of
   34.85 +/- 0.31 psu for 1977-2007 CE, with a freshening trend during the
   latter part of the 20th century that is not unprecedented with respect
   to the overall record. Variance in the record is concentrated in the
   interannual (42%) and interdecadal (29%) bands. The SBV-SSS record
   matches well with a similarly reconstructed SSS time series at Malo
   Channel, Vanuatu, which is located similar to 120 km to the east of SBV.
   This regional signal is likely driven by ENSO-related changes in the
   SPCZ and interdecadal changes in surface water advection. The pattern of
   interdecadal variability at SBV agrees reasonably well with coral
   records of interdecadal variability from Fiji and Tonga, especially in
   the pre-1940 portions of the records, further evidence for the regional
   extent of the salinity signal at Sabine Bank, Vanuatu.

AB In the absence of a proper definition based on comprehensive anatomical
   investigations, the genus Fluviopupa Pilsbry, 1911 has been used for
   hydrobioid gastropods from several continental regions and oceanic
   islands in the southwest and south Pacific. The type species F. pupoidea
   Pilsbry, 1911 was the only hydrobioid gastropod known from Fiji to date.
   In this paper we provide descriptions of shell, operculum, radula and
   anatomy of 10 species of Fluviopupa from Fiji including the type
   species. This and seven other species occur on Viti Levu. The remaining
   two species were found on Vanua Levu. The high diversity is not
   surprising considering similar distribution and diversity patterns of
   spring and stream-dwelling hydrobioid gastropods in other parts of the
   world. Based on geology, geography and comparative anatomy, we
   hypothesize that the ancestor of the Fijian taxa was likely a freshwater
   species sharing a common ancestor with extant taxa in either New
   Caledonia or New Zealand. The islands of Vanuatu may have served as
   stepping stones.

   play important roles in geochemical cycles and climate. They are a
   particularly dominant group in oligotrophic waters, yet a lot more needs
   to be learned about their horizontal and vertical distributions.
   Coccolithophores were collected at different photic depths from 15
   stations across the Caribbean Sea during cruise 35/1 of the RV Meteor
   from April to May 1996. A total of 67 species was identified, with an
   average of 19 species per station. Coccolithophores were encountered at
   nearly all stations but abundances were fairly low (10(2)-10(3) cells
   l(-1)). Coccolithophore assemblages in the four oceanographical
   provinces identified (Granada Basin waters, Atlantic surface waters,
   northern Caribbean waters, and Pedro Bank waters) differed in their
   species composition and abundances. Abundance peaks occurred near the
   surface and in. the deeper photic zone (140-150 in) just below the deep
   chlorophyll-a maximum at the top of the nitrate nutricline.

AB The family Chasmocarcinidae Serene, 1964, is revised based on the
   examination of the type material of many of its species as well as
   unidentified and previously identified material from around the world.
   The revised family now consists of three subfamilies comprising 16
   genera (including eight described as new) and 51 species (including 19
   described as new). The subfamily Chasmocarciinae Serene, 1964, consists
   of Amboplax n. gen. with one species; Angustopelta n. gen. with four
   species, two of which are new; Camatopsis Alcock & Anderson, 1899, with
   six species, five of which are new; Chasmocarcinops Alcock, 1900, with
   one species; Chasmocarcinus Rathbun, 1898, with 11 species, one of which
   is new; Chinommatia n. gen. with five species, two of which are new;
   Deltopelta n. gen. with one species; Hephthopelta Alcock, 1899, with two
   species, one of which is new; Microtopsis Komai, Ng & Yamada, 2012, with
   two species, one of which is new; Notopelta n. gen. with one species;
   Statommatia n. gen. with five species, two of which are new; and
   Tenagopeltan. gen. with three species, two of which are new. The
   subfamily Megaesthesiinae Stevcic, 2005, consists of Alainthesiusn. gen.
   with two species, both of which are new; Megaesthesius Rathbun, 1909,
   with four species, one of which is new. The subfamily Trogloplacinae
   Guinot, 1986, consists of Australocarcinus Davie, 1988, with three
   species, and Trogloplax Guinot, 1986, with one species. A neotype is
   selected for Chasmocarcinus cylindricus Rathbun, 1901. Three nominal
   species were found to be junior subjective synonyms of other species:
   Chasmocarcinus panamensis Serene, 1964, of C. longipes Garth, 1940;
   Chasmocarcinus rathbuni Bouvier, 1917, of C. typicus Rathbun, 1898; and
   Hephthopelta superbaBoone, 1927, of Deltopelta obliqua (Rathbun, 1898).
   Thirteen chasmocarcinid genera are exclusively found in the Indo-West
   Pacific region, one (Chasmocarcinus) in both the Western Atlantic and
   Tropical Eastern Pacific regions, and two (Deltopelta n. gen. and
   Amboplax n. gen.) exclusively in the Western Atlantic. Chasmocarcinids
   are remarkable for occurring from depths exceeding 1000 m to shallow
   water and completely freshwater habitats: chasmocarcinines and
   megaesthesiines are found from shallow to deep water marine ecosystems,
   whereas trogloplacines live in freshwater streams, including cave
   systems.

AB Seaweed extracts are commonly used as phytoelicitors to promote crop
   growth and yield, worldwide. However, extracts of some seaweed species
   are known to induce defence processes in plants and may have potential
   for use as plant protection agents in the management of crop diseases.
   Most of the research on seaweed extracts as elicitors of plant defences
   have been on temperate seaweed species. Caribbean islands have an
   abundance of tropical seaweed species along their coasts, but their
   potential for use in agriculture has not been explored yet. The aim of
   this study was to determine the phytoelicitor potential of extracts of
   three seaweeds abundantly found in Trinidad and the southern Caribbean.
   The efficacy of the seaweed extracts in suppressing Alternaria solani
   and Xanthomonas campestris pv vesicatoria infections in tomato was
   analysed. Alkaline extracts of Ulva lactuca, Sargassum filipendula and
   Gelidium serrulatum were applied to tomato plants which were inoculated
   with the pathogens. The plants were then monitored over time for
   development of disease, activity of defence enzymes and expression
   levels of key marker genes of various plant defence pathways. Plants
   treated with the seaweed extracts showed reduced disease severity which
   was coupled with elevated rates of activities of defence enzymes.
   Seaweed extract-treated plants also had increased expression levels of
   marker genes for defence signalling pathways. The extracts of U. lactuca
   and S. filipendula induced jasmonate signalling defence systems.
   However, G. serrulatum extract was able to sequentially induce both
   salicylic acid and jasmonate signalling pathways and, consequently found
   to be very effective in controlling the intensity of both diseases. The
   results of this study indicate that extracts made from tropical seaweeds
   found locally in the southern Caribbean could be used in tomato as
   phytoelicitors. Local seaweed extracts therefore present a good,
   potentially environmentally friendly, alternative for farmers of the
   Southern Caribbean to manage diseases caused by A. solani and X.
   vesicatoria in tomato.

AB Scarce resources and competing land-use goals necessitate efficient
   biodiversity conservation. Combining multicriteria analysis with
   conservation decision-support tools improves efficiency of conservation
   planning by maximizing outcomes for biodiversity while minimizing
   opportunity costs to society. An opportunity cost is the benefit that
   could have been received by taking an alternative course of action
   (i.e., costs to society of protecting an area for biodiversity rather
   than developing it for some other use). Although different ways of
   integrating multiple opportunity costs into conservation planning have
   been suggested, there have been no tests as to which method is most
   efficient. We compared the relative efficiency of 3 such procedures
   (Faith & Walker [1996], Sarkar et al. [2004], and a procedure of our own
   design) in a systematic conservation-planning framework for the Milne
   Bay Province of Papua New Guinea. We devised 14 opportunity costs and
   assigned these to 3 scenarios representing different conservation
   planning concerns: food security, macro-economic development, and
   biodiversity persistence. For each scenario, we compared the efficiency
   of the 3 methods in terms of amount of biodiversity protected relative
   to total expenditure for each opportunity cost. All 3 methods captured
   similar amounts of biodiversity, but differed in total cost. Our method
   had the least overall cost and was therefore most efficient.
   Nevertheless, there was a high correlation and geographical concordance
   among all 3 methods, indicating a high degree of spatial overlap. This
   suggests that choosing an appropriate approach may often depend on
   contextual factors related to the design of the planning question,
   rather than efficiency alone.

AB Eutrophication from a variety of anthropogenic sources is an
   increasingly prevalent problem in coastal waters, and is one of the
   factors contributing to the decline of seagrass ecosystems worldwide.
   This study investigated the impact of natural nutrient enrichment
   derived from nesting seabird colonies on Man O'War Cay, Belize, on the
   epiphytic foraminiferal communities living on the seagrass Thalasssia
   testudinum. Man O'War Cay, a small mangrove island in the central region
   of the barrier reef complex, hosts nesting colonies of magnificent
   frigate birds and brown boobies. Epiphytic foraminiferans were surveyed
   from five stations spaced at 10-m intervals along a 40-m transect in a
   seagrass meadow located off the eastern end of the island (March 2004).
   Low species diversity and high dominance of the encrusting, dendritic
   species Cornuspiramia antillarum characterized the epiphytic
   foraminiferal biota. Species diversity, as measured by the Shannon's H,
   and evenness, as measured by Buzas-Gibson's E, decreased in an offshore
   direction. The density of individuals per square centimeter of blade,
   however, increased in an offshore direction, with the lowest values
   observed at the station closest to the island, and the highest values
   recorded at the station farthest from the shore. The results obtained in
   this study indicate that epiphytic foraminiferal populations respond to
   nutrient enrichment, and thus may be useful indicators of ecosystem
   decline in subtropical-tropical, oligotrophic marine habitats.

AB At present, the Ramu River in Papua New Guinea flows directly into the
   Bismarck Sea, while the adjacent Keram flows into the Sepik River. There
   is evidence to suggest that the Ramu previously occupied the existing
   Keram water course, and has been gradually diverting its discharge into
   its present channel, probably over the last 4,000 years. The diversion
   process is not complete yet, and during the wet season flood water still
   travels across these two rivers. The most direct evidence to support
   this proposal of river diversion is that there are much larger meander
   bends on which the existing Keram stream channel is superimposed. The
   diversion of the Ramu is believed to be a result of relative sea-level
   rise in the late Quaternary which altered the gradients of the Keram and
   Ramu rivers, and may have been facilitated through neo-tectonic movement
   of the floodplain.

AB The foraminiferal communities of Caroni Swamp and Claxton Bay (W
   Trinidad, SE Caribbean Sea) were monitored monthly for two and one
   years, respectively, from March 2011 to July 2013. The foraminiferal
   assemblages of Caroni Swamp were previously examined in May 2006, when
   the assemblages occupied Zones I, II and constrained by high, mid and
   lower elevations relative to the tidal frame. Q-mode cluster analyses of
   the total (live + dead) foraminiferal recovery from stations sampled at
   Caroni Swamp and Claxton Bay were performed in conjunction with that of
   stations sampled at Caroni Swamp in 2006, in separate analyses for each
   sample occasion. The stations that clustered in Zones I, II and III
   changed between sample occasions, which indicated species moved between
   stations and elevations of a sample site, and this often coincided with
   seasonal change. Seasonal flooding would cause the tidal range to extend
   landward during the wet season and regress during the dry season.
   Seasonal movement of foraminiferal assemblages cause dead tests to mix
   across zones. Therefore, the foraminiferal assemblages at Caroni Swamp
   and Claxton Bay did not show a clear vertical zonation that was fixed
   over time.
