AB The relationship between climatic periods and intensity of 2 upwelling
   cores located in the Colombian Caribbean from the time analysis of
   climatic indicators and sea surface temperature (SST) for the period
   1990-2009 were analyzed. Four climatic seasons are described for this
   region with differences and similarities between points located in front
   of the Guajira Peninsula and Tayrona National Natural Park (PNNT).
   Spectral analysis of the Ekman transport and differences of SST with the
   furthest points of the coast estimates, as indicators of the wind stress
   and the magnitude of the upwelling along the studied period, allow
   establishing a direct correspondence between the season and the
   upwelling regime. In the case of surface water off the Guajira
   Peninsula, there are some oscillations periods that not correspond with
   wind regime in the area. These oscillations could be influenced by the
   behavior of the Caribbean Current and/or upwelling cores off Venezuela
   and/or Trinidad and Tobago. According to the spectral and descriptive
   analysis applied to ERA Interim data, these reflect well the behavior of
   the climate in the area, despite their low temporal and spatial
   resolution.

AB Since the establishment of oil palm land settlement schemes (LSSs) in
   West New Britain Province, Papua New Guinea, the settler population has
   increased significantly as second-generation settlers marry and raise
   families on their parents' blocks. We explore how settlers are
   responding to demographic and socio-economic change in an environment in
   which opportunities for land-use change are limited. In the context of
   rising population pressure, LSS smallholders are developing innovative
   livelihood strategies by pursuing non-farm income sources, increasing
   food production, acquiring additional land and migration. The type of
   migration or land accumulation strategy depends on household access to
   various resources, especially social and kinship networks, and capital.
   Agricultural extension and rural development policies have not yet
   responded to this socio-agronomic transformation. We conclude that
   economic diversification amongst smallholders creates new opportunities
   for the oil palm industry to formulate more innovative and sustainable
   policies that strengthen the oil palm industry in PNG while facilitating
   broad-based rural development. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

AB The vulnerability of tourism-dependent communities, coastal tourism
   facilities, and beaches to climate change demands the use of measures
   that can urgently minimise vulnerability and in the long term achieve
   sustainable development. This paper makes policy recommendations to
   address climate change and sea level rise challenges in small island
   developing states. Using Barbados as a case study, the paper found that
   innovations in policies and projects have offset the past ills of mass
   tourism and fortuitously now serve as pre-emptive measures in adapting
   to climate change. The array of methods for combating these changes
   includes physical planning policies, integrated coastal zone management,
   and infrastructure projects. Among the key areas for policy innovation
   are the adoption of protection, accommodation, and retreat strategies,
   which are informed by rigorous cost-benefit analysis and stakeholder
   consultation. Ecosystem-based adaptation to climate change is also
   necessary, especially for islands where coral reef protection is urgent.
   Moreover, policy adjustments are required on building construction,
   water resources management, sewage treatment, coastal zone management,
   physical planning, and land management. Institutional constraints,
   including the lack of capacity to implement, monitor, and enforce
   measures, must also be addressed if progress is to be made in adapting
   to climate change. A major conclusion is that the severity of coastal
   damage, the importance of tourism to sustainable development, and the
   country's adaptive capacity play a key part in the selection and
   implementation of climate change adaptation measures.

AB Papua New Guinea, (PNG) is situated in the South Pacific between 2
   degrees and 12 degrees South latitude and 141o and 156 degrees East
   longitude. Several islands constitute 20 provinces and 67% of the land
   is hilly with steep slope. There is a diverse climatic condition
   prevalent from lowlands to highlands region of Papua New Guinea. The
   temperature in the lowlands is always between 30 to 36 degrees C with
   high humidity of about 70 to 90%. Rice production is relatively a new
   venture in PNG and majority of rice consumed in the country is imported
   from elsewhere. However, many subsistence farmers are growing rice on a
   limited scale. There is a growing tendency among the farmers to take the
   paddy rice for milling after harvesting and threshing. But rice mills
   are not readily available. Thus, paddy-rice has to be stored both for
   milling at a later stage or for seed purposes.
   A study was conducted on storage of rice using indoor storage-structures
   for subsistence farmers. Six storage structures namely, metal bins,
   cement plastered bins, mud plastered bins, bamboo strip plain bins,
   polythene bags and copra bags were used to store TCS-10 variety of
   paddy-rice. The capacity of each structure was about 75 kg. The
   paddy-rice was stored for 148 days and the suitability of each type of
   structure was observed and related data were analysed. The cement
   plastered and mud plastered bins were the most suitable for storage of
   paddy-rice in the hot and humid region of Papua New Guinea.

AB The eastern half of the island of New Guinea (85% of total area); the
   Bismarck, Trobriand, Louisiade, and D'Entrecasteaux Archipelagos; and
   Bougainville, Buka, and Woodlark islands constitute the predominantly
   mountainous country of Papua New Guinea.  It is located 160 km northeast
   of Australia in the South Pacific Ocean.  This tropical country has 2
   monsoon seasons with average annual rainfall ranging from 200-250 cm. 
   It has 1 of the most heterogenous populations in the world with as many
   as several 1000 separate communities.  Only 650 languages have yet been
   identified with 160 of them totally unrelated to each other or to any
   other language.  At different times in its history, the country (or
   parts thereof) has been under the control of Germany, Australia (its
   largest bilateral aid donor), Japan, and Britain.  After independence in
   1975, Papua New Guinea established a veritable and strong parliamentary
   democracy.  This democracy has an excellent human rights record and has
   a clear respect for these rights.  75% of the population live
   predominately at subsistence level.  Gross domestic product (GDP)
   increased about 2%/year during the 1980s with agriculture making up 35%
   of GDP (40% of exports) and mining (copper and gold) 15%.  In 1989,
   exports included 40% of GDP.  Other than mining, the industrial sector
   made up 9% of GDP with little contributing to exports.  Food processing
   was the fastest growing segment of the industrial segment.  45% of
   agricultural production consisted of subsistence cultivation.  Coffee
   and cocoa were the 2 leading cash crops.  Financially, the country was
   sound in 1989 with exports and imports almost equal from 1986.  The
   United States relationship with Papua New Guinea is friendly and the 2
   countries have a good trade relationship.

AB The green turtle, Chelonia mydas, is a circumglobal species and a
   primary herbivore in marine ecosystems. Overexploitation as a food
   resource for human populations has resulted in drastic declines or
   extinction of green turtle populations in the Greater Caribbean,
   Attempts to manage the remaining populations on a sustainable basis are
   hampered by insufficient knowledge of demographic parameters, In
   particular, compensatory responses resulting from density-dependent
   effects have not been evaluated for any sea turtle population and thus
   have not been explicitly included in any population models.
   Growth rates of immature green turtles were measured during an 18-yr
   study in Union Creek, a wildlife reserve in the southern Bahamas, We
   have evaluated the growth data for both straight carapace length (SCL)
   and body mass with nonparametric regression models that had one response
   variable (absolute growth rate) and five potential covariates: sex,
   site, year, mean size, and recapture interval. The SCL model of
   size-specific growth rates was a good fit to the data and accounted for
   59% of the variance. The body-mass model was not a good fit to the data,
   accounting for only 26% of the variance, In the SCL model, sex, site,
   year, and mean size all had significant effects, whereas recapture
   interval did not.
   We used results of the SCL model to evaluate a density-dependent effect
   on somatic growth rates. Over the 18 yr of our study, relative
   population density underwent a sixfold increase followed by a threefold
   decrease in Union Creek as a result of natural immigration and
   emigration. Three lines of evidence support a density-dependent effect.
   First, there is a significant inverse correlation between population
   density and mean annual growth rate, Second, the condition index
   (mass/(SCL)(3)) of green turtles in Union Creek is positively correlated
   with mean annual growth rates and was negatively correlated with
   population density, indicating that the green turtles were nutrient
   limited during periods of low growth and high population densities.
   Third, the population in Union Creek fluctuated around carrying capacity
   during our study and thus was at levels likely to experience
   density-dependent effects that could be measured.
   We estimate the carrying capacity of pastures of the seagrass Thalassia
   testudinum, the major diet plant of the green turtle, as a range from
   122 to 4439 kg green turtles/ha or 16-586 million 50-kg green turtles in
   the Caribbean. Because green turtle populations are probably regulated
   by food limitation under natural conditions, carrying capacity can serve
   as a baseline to estimate changes in green turtle populations in the
   Caribbean since pre-Columbian times and to set a goal for recovery for
   these depleted populations.
   Finally, we compare the growth functions for green turtle populations in
   the Atlantic and Pacific oceans. Not only does the form of the
   size-specific growth functions differ between the two regions (monotonic
   declining in the Atlantic and nonmonotonic in the Pacific), but also
   small juvenile green turtles in the Atlantic have substantially higher
   growth rates than those in the Pacific. Research is needed to evaluate
   the causes of these differences, but our results indicate that
   demographic parameters between ocean basins should only be extrapolated
   with great caution.

AB Tropical plant species have been the focus of considerable attention in
   regard to their potential economic and social importance in the face of
   rapidly diminishing biodiversity in the tropics. Pacific Island species
   represent an even more fragile resource because different island
   populations are widely scattered and overall population sizes are small.
   We examined the distribution of genetic variation in Campnosperma
   brevipetiolata (Anacardiaceae), an upland rainforest tree species that
   is of potential use for both lumber and reforestation efforts in the
   Federated States of Micronesia (FSM). Seeds were collected from multiple
   populations on four island groups in the Caroline Islands (Kosrae,
   Pohnpei, and Yap in the FSM; and the Republic of Palau) and subjected to
   an electrophoretic analysis involving four polymorphic genetic loci. We
   hypothesized that variation on these islands would decrease with
   increasing distance from the presumed Indo-Malayan source of these
   island floras. Indeed, we found a trend of decreasing variation from
   west to east indicated by the mean number of alleles per locus (A =
   1.50-1.33), effective number of alleles per locus (A(e) = 1.14-1.12) and
   mean genetic diversity (H-e = 0.123-0.107). We also found little genetic
   differentiation among the islands (F-pt = 0.174) and among
   subpopulations within islands (F-sp = 0.047), indicating that either
   there are high levels of gene flow among the islands by seed dispersal
   or that these populations have not been established long enough for
   divergence to have occurred. The lack of divergence among islands
   observed for Campnosperma brevipetiolata suggests that germplasm sampled
   from any one island population would be a suitable starting point for
   plant breeding or reforestation efforts.

AB Areas where CO2-enriched gases discharge into shallow-marine
   environments can serve as natural laboratories to study the effects of
   elevated pCO(2) (i.e., ocean acidification) on benthic communities.
   Hydrothermal vents in Tutum Bay, Ambitle Island, Papua New Guinea, occur
   at depths of 10 m and are surrounded by a tropical fringing coral reef.
   Live specimens of seven species of larger benthic foraminifers were
   collected from a nearby reef location, placed in small mesh bags, and
   deployed for five days at six different sites along a gradient of
   temperature (60-29 degrees C) and pH (5.9-8.1). Foraminiferal species
   that differ in shell structure (porcelaneous vs. hyaline) and
   composition (high- and intermediate-Mg calcite) were used in the
   experiment. Approximately 25% of the specimens, representing four of the
   seven species, retained normal symbiont color and exhibited minimal
   dissolution when exposed for five days to temperatures up to 60 degrees
   C and pH as low as 6.2; shells of specimens that lost symbiont color
   during deployment exhibited extensive corrosion. More than 80% of the
   specimens, representing at least one of each species, retained normal
   symbiont color where the temperature was approximately 40 degrees C and
   pH fluctuated between 5.9 and 7.4. These observations indicate that
   shells of reef-dwelling foraminifers can substantially resist
   dissolution, as long as organic matter is largely intact, under pH
   conditions sufficiently extreme to erase any fossil footprint.

AB In Melanesian pidgin languages, wantok means someone with a similar
   origin as oneself, and connotes a familiarity and mutual solidarity.
   Wantok has also become a watchword of politics and elite discourse on
   the Pacific Islands' political and social development, where it is a
   figure of corruption, clientelism, and the lingering influence of tribal
   identity. Even among grassroots people, wantok sociality is common,
   especially in urban places, but wantok talk tends to paint the wantok as
   a drain and burden. In this paper, I argue that when people perform
   wantok status they juxtapose village and town as inversions. They
   thereby create familiar relationships in uncertain situations, but also
   posit intimacy as inimical to the idea of modernity as embodied in
   towns. This suggests that the wantok idiom draws upon a particularly
   segmentary logic of relatedness in which solidarity is relative to
   difference of varying scales. In so doing, wantoks transform the nature
   of the kinship ties which inform them. As evidence, I examine debates
   over urbanisation in Papua New Guinea (PNG), and ethnographic
   observations of a rural-urban nexus of Normanby Island and Alotau in
   Milne Bay Province, PNG.

AB This paper offers an analytical framework for analyzing joint and
   separate decisions by couples in the context of choice experiments for
   nonmarket valuation. It reports results from an attribute-based stated
   preference study in which members of couples are asked to conduct a
   choice-experiment first individually and then jointly. The choice
   context was the selection of which beach to visit while on vacation in
   Tobago. Available alternatives differed in attributes related to coastal
   water and beach quality such as level of coastal development and fish
   abundance. Tests of preference equality are reported and structured so
   as to identify the intra-couple decision-making patterns under taste
   heterogeneity with both finite and continuous mixed logit. Results from
   the latter suggest that women's preferences are found to be predominant
   in the joint choice-experiment. Results suggest caution in using
   individual choice rather than joint couple choice when valuing quality
   changes impacting on couple activities, such as water and beach quality
   in Tobago, and call for further research on the topic.

AB Numerous food consumption studies have been carried out to assess the

   purpose not only of improving their nutritional status but also of
   revealing their mechanisms of adapting to the local environment.
   However, most of the research methods applied were problematic in
   reliability and accuracy. This paper aims to identify appropriate ways
   of methodologically assessing the previous food and nutrition studies,
   including my own, based on the following points: (1) unit of data
   collection, (2) sampling of subjects, (3) time duration and timing of
   data collection, (4) measurement of consumed amounts of foods, (5)
   conversion from foods consumed to nutrients absorbed, and (6)
   standardization to per-person (adult male) nutrient intake.

AB As part of a feasibility study of the commercialization potential of C.
   indicum nuts as Agroforestry Tree Products in Papua New Guinea,
   preliminary characterization studies have examined the tree-to-tree
   variation in morphological traits (nut and kernel mass and kernel:nut
   ratio), as well as nutritional (carbohydrate, fat, protein, sodium,
   vitamin E) and medicinal traits (anti-oxidant activity,
   anti-inflammatory activity and phenolic content) of kernels from 18 to
   72 trees in a small number of different villages of Papua New Guinea
   (East New Britain Province). There was continuous variation in these
   traits indicating opportunities for multiple trait cultivar development
   targeted at food and pharmaceutical markets. Certain traits, for example
   anti-inflammatory activity, in which tree-to-tree variation was highly
   significant, present greater opportunities than others, such as
   saturated:unsaturated fatty acid ratio. This intraspecific variation was
   greater within populations than between populations. The data presented
   has allowed the development of a strategy to domesticate C. indicum for
   cultivation in homegardens and cocoa-coconut agroforests, using a
   participatory approach aimed at the production of agroforestry tree
   products (AFTPs) to empower small-holders and enhance their livelihoods
   and income.

AB Papua New Guinea is one of the most valuable tropical regions but
   ecological research of its freshwater invertebrates has been lacking.
   The goal of this paper is to evaluate the species richness, diversity
   and structure of aquatic insect assemblages in different habitats in the
   Wanang River catchment in a well-preserved lowland rainforest.
   Assemblage structure was studied on two spatial scales - in different
   habitats (river, streams and stagnant pools) and in three mesohabitats
   in the river (slow and fast sections and submerged wood). The results
   show that headwater streams had the highest morphospecies diversity,
   while the river had the highest insect abundance. Slow and fast sections
   of the river differed both in terms of insect abundance and diversity.
   Furthermore, a number of unique wood-associated species was found on
   submerged wood. The most notable feature of the assemblage structure was
   scarcity of shredders and dominance of predators. However, predatory
   beetles, bugs and dragonfly larvae exhibited contrasting habitat
   preferences. This study shows that Papua New Guinean lowland rainforests
   host diverse and distinctly structured freshwater insect assemblages.

AB Ipomoea microdactyla Griseb. (Convolvulaceae) is restricted to the
   Bahamian archipelago, Cuba, and southeastern Florida. The species is
   listed as a state endangered species in Florida, where it is mostly
   restricted to the hyperfragmented pine rockland of Miami-Dade County.
   Using seven DNA microsatellite loci, we assessed levels of genetic
   diversity for 12 populations of this species from Andros Island in the
   Bahamas (six sites), Cuba (one site), and Florida (five sites). We found
   significantly greater mean numbers of alleles, and higher mean values
   for both observed and expected heterozygosity in populations from the
   continuous forest on Andros than those from the habitat fragments in
   Florida. It is unknown if these patterns of genetic diversity in the
   Florida populations are the result of habitat fragmentation or founder
   effects. The population from Cuba exhibited relatively high levels of
   genetic variation, suggesting that this island is a major center of
   diversity and dispersal for this species. It appears that hybrid
   introgression for I.carolina alleles within I.microdactyla individuals
   occurred at a single site on Andros Island. Overall, the mean inbreeding
   coefficient value was 0.089, suggesting low levels of inbreeding. The
   highest inbreeding coefficient values were mostly recorded in Florida.
   Two groups were revealed, one containing the populations from Florida,
   and the second one encompassing those from the Bahamas and Cuba. Our
   results highlight the negative genetic consequences of habitat
   fragmentation and support initiatives recently established to establish
   corridors to connect the remnants of the pine forest of the Miami-Dade
   County.

AB The Solomon Islands have one of the highest diversities of coral and

   species that are nnew to science. These discoveries were made during r a
   five-week scientific expedition to survey the marine life of the Solomon
   Islands, led by The Nature Conservancy and involving local and
   international non- LSgovernment organisations and Australian scientific
   e organisations. The survey of the Solomon Islands was a Rapid
   Ecological Assessment to document the biodiversity and status of marine
   ecosystems in the Solomon Islands as quickly as possible. Results have
   confirmed the effectiveness of conservation areas, particularly that of
   the Arnavon Islands which was established almost 10 years ago, showing
   that they can protect commercially important species and can help them
   to recover from overfishing. Outside conservation areas however,
   overfishing is widespread and there are many challenges to maintain the
   unique biodiversity.

AB Aim Vireya rhododendrons are distinctive and easily recognizable by
   their general form; however, they are virtually circumscribed
   geographically, predominantly distributed throughout the
   biogeographically intriguing Malesian Archipelago. Hypotheses of the
   evolutionary relationships of the group have been proposed but the
   biogeography of vireyas has not been analysed based on molecular
   phylogeny. Recently, the first detailed molecular phylogenetic
   investigation of section Vireya was completed based on cp- and nrDNA
   sequence data, therefore making this cladistic biogeographic study of
   vireya rhododendrons possible.
   Location Malesia, Australia, Solomon Islands, Taiwan, Himalayas, north
   Vietnam and south China.
   Methods Based on distribution maps, areas of endemism were determined
   for the biogeographic region of Malesia. Area relationships were
   analysed based on a recent molecular phylogeny of species in section
   Vireya. The method of paralogy-free subtree analysis was applied.
   Results Individual distribution maps were produced for 74 species of
   Rhododendron section Vireya. Species clades with bootstrap support
   proved to be biogeographically informative. Major clades correspond to
   three regions: eastern Malesia, western/middle Malesia and Taiwan/north
   Vietnam/south China. Within eastern Malesia, Australia, New Guinea, the
   Bismarck Archipelago and Solomon Islands are related. In western
   Malesia, northern Philippines, Borneo, southern Moluccas and north and
   west Sulawesi are related. These areas are more distantly related to
   Sumatra, the Malay peninsula, Java, Bali, Palawan, Lesser Sunda islands
   and the southern Philippines. The position of the Himalayas is equivocal
   and part of a basal polytomy in the summary area cladogram.
   Main conclusions Two alternative hypotheses are proposed for the
   evolution of vireya rhododendrons based on the pattern of area
   relationships. The first hypothesis is that the vireyas are an old
   group, with ancestors present on Gondwana, rifting north in the
   Cretaceous. The second alternative hypothesis is that vireyas are a
   young group that has dispersed eastwards from India to Australia and the
   Solomon Islands since the current Malesian islands formed.

AB Invasive species generate significant environmental and economic costs,
   with maintenance management constituting a major expenditure. Such costs
   are generated by invasive Indo-Pacific lionfish (Pterois spp.) that
   further threaten already stressed coral reefs in the western Atlantic
   Ocean and Caribbean Sea. This brief review documents rapid range
   expansion and potential impacts of lionfish. In addition, preliminary
   experimental data from targeted removals contribute to debates about
   maintenance management. Removals at sites off Little Cayman Island
   shifted the size frequency distribution of remaining lionfish toward
   smaller individuals whose stomachs contained less prey and fewer fish.
   Fewer lionfish and decreased predation on threatened grouper, herbivores
   and other economically and ecologically important fishes represent key
   steps toward protecting reefs. However, complete evaluation of success
   requires long-term data detailing immigration and recruitment by
   lionfish, compensatory growth and reproduction of lionfish, reduced
   direct effects on prey assemblages, and reduced indirect effects
   mediated by competition for food. Preventing introductions is the best
   way to avoid impacts from invasive species, and early detection linked
   to rapid response ranks second. Nevertheless, results from this case
   study suggest that targeted removals represent a viable option for
   shifting direct impacts of invasive lionfish away from highly vulnerable
   components of ecosystems.

AB Drawing attention to interactions between processes affecting
   biodiversity loss in marine environments and effects on food security,
   we draw on research in the Turks and Caicos Islands (TCI), a UK Overseas
   Territory in the Caribbean. Seagrass meadows provide ecosystem
   supporting services critical for human wellbeing. They are declining
   globally due to coastal development, poor land management, and
   destructive fishing practices. These systems are linked to traditional
   ways of life with multiple intangible values representing an important
   cultural resource for coastal communities. Using the lens of food
   security, we undertake interdisciplinary social-ecological research, to
   better understand the governance of ecosystem services and the food
   system in TCI. Research draws on mixed qualitative methods and data
   gathered via SeagrassWatch, fish surveys and meta-analysis of fish
   assemblages, revealing anthropogenic stressors exposing TCI to economic
   and environmental shocks characteristic of small island Caribbean
   states. We find growing concern regarding the islands' high dependence
   on food imports, coupled with declining availability of local fish and
   seafood across socio-economic groups. Weak governance structures put
   TCI's marine resources under increasing threat, with consequences for
   food security. We argue for the application of the precautionary
   principle, suggesting conservation actions through societal
   participation and stakeholder engagement. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All

   varied duality of the dog's role in the Saladoid world: from food source
   to lifelong companion. The importance of dogs within Amerindian sites
   from Saint Martin, the Guadeloupe archipelago, Martinique and Barbuda
   will be explored from a zooarchaeological perspective, concluding with a
   critical discussion of changes in cultural patterns, as seen through the

AB Low-lying, small reef islands on Pacific atolls are vulnerable to
   coastal erosion and flooding, mainly due to rises in sea level, as well
   as local stresses associated with overpopulation. Because reef island
   sediments on Pacific atolls are composed mostly of shells of large
   benthic foraminifers (LBFs), their future stability depends on
   understanding foraminiferal shell sources and their production rates
   around the islands. Here, we report on the distribution and population
   density of LBFs around Fongafale Island, the main populated island of
   Tuvalu in the South Pacific, where coastal erosion and inundation have
   occurred. We discuss their controlling factors, in particular,
   anthropogenic influences on foraminiferal distribution. The results
   based on multivariate analyses (canonical correlation analysis and
   multiple regression analysis) demonstrated that Baculogypsina
   sphaerulata and Amphistegina lobifera were more common on the
   high-energy, intertidal ocean reef flats (<= 10(6) and <= 10(4)
   individuals m(-2), respectively), and B. sphaerulata was less common
   around the populated area of the island. On the relatively low-energy
   subtidal lagoon reef flats, Amphistegina lessonii was the most common
   species, particularly in the dry (leeward) season, with an increasing
   density in deeper offshore zones (<= 10(4) individuals m(-2)). Sorites
   orbiculus was less common than the other species, but was found on both
   sides of the reef flats (<= 10(3) individuals m(-2)). Macroalgal delta
   N-15 values indicated that upwelling nutrient-rich deep water could be
   the source of nitrogen for oceanic waters, whereas nutrients in lagoon
   seawater could be partly derived from groundwater mixing with domestic
   wastewater, especially near the populated area. These results suggest
   that the distribution and population density of LBFs in the study area
   are influenced by spatial differences in water energy and water quality,
   and that B. sphaerulata is less tolerant of nutrient loading than other
   species. Comparison of distributions between living individuals and
   empty shells indicated that ocean reef flats are the primary source of
   foraminiferal shells for reef islands and lagoon beaches. (C) 2014

   this seagrass in Dominica and St. Lucia, demonstrating it has spread
   across part of the eastern Caribbean. H. stipulacea in Dominica was
   present in seven locations along the west coast covering more than 22.9
   ha of the benthos, at depths from 2 to 18 m. Populations were
   concentrated in or adjacent to bays frequented by recreational or
   commercial boats, likely vectors for the introduction. Morphological
   features varied from bed to bed, with depth being the predominant
   driving factor. H. stipulacea had a rapid mean lateral bed expansion
   rate of 0.5 cm d(-1), with a maximum rate of >6 cm d(-1). H. stipulacea
   patches often occurred exclusive of the otherwise dominant seagrasses of
   the Caribbean. The potential for the expansion of H. stipulacea,
   combined with its tolerance for a wide spectrum of environmental
   conditions, positions it as a potential threat to local and regional

AB We report on the first comprehensive DNA barcoding survey of bats from
   Jamaica and compare the genetic variation to similar species on South
   America and Central America. Bats comprise the majority of mammalian
   diversity in typical lowland forest in the Neotropics, but the Caribbean
   is one noticeable geographic gap in the International Barcode of Life
   reference database. Of the 20 known species reported from Jamaica, half
   were DNA barcoded and were genetically distinct with interspecific
   variation ranging from 17 to 33%. By contrast, intraspecific variation
   ranged from 0 to 0.5% indicating that the barcode gap was sufficient in
   differentiating bat species diversity in Jamaica. The low levels of
   intraspecific divergence indicate that the populations within each
   species are relatively homogeneous across the island. There were,
   however, several cases of high sequence divergence for widely
   distributed species that occur on both the Caribbean islands and the
   continental mainland, which warrant further taxonomic study.

AB Paryphantopsis bradleyi new species is described from a sub-montane
   forest near Crater Mountain Biological Research Station in Simbu
   Province, central Papua New Guinea. It is distinguished from its
   congeners by the combination of its large size and sharply pointed,
   non-overlapping periostracal processes that are retained to maturity. It
   shares similarities and is probably closely related to other large
   Paryphantopsis Thiele, 1928, that have angled to carinate shell margins
   with long periostracal processes and central and lateral radular teeth
   that have mesocones originating from the center of their basal plates.
   It appears that imich of New Guinea's highly endemic terrestrial snail
   fauna remains to be discovered. It is imperative that the biodiversity
   of large groups of taxa is documented because this information will be
   crucial in efforts to preserve rapidly diminishing rainforest habitat.

AB The ferromanganese crusts in the central Pacific seamounts have been
   believed as most abundant and enriched in cobalt according to the
   earlier studies by the USGS, KORDI, MMAJ and GSJ since 1980's.
   Small-scale areal variations of the deposits and their relationship to
   topography and geology have not yet been well documented, since their
   discussion have been based mainly on dredge samples with inaccurate
   sampling positions over rough topographic maps. We investigated the
   ferromanganese crust areas using a TV camera-monitored drill machine
   (BMS) after full multi-narrow beam mapping over three flat-top seamounts
   in the Marshall Islands area. The cruise data revealed characteristics
   of small-scale variation in relation to water depth, substrate geology,
   and often topography.
   The mapping and BMS sampling have shown that the thickness (up to 120
   mm) and growth patterns of the crusts are basically related to substrate
   geology and topography, which in turn indicates possibility of geology
   and topography is significant parameters in estimating development and
   continuity of the sea-bed crusts over seamounts.
   On the other hand, fine-scale (in millimeter) compositional and
   structural variations were also described for several nice drill cores,
   which is another important factor in estimating ore reserves. Our
   preliminary data of depth- compositional profiles demonstrated
   significant enrichment of cobalt in younger layers a crust, as high as
   those of regional variations. More importantly, some of the chemical
   profiles are correspondent to each other even between the studied
   seamounts far apart over the western Pacific.

AB Spatial isolation and geological history are important factors in the
   diversification and population differentiation of species. Here we
   describe distributional patterns of ants in the genus Acropyga across
   Papua New Guinea (PNG), a highly biodiverse but little-studied region.
   We estimate phylogenetic relationships among currently recognised
   species of Acropyga and assess population genetic structure of the
   widespread species, A. acutiventris, across lowland areas of the island.
   We find that species of Acropyga present in PNG diversified during the
   Pliocene, between six and two million years ago. Most species now
   exhibit a patchy distribution that does not show a strong signal of
   geological history. However, the population genetic structure of the
   widespread species A. acutiventris has been influenced by geography,
   habitat association and, possibly, historical habitat fragmentation.
   There is a significant effect of isolation-by-distance within continuous
   lowland forest, and proximity to Australia has had a larger impact in
   structuring populations of A. acutiventris in PNG than has the Central
   Papuan Cordillera. This study is the first to describe population
   genetic patterns of an ant species in Papua New Guinea.

AB Three species of bats, Pteropus pilosus, P. mariannus pelewensis, and
   Emballonura semicaudata palauensis, were surveyed by observations,
   systematic counts, and interviews with local residents in the Palau
   Islands of Micronesia during a one-month period in 1991. Pteropus
   pilosus is presumed extinct, with no observations made this century.
   Pteropus m. pelewensis occurred throughout the archipelago. It is less
   colonial than other subspecies of P. mariannus, with most of the
   population appearing to roost solitarily or in small groups of a few
   bats. Colonies were uncommon and typically ranged in size from about
   30-200 animals. Evidence of two larger roosting concentrations, one of
   which may have held as many as 3,000 bats, was also found. These fruit
   bats forage and roost in a variety of forested habitats and have diverse
   diets known to contain the fruits of 53 species, the flowers of 28
   species, and the leaves of one species. At dusk, most bats began
   foraging within several kilometres of their day roosts, but some flew at
   least 12 kin to reach feeding sites. The largest numbers of P. in.
   pelewensis roosted on rugged and fairly inaccessible limestone islands
   near the centre of the archipelago, near where most people also lived.
   We were unable to estimate population size or determine population trend
   in the island chain. The bats are heavily harvested for commercial
   export, with more than 180,000 animals shipped to the Mariana Islands
   from 1975-1994. Smaller numbers are also killed as a local food source.
   Emballonura s. palauensis, the only insectivorous bat in the islands,
   was seen at 65% of the evening count locations and was also widespread
   in the archipelago. Recommendations for managing bats in Palau include a
   prohibition on the export of fruit bats and the establishment of several
   protected areas.

AB Diseases related to poor water, sanitation and hygiene (WaSH) are major
   causes of mortality and morbidity. While pursuing marketing approaches
   to WaSH to improve health outcomes is often narrowly associated with
   monetary exchange, marketing theory recognises four broad marketing
   exchange archetypes: market-based, non-market-based, command-based and
   culturally determined. This diversity reflects the need for parameters
   broader than monetary exchange when improving WaSH. This study applied a
   participatory action research process to investigate how impoverished
   communities in Melanesian urban and peri-urban informal settlements
   attempt to meet their WaSH needs through marketing exchange. Exchanges
   of all four archetypes were present, often in combination. Motivations
   for participating in the marketing exchanges were based on social
   relationships alongside WaSH needs, health aspirations and financial
   circumstances. By leveraging these motivations and pre-existing, self
   determined marketing exchanges, WaSH practitioners may be able to foster
   WaSH marketing exchanges consistent with local context and capabilities,
   in turn improving community physical, mental and social health. (C) 2016

AB Siphonophores are one of the least known gelatinous zooplankters in the
   tropical waters of the Northwestern Atlantic. Most of the regional
   knowledge about their diversity and distribution is based on surface
   samples (0-200 m). Siphonophores were collected from oceanic waters off
   the Mexican Caribbean across an expanded sampling range (0-940 m) during
   two cruises and were taxonomically examined. A total of 47 siphonophore
   species were recorded, of these, 14 had not been found in this sector of
   the Caribbean Sea and 10 represent new records for the Caribbean Basin.
   The number of species currently known from the western Caribbean is
   increased from 42 to 56. Some of these species also represent new
   records for the Northwestern Tropical Atlantic region. The greatest
   relative increase was observed among species of Lensia, five of which
   are exclusively deep-living forms dwelling below 300 m. A revised,
   expanded checklist of the siphonophores of the Western Caribbean is also
   provided. These results confirm the need of further deep sampling to
   increase our understanding of Caribbean siphonophore diversity.

   importantly, eliminating the production of domestic pigs. These changes
   were undertaken as part of an effort to improve the life experience of
   local residents and usher in a new plan of village improvement. The plan
   promoted the disintensification of subsistence production and increased
   involvement in cash-earning and recreational pursuits, as well as
   Christianity. If successful, the promoters of the plan hope that the
   village will become a more attractive place to live, migrants living

AB Fish populations utilised by riparian populations along the Fly River,
   Papua New Guinea (PNG), downstream of the Ok Tedi gold and copper mine
   have markedly declined in species richness (between 21 and 90%) and
   biomass (between 57 and 87%) during the operation of the mine (Storey et
   al., The Fly River Papua New Guinea. Environmental studies in an
   impacted tropical river system. Developments in Earth and Environmental
   Sciences, vol 9. Elsevier, Amsterdam, pp 427-462, 2009). A concern was
   that copper in wastes from the mine were negatively impacting algae in
   the river, thus altering the food web supporting the fish populations.
   This investigation found that the mining discharge to the Fly River
   increased, rather than decreased algal biomass in the Fly River, and did
   not appear to impact algae in associated off-river water bodies. It
   appears that nitrogenous explosives used in the mine have a fertilizing
   impact on the Fly River. There was no apparent impact of mine discharges
   on phytoplankton in the floodplain off-river water bodies, which was
   often concentrated in a prominent sub-surface maximum, and was not the
   main source of riverine plankton.

AB This study examines the variation in tropical cyclone (TC) intensity for
   different phases of the El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) phenomenon
   in the Fiji, Samoa, and Tonga (FST) region. The variation in TC
   intensity is inferred from the accumulated cyclone energy (ACE), which
   is constructed from the 6-hourly Joint Typhoon Warning Center best-track
   data for the period 1985-2006. Overall, results suggest that ACE in the
   FST region is considerably influenced by the ENSO signal. A substantial
   contribution to this ENSO signal in ACE comes from the region
   equatorward of 15 degrees S where TC numbers, lifetime, and intensity
   all play a significant role. However, the ACE-ENSO relationship weakens
   substantially poleward of 15 degrees S where large-scale environmental
   variables affecting TC intensity are found to be less favorable during
   El Nino years than during La Nina years; in the region equatorward of 15
   degrees S, the reverse is true. Therefore, TCs entering this region
   poleward of 15 degrees S are able to sustain their intensity for a
   longer period of time during La Nina years as opposed to TCs entering
   the region during El Nino years, when they decay more rapidly.

   tropical insular mangroves for this region and its aim was to assess
   habitat usage by fish species. Two mangroves of Sao Tome Island (Praia
   das Conchas and Malanza) were sampled with a multihabitat approach and
   using different fishing gear to maximise the diversity of fish species
   collected. Several environmental parameters were also measured. Both
   mangroves are nursery and opportunistic feeding grounds for fish
   species, as well as settlement areas for resident species. The highest
   number of both juveniles and adults (inshore and residents) was observed
   at the Malanza mangrove, which is also the largest and has the highest
   habitat heterogeneity. Four new occurrences were reported for the Sao
   Tome and Principe area, namely Pomadasys jubelini, Bostrychus africanus,
   Dalophis cephalopeltis and the introduced species Oreochromis

AB From June, 2007, to February, 2009, the Waria Valley Community
   Conservation and Sustainable Livelihoods Project (WVCP) completed an
   inventory survey of the birds of the lower Waria Valley, Morobe
   Province, Papua New Guinea. Four land use types - agricultural,
   secondary forest edge, primary forest edge and primary forest - were
   surveyed using Mackinnon list surveys. In total, 125 species
   representing 43 families were identified, of which 54 (43.2%) are
   endemic to the islands of New Guinea and the Bismark Archipelago. The
   avifauna of primary forest edge and primary forest was more species rich
   and diverse than that of agricultural habitats. Agricultural habitats
   also differed significantly in both overall community composition and
   some aspects of guild composition compared to all three forested
   habitats. Nectarivores and insectivore-frugivores formed a significantly
   larger proportion of species in agricultural habitats, whereas obligate
   frugivores formed a significantly greater proportion in forested
   habitats. We propose further survey and management initiatives that
   could help contribute to the conservation and sustainable use of the
   area's important biological resources.

   gekkonid lizard, and four snakes) were recorded on Pohnpei and adjacent
   Ant Atoll (Federated States of Micronesia) for the first time within the
   past 15 yr, three within the past 3 yr. They apparently reached Pohnpei
   by deliberate or inadvertent human-assisted transport, originating from
   widespread and distant areas including North America, Southeast Asia,
   Indoaustralia, and other Pacific islands. Pohnpeians (and many other
   Pacific islanders) often do not perceive exotics as a potential threat
   to the balance of natural ecosystems. Additional training and education
   addressing the potentially disastrous consequences of alien species and
   directed especially toward agencies entrusted with monitoring
   environmental quality are recommended to help preserve biodiversity on
   these small island nations.

AB This study attempts to gain much needed information on the food shopping

   collected through the use of a questionnaire.  The questionnaire was
   mailed to respondents randomly selected from three geographical areas in
   Trinidad, each thought to be representative of a distinct income group.
   The findings from the study seem to indicate that regardless of income
   status, the Trinidadian consumer is a very careful shopper.  It was
   found that most shoppers made a list prior to going to the grocery, and
   tend to buy most of the items on the list.  There is little impulse
   buying but a high degree of coupon redemption.  Much emphasis was also
   placed by shoppers on the information on labels as being an important
   criterion when deciding which brand(s) to purchase.  Shoppers display
   limited brand loyalty, are highly price conscious and consider
   experimental sources of information as the most important in deciding on
   their purchases.

AB We compared, through allozyme and cytochrome b sequence analyses,
   populations of Bathygobius soporator from four localities on the
   Brazilian coast with those from the Oceanic Islands of the Rocas Atoll
   (230 km off the Brazilian coast) and the Bahamas (5700 km northwest from
   Rocas). The population from the Rocas Atoll was genetically more similar
   to the geographically distant Bahamas (gene identity, I=0.92) than to
   the supposedly conspecific populations from the Brazilian coast (I <
   0.55). Five diagnostic allozyme loci and a high level of nucleotide
   divergence (Kimura 2-parameters=0.21) were found between the two groups,
   further confirming that they must belong to different biological
   species. Since the type locality of B. soporator is in the Caribbean,
   the binomial should be maintained for the Bahamas/Rocas Atoll
   populations, and the other Brazilian populations of Bathygobius analysed
   either represent the occurrence of a species of Bathygobius hitherto not
   cited for the Brazilian coast, or belong to a new species. The coastal
   populations of this species were also found to be highly structured
   (F-ST=0.18; p < 0.05), indicating that, even along the coast, levels of
   gene flow of this species are limited. This could be related to their
   reproductive biology (adhesive benthic eggs with parental care and short
   length of larval life). The timings of the divergence between the
   Caribbean and the Southwest Atlantic, species found here, estimated from
   allozymes and cytb sequences, are very similar (around 10 MY bp), and
   correlate with the start of the Amazon river outflow. The colonization
   of the Rocas Atoll by populations from the Caribbean seems to have taken
   place after the Caribbean and the Brazilian coast species had diverged.

AB Marine geophysical data including Seabeam, seismic reflection,
   magnetics, gravimetry and side-scan sonar have been recently collected
   along the northern Caribbean strike-slip plate boundary between Cuba and
   Hispaniola, in the Windward Passage area, The analysis of this
   comprehensive data set allows us to illustrate active strike-slip
   tectonic processes in relation to the kinematics of the Caribbean Plate.
   We show that the transcurrent plate boundary trace runs straight across
   the Windward Passage, from the southern Cuban Margin in the west
   (Oriente Fault) to the Tortue Channel in the east. The Windward Passage
   Deep is thus not an active pull-apart basin, as previously suggested.
   The plate boundary geometry implies that the motion of the Caribbean
   Plate relative to the North American Plate is partitioned between a
   strike-slip component, accommodated by the Windward Passage active fault
   zone, and a convergence component, accommodated by compression at the
   bottom of the Northern Hispaniola Margin. On the basis of a correlation
   with onland geological data, an age is given to the stratigraphic
   sequences identified on seismic profiles. A kinematic reconstruction is
   proposed that follows the tectonic unconformities recognized at sea and
   on land (Late Eocene, Early Miofene, Middle Miocene and Late Pliocene).
   Each one of these tectonic events corresponds to a drastic
   reorganization of the plate boundary geometry. We propose to correlate
   these events with successive collisions of the northern Caribbean mobile
   terranes against the Bahamas Bank. During each event, the plate boundary
   trace is shifted to the south and a part of the Caribbean Plate is
   accreted to North America.

   in Pacific, Caribbean and Atlantic waters, with most being strongly
   influenced by continental runoff containing large amounts of sediments
   and high concentrations of nutrients flowing out of some of the largest
   rivers in the world; the Amazon, Orinoco and Magdalena rivers.
   Cold-water upwellings along the Pacific coasts of Panama and Colombia,
   and off eastern Venezuela also reduce reef growth. The reefs in Brazil
   are far removed from those in the Caribbean and hence contain a high
   proportion of endemic species. The coral reefs are less developed with
   fewer coral species on the Pacific side, with the best reefs on the
   Costa Rica-Panama coast.

AB This article focuses on agricultural land-use changes in Cuba following
   the fall of the Soviet Union. In response to the end of Soviet
   subsidies, which previously underwrote Cuba's industrial agricultural
   system, the government rapidly transitioned from large, centralized
   agricultural operations to small-scale farming and cooperatives to
   address local food security. This paper uses a variety of empirical data
   sources, including remote sensing data available from the Wildlife
   Conservation Society (WCS) and the Food and Agriculture Organization
   (FAO), to unpack some of the land-use implications of this radical
   agrarian transition. Combined, these data shed new light on the
   magnitude and nature of agrarian landuse changes that have occurred over
   the past several decades in Cuba. The paper concludes by placing these
   empirics in the context of shifting geopolitics and the increasing
   impacts of climate change, issues of great concern to Cuba and other
   island nations in the Caribbean.

AB To aid in the designation of a marine protected area for hawksbill sea
   turtles, Eretmochelys imbricata (Linnaeus, 1766), nesting at one of the
   largest rookeries in the Wider Caribbean Region (Needham's Point,
   Barbados), we elucidated key inter-nesting behaviors (i.e., the
   approximately 2-wk period of time spent at sea between nesting events)
   from published spatial, diving, and habitat utilization data, and the
   areas of overlap and potential conflict with anthropogenic uses of the
   coastal zone. Historically, much of the focus of conservation efforts
   for this species has been on protecting breeding females and their eggs
   from harvest, and more recently protection of nesting beaches. However,
   protecting the habitats in which these animals spend their inter-nesting
   interval and addressing the indirect anthropogenic mortality they are
   exposed to while in these nearshore habitats has received less
   attention. Despite a relatively small percentage of a hawksbill's
   life-cycle being spent in inter-nesting habitats, the relative value of
   adult females for population recovery and the vulnerability associated
   with large aggregations of females adjacent to rookeries makes this
   mature stage of their life-cycle one of high conservation priority.

AB Savo, Solomon Islands, is a historically active volcano dominated by
   sodic, alkaline lavas, and pyroclastic rocks with up to 7.5 wt% Na2O,
   and high Sr, arc-like trace element chemistry. The suite is dominated by
   mugearites (plagioclase-clinopyroxene-magnetite +/- A amphibole +/- A
   olivine) and trachytes (plagioclase-amphibole-magnetite +/- A biotite).
   The presence of hydrous minerals (amphibole, biotite) indicates
   relatively wet magmas. In such melts, plagioclase is relatively unstable
   relative to iron oxides and ferromagnesian silicates; it is the latter
   minerals (particularly hornblende) that dominate cumulate nodules at
   Savo and drive the chemical differentiation of the suite, with a limited
   role for plagioclase. This is potentially occurring in a crustal "hot
   zone", with major chemical differentiation occurring at depth. Batches
   of magma ascend periodically, where they are subject to decompression,
   water saturation and further cooling, resulting in closed-system
   crystallisation of plagioclase, and ultimately the production of sodic,
   crystal and feldspar-rich, high-Sr rocks. The sodic and hydrous nature
   of the parental magmas is interpreted to be the result of partial
   melting of metasomatised mantle, but radiogenic isotope data (Pb, Sr,
   Nd) cannot uniquely identify the source of the metasomatic agent.

   shell assemblages in lagoonal areas reflect these geomorphological
   differences. On each atoll, 32 to 44 recent sediment samples were taken
   (total number of samples 111) and bivalve shells subsequently
   identified. The resulting database (32,122 bivalve shells in total) was
   analysed using Q-mode cluster analyses. Both the distribution of species
   characteristic of different lagoonal habitats and the distribution of
   bivalves with different life and feeding habits were investigated.
   Epifaunal suspension feeders were found particularly on hard-bottom
   along the reef-crests or clinging to mangrove roots. Infaunal suspension
   feeders show a more diverse distribution. Deeper lagoonal parts and
   areas with mangrove growth are often inhabited by chemosymbiont-carrying
   bivalves, indicating locations of reduced sediment. Deep burrowing
   detritus feeders are very abundant in shallow-water areas with moderate

AB Small Island Developing States (SIDS) import increasing amounts of
   fossil fuel to meet their rising energy demand. This places an
   unnecessary financial burden on their budget, as abundant Renewable
   Energy Sources (RES) are often available. The introduction of Renewable
   Energy Technologies (RETs) can harness these resources, providing
   sufficient electricity as well as maintaining a high degree of
   independence. However, one of the principle barriers to their
   application has been the high cost of installing them. This paper argues
   that the economics of instigating RETs on SIDS are potentially
   favourable over the application of fossil fuel technologies if the full
   life-cycle costs are considered. A case study conducted in 2001,
   modelling three alternative electricity provision scenarios on
   Rodrigues, Mauritius supports these assumptions. The findings are based
   on a comparative economic model using Discounted Cash Flow (DCF)
   analyses, as well as a variety of sensitivity analyses, to predict
   changing economic environments. This provides crucial guidance for the
   formulation of energy policy and planning. This work is part of a
   tripartite research project that connects the economics with renewable
   resources assessment and a multi criteria analysis investigating the
   social and environmental consequences to provide a transferable
   framework assessment of renewable energy supply options on SIDS. (C)

AB This article seeks further evidence on the elasticity of calorie demand
   with respect to household resources. The case presented is for urban
   areas of Papua New Guinea, where just over one-half of the population
   appear to obtain less than the recommended amount of dietary energy. The
   relationship between per capita calorie consumption and per capita
   expenditure in urban areas of Papua 'New Guinea is not consistent with
   the view that income changes have negligible effects on nutrient
   intakes. The unconditional calorie demand elasticity is approximately
   0.6 for the poorest half of the population. Using parametric and
   semiparametric estimation to control for a wide range of other
   influences on calorie consumption does not materially reduce the size of
   the elasticity. Therefore, these results are not supportive of
   'growth-pessimism' and instead suggest that policies that increase urban
   household incomes will also act to reduce undernutrition.

AB Two new species of dorid nudibranchs of the genus Tambja arc described
   from the Indo-Pacific and the temperate waters of the western Atlantic.
   Tambja haidari sp. nov. is only known from the type locality in Senegal.
   This species has dark blue ground colour with yellow bands and sky-blue
   spots, which become real tubercles along the tail. The internal features
   are typical of species of the genus, with rachidian teeth that lack
   denticles and with a prostate slightly differentiated from the rest of
   the vas deferens. Tambja blacki sp. nov., from Papua New Guinea and
   eastern Australia, has yellow-green or green colour with black blotches.
   There are two large blotches oil the head continuing from the inner side
   of the base of the rhinophores towards the rear. The notal margin is
   elevated and joins behind the gill in a well-developed hump. The
   reproductive system of this species is very characteristic because it
   has some features more typical of species of Nembrotha than of Tambja
   (i.e. vaginal gland absent, prostate spread over the bursa copulatrix
   and wide and elongate vagina). These descriptions bring the number of
   species of Tambja found around the world to 31.

AB Small Island Developing States (SIDS) are island nations that experience
   specific social, economic and environmental vulnerabilities associated
   with small populations, isolation and limited resources. Globally, SIDS
   exhibit exceptionally high rates of non-communicable disease (NCD) risk
   and incidence. Despite this, there is a lack of context-specific
   research within SIDS focused on life course approaches to NCD
   prevention, particularly the impact of the early-life environment on
   later disease risk as defined by the Developmental Origins of Health and
   Disease (DOHaD) framework. Given that globalization has contributed to
   significant nutritional transitions in these populations, the DOHaD
   paradigm is highly relevant. SIDS in the Pacific region have the highest
   rates of NCD risk and incidence globally. Transitions from traditional
   foods grown locally to reliance on importation of Western-style
   processed foods high in fat and sugar are common. The Cook Islands is
   one Pacific SIDS that reports this transition, alongside rising
   overweight/obesity rates, currently 91%/72%, in the adult population.
   However, research on early-life NCD prevention within this context, as
   in many low- and middle-income countries, is scarce. Although
   traditional research emphasizes the need for large sample sizes, this is
   rarely possible in the smaller SIDS. In these vulnerable, high priority
   countries, consideration should be given to utilizing small' sample
   sizes that encompass a high proportion of the total population. This may
   enable contextually relevant research, crucial to inform NCD prevention
   strategies that can contribute to improving health and well-being for
   these at-risk communities.

AB Lithification with related diagenetic phenomena is an important step in
   a complex transition from living communities to fossil assemblages and a
   major taphonomic filter distorting the record of past biodiversity.
   Apart from direct diagenetic culling of fossils, cementation of
   fossiliferous deposits induces changes in sampling procedures used to
   extract paleontological data. This study explores the effects of this
   methodological shift on recorded fine-scale paleoecological patterns by
   using subfossil mollusk assemblages occurring in the unlithified and
   recently cemented storm-beach carbonate sands at Sand Dollar Beach, San
   Salvador Island, Bahamas, which experienced limited diagenetic
   alteration. Results show that consistent differences in relative
   abundance patterns of particular taxa can be observed between
   unlithified and lithified samples due to collection failure. Magnitude
   of this distortion is controlled in a large part by a degree of
   transport-related size sorting, with well-sorted assemblages dominated
   by small gastropods being more affected. This bias, however, is of
   limited importance and can be mitigated by selective exclusion of the
   smallest size classes (<5 mm) from the analysis. Moreover, unlithified
   and poorly lithified deposits record very similar rarefied richness
   estimates and patterns of diversity partitioning. This contrasts
   strongly with earlier estimates of lithification-related diversity loss,
   suggesting greater importance of diagenetic over methodological filters
   in creating lithification bias observed in the older rock record. Poorly
   Milled carbonate rocks-present in many late Neogene successions-may
   yield biodiversity data directly comparable to those recorded by
   unlithified sediments if careful collecting methods based on bulk
   samples are employed.

   with other specimens of Chthamalus from the Indian Ocean, Indo-Malaya,
   northern Australia, Vietnam, China and the western Pacific, using
   'arthropodal' as well as shell characters.
   Chthamalus malayensis occurs widely in Indo-Malayan and tropical
   Australian waters. It ranges westwards in the Indian Ocean to East
   Africa and northwards in the Pacific to Vietnam, China and the Ryukyu
   Islands. Chthamalus malayensis has the arthropodal characters attributed
   to it by Pope (1965); conical spines on cirrus 1 and serrate setae with
   basal guards on cirrus 2.
   Chthamalus moro is currently fully validated only for the Philippines,
   Indonesia, Taiwan, the Xisha (Paracel) Islands, the Ryukyu Islands, the
   Mariana Islands, the Caroline Islands, Fiji and Samoa. It is a small
   species of the 'challengeri' subgroup, lacking conical spines on cirrus
   1 and bearing pectinate setae without basal guards on cirrus 2. It may
   be a 'relict' insular species.
   Chthamalus challengeri also lacks conical spines on cirrus 1 and has
   pectinate setae without basal guards on cirrus 2. Records of C.
   challengers south of japan are probably erroneous. However, there is an
   undescribed species of the 'challengeri' subgroup in the Indian Ocean,
   Indo-Malaya, Vietnam and southern China and yet more may occur in the
   western Pacific. The subgroups 'malayensis' and 'challengeri' require
   genetic investigation.
   Some comments are included on the arthropodal characters and
   geographical distributions of Chthamalus antennatus, C dalli and C.
   stellatus.

AB The Antillean manatee (Trichechus manatus manatus Linnaeus, 1758) is
   classified as endangered by the International Union for Conservation of
   Nature because of reduced numbers and habitat loss. Existing information
   about this species in Cuba is limited, but it can be synthesized into
   useful guidance for strategies to protect and rehabilitate this
   population. Anthropogenic threats have been reported to have had
   detrimental effects on manatees since 1970, with a major factor being
   illegal hunting. Information obtained through interviews of fishers, and
   boat and aerial surveys has identified the Ensenada de la Broa and
   Hatiguanico River on the Zapata Peninsula as important areas for
   manatees. Historically, manatees frequented rivers and other freshwater
   habitats, but currently they are encountered primarily in estuarine and
   coastal waters, which makes availability of fresh water an important
   consideration. There is a pressing need to gather additional and more
   reliable data on the abundance, distribution, and health of Antillean
   manatees in Cuba as a basis for more effective and efficient initiatives
   to protect and rehabilitate this population.

AB Historical records of ciguatera in Mexico date back to 1862. This
   review, including references and epidemiological reports, documents 464
   cases during 25 events from 1984 to 2013: 240 (51.72%) in Baja
   California Sur, 163 (35.12%) in Quintana Roo, 45 (9.69%) in Yucatan, and
   16 (3.44%) cases of Mexican tourists intoxicated in Cuba. Carnivorous
   fish, such as snapper (Lutjanus) and grouper (Epinephelus and
   Mycteroperca) in the Pacific Ocean, and great barracuda (Sphyraena
   barracuda) and snapper (Lutjanus) in the Atlantic (Gulf of Mexico and
   Caribbean Sea), were involved in all cases. In the Mexican Caribbean, a
   sub-record of ciguatera cases that occurred before 1984 exists. However,
   the number of intoxications has increased in recent years, and this food
   poisoning is poorly studied in the region. Current records suggest that
   ciguatera fish poisoning in humans is the second most prevalent form of
   seafood poisoning in Mexico, only exceeded by paralytic shellfish
   poisoning (505 cases, 21 fatalities in the same 34-year period). In this
   study, the status of ciguatera in Mexico (epidemiological and
   treatment), and the fish vectors are reviewed. Dinoflagellate species
   Gambierdiscus, Ostreopsis, and Prorocentrum are related with the
   reported outbreaks, marine toxins, ecological risk, and the potential
   toxicological impact.

AB Distribution of leptocephali of Conger in the Western North Atlantic
   Ocean was studied using specimens from our collections, specimens from
   other collections, and various existing collection records. The presence
   of leptocephali of Conger oceanicus and Conger triporiceps < 30 mm long
   over deep water in the southwestern Sargasso Sea in autumn and winter
   implies a protracted spawning period there. The subtropical convergence
   zone, meandering east-west across the Sargasso Sea, is probably the
   northern limit of spawning of both species. Spawning may also occur
   close to the Bahamas and Antilles. C triporiceps may spawn also in the
   Caribbean Sea judging by the capture of small leptocephali in the
   western Caribbean and of the more southerly continental distribution of
   its juveniles. The claim of Johannes Schmidt in 1931 that the European
   C. conger spawns across the North Atlantic into the western Sargasso Sea
   is probably incorrect, because leptocephali of Conger are rare in the
   eastern Sargasso Sea and because C. triporiceps, with myomere numbers
   overlapping those of C conger, was recently described in the western
   North Atlantic. With increasing size, leptocephali of C oceanicus and a
   portion of C triporiceps spread westward and northward in the Florida
   Current and Gulf Stream, but larger leptocephali especially of C.
   triporiceps are found also in the Caribbean and Gulf of Mexico. Spawning
   of C. oceanicus in the Sargasso Sea indicates that adults cross the
   Florida Current-Gulf Stream, and successful leptocephali cross the
   current in the opposite direction to colonize juvenile habitat on the
   continental shelf, a migratory pattern similar to that of the American
   eel Anguilla rostrata (Anguillidae).

AB The study area is close to the Wallis and Futuna Islands in the French
   EEZ. It exists on the western boundary of the fastest tectonic area in
   the world at the junction of the Lau and North-Fiji basins. At this
   place, the unstable back-arc accommodates the plate motion in three
   ways: (i) the north Fiji transform fault, (ii) numerous unstable
   spreading ridges, and (iii) large areas of recent volcanic activity.
   This instability creates bountiful opportunity for hydrothermal
   discharge to occur. Based on geochemical (CH4, TDM, He-3) and
   geophysical (nephelometry) tracer surveys: (1) no hydrothermal activity
   could be found on the Futuna Spreading Centre (FSC) which sets the
   western limit of hydrothermal activity; (2) four distinct hydrothermal
   active areas were identified: Kulo Lasi Caldera, Amanaki Volcano, Fatu
   Kapa and Tasi Tulo areas; (3) extensive and diverse hydrothermal
   manifestations were observed and especially a 2D distribution of the
   sources. At Kulo Lasi, our data and especially tracer ratios (CH4/He-3
   similar to 50 x 10(6) and CH4/TDM similar to 4.5) reveal a transient CH4
   input, with elevated levels of CH4 measured in 2010, that had vanished
   in 2011, most likely caused by an eruptive magmatic event. By contrast
   at Amanalci, vertical tracer profiles and tracer ratios point to typical
   seawater/basalt interactions. Fatu Kapa is characterised by a
   substantial spatial variability of the hydrothermal water column
   anomalies, most likely due to widespread focused and diffuse
   hydrothermal discharge in the area. In the Tasi Tulo zone, the
   hydrothermal signal is characterised by a total lack of turbidity,
   although other tracer anomalies are in the same range as in nearby Fatu
   Kapa. The background data set revealed the presence of a Mn and He-3
   chronic plume due to the extensive and cumulative venting over the
   entire area. To that respect, we believe that the joined domain composed
   of our active area and the nearby active area discovered in the East by
   Lupton et al. (2012) highly contribute to the extensive Tonga-Fiji plume
   and which thus may not originate from a sole source near the Samoa. Our
   results also emphasize and support the idea that back-arc hydrothermal
   systems have a significant input to the regional and global ocean and
   maybe more important than their MOR analogues. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Insects and terrestrial invertebrates are presumed to have consistently
   contributed to the diet of our ancestors and it is estimated that nearly
   2,000 insects still contribute worldwide to human nutrition. As
   elsewhere in the tropical world, insects are a part of the diet of West
   Papua (ex-Irian Jaya) populations. The distribution of insect food
   consumption on the western half of the island of New Guinea follows
   different patterns, depending on the environment and population
   subsistence economy. In the forest biome of the peripheral montane
   areas, many different insect species are collected but in small numbers,
   mainly by women and children. In-sect collection occurs by chance, but
   is frequent, and possibly helps those most vulnerable to food shortages
   to complement their diet with some extra protein and fat. In the western
   lowlands, a complex cultural system is centered around the traditional
   staple: sago (Metroxylon sagu and M. rumphii). The pith of this palm,
   which grows spontaneously in the swampy forest plains, contains a high
   amount of starch and is easily gathered by the local people. The beetle
   Rhynchophorus ferrugineus papuanus is strictly associated with the sago
   palm and oviposits especially on damaged or felled trees. Villagers so
   manage the sago palms to in cease palm-worm oviposition and to collect a
   consistent number of larvae about 6 weeks later. This ancient sago
   culture, favored by an abundant and reliable resource, has developed a
   rich ceremonial life connected with sago larvae consumption. Ecological,
   economic, and cultural factors influencing the variety of insect
   consumption modalities are taken into account here. The development of
   local, small-scale invertebrate breeding systems can contribute to the
   development of sustainable, renewable resources, and protect tropical
   forests from degradation.

   over 300 families in 20 communities in Tari to acquire a water supply,
   sanitation, nutritional gardens and small livestock, and provided health
   education. The program demonstrated that with appropriate assistance
   local people could improve their health and start small projects that
   promise real development in their communities. The extension of this
   experience is occurring under Community-Based Health Care in several
   highlands provinces. However, FHRIP had to overcome many internal and
   external obstacles, and more commitment from the public sector, together
   with long-term assistance from aid agencies, is required if such
   initiatives are to grow and flourish.

AB Sao Tome holds 20 endemic bird species, including the little known and
   "Critically Endangered' Dwarf Olive Ibis Bostrychia bocagei, Sao Tome
   Fiscal Lanius newtoni and Sao Tome Grosbeak Neospiza concolor. We
   conducted a systematic survey of the core forest area, performing 1,680
   point counts and compiling occasional observations, which enabled the
   identification of new areas of occurrence for the target species. MaxEnt
   distribution modelling suggested that the ibis and fiscal have roughly
   half of the potential area of occurrence that had been assumed (127 and
   117 km(2), respectively), while it more than doubled that of the
   grosbeak (187 km(2)). The south-west central region of the island, most
   of which is included in the Sao Tome Obo Natural Park, has the highest
   potential for the Critically Endangered birds. We confirmed the
   association of all target species with native forest. The ibis preferred
   high tree density, while the fiscal selected low tree density and
   intermediate altitudes. Despite very restricted ranges, population sizes
   seem to be larger than previously assumed. These results suggest that
   the fiscal and grosbeak might be better classified as 'Endangered',
   while the ibis should maintain its status under different criteria, due
   to a very restricted range during the breeding season. This work
   provides vital ecological knowledge to support conservation action
   focusing on these species and their habitats, highlighting the need to
   improve the effectiveness of the Sao Tome Obo Natural Park in protecting
   its unique biodiversity.

AB The Fly and Sepik are two of the largest rivers draining the island of
   New Guinea and among the world's large rivers in discharge and sediment
   yield. Sediment from the upper Fly River and its delta have low
   Os-187/Os-188 of 0.511-0.560, and sediments from the upper and lower
   Sepik River have even lower ratios of 0.294-0.418. Filtered waters (<
   0.45 <mu>m) from the Fly and Sepik rivers have Os-187/Os-188 Of 0.616
   and 0.335, respectively. Osmium isotopic compositions of surficial
   sediments from the Gulf of Papua (Os-187/Os-188 of 0.394-0.961) further
   demonstrate that the sediment currently supplied to the oceans from New
   Guinea is unradiogenic. The particulate and dissolved loads supplied by
   these rivers are significantly less radiogenic than that contributed to
   the oceans by rivers draining regions of old continental crust
   (Os-187/Os-188 > 1.2). Burial of Os of both seawater and riverine
   derivation occurs in conjunction with organic carbon burial in the Gulf
   of Papua. There is a negative correlation between the Os isotopic
   composition of the bulk sediment and the fraction of organic matter of
   terrestrial origin based on C isotopes. The systematic relationship
   between C and Os isotopic compositions in these samples indicates that
   organic matter is the major host of Os in tropical estuarine sediments.
   The Os/C-org of Gulf of Papua surface sediments is intermediate between
   that of other modern and ancient sediments. Approximately 10(11) mol/yr
   of C-org and 20-57 mol/yr of Os are buried in the inner shelf( < 50 m
   depth) of the Gulf of Papua over an area of only 21 000 km(2),
   corresponding to 1-3% of the global marine Os burial flux in 0.006% of
   the total sea surface area. These results suggest that a large
   proportion of the global burial flux of Os may take place in conjunction
   with the deposition of low-C-org sediments. Lowering of the Os isotopic
   composition of ambient seawater due to a large flux of unradiogenic
   riverine Os may be indicated by the Os isotopic composition of water
   from the Coral Sea (Os-187/Os-188 = 0.844) and marine sediments within
   the Gulf of Papua. The island of New Guinea is estimated to provide 4-5%
   of the global riverine Os flux, Given the very large particulate and
   dissolved flux to the oceans from rivers in the wet tropics, the effect
   of the weathering of young are-related crust in the SW Pacific is an
   important source of unradiogenic Os to modern seawater. (C) 2000

AB Land based aquaculture has the potential to mitigate future shortfalls
   of food fish supply in Solomon Islands. However, aquaculture is
   relatively new in the Pacific and such potential is hampered by a lack
   of aquaculture knowledge and practice within local cultures. A
   participatory action research approach was used to conduct on-farm
   trials with farmers in Solomon Islands to develop relevant and improved
   ways of farming and maximising productivity of the resident exotic
   tilapia Oreochromis mossambicus. During the 34 month period when the
   research was undertaken improvements were evident, through increased
   farmer participation and improved knowledge of farmers on pond design
   and fish husbandry techniques. One of the contributing factors to
   improved farmer understanding was the production of knowledge products
   which were co-developed with and based on the farmers' local context.
   Productivity of a typical 20-38 m(2) pond ranged from 726 to 1819 kg
   ha(-1) year(-1). Because 80% of this production was consumed by
   households, such ponds, producing easily harvestable small tilapia, have
   a role in supplementing household diets and contributing to improved
   nutrition at the subsistence level. While pond system productivity
   reached levels equivalent to low input tilapia ponds in other regions,
   the resident tilapia in Solomon Islands has limited opportunity for more
   than low level commercial enterprises. Established ponds are included in
   the daily livelihood tasks of both men and women and explicitly gender
   equitable approaches to partnerships with pond farmers provide
   opportunities to further increase benefits to households. A
   participatory action research approach, and the principles embodied
   therein, is recommended for further development of household aquaculture
   enterprises, regardless of species, in Solomon Islands.
   Statement of relevance: We feel that our paper makes significant and
   novel advance to the field of aquaculture by:
   (1) Presenting results of a research that shows the importance and
   potential role of aquaculture in mitigating food and nutrition security
   in locations where it is increasingly difficult to access fish based
   protein sources, even in a South Pacific location perceived to contain
   an abundance of fish.
   (2) Participatory Action Research (PAR) has been employed in agriculture
   and aquaculture in Asia and Africa in the last 20 years. We report in
   here the use of the PAR method within the Pacific Islands context in
   conducting research and developing aquaculture in a location where there
   is very little history of aquaculture within the local culture. (C) 2016

AB The variability of phytoplankton biomass in the Caribbean Sea south of
   14 degrees N and east of 80 degrees W is examined with a time series of
   high spatial resolution Coastal Zone Color Scanner (CZCS) satellite
   images. These synoptic pigment fields are compared with SST, wind, sea
   lever, and Orinoco River discharge series (1979-1982). The information
   helped outline the spatial extent of upwelling centers and their
   seasonal variability, and the influence of the Orinoco's discharge on
   the margin of the southern Caribbean Sea.
   A seasonal SST cycle was observed throughout the Caribbean, with peaks
   between August and November (ca 29 degrees C), and minima between
   January and June (ca 25.5 degrees C). Waters within 100 km of the
   continent were consistently similar to 0.5 degrees C cooler. Along-shore
   wind stress intensified from November (ca -0.05 N m(-2)) to maxima in
   April-May (ca -0.10 N m(-2)), then weakened through June and July, and
   remained low (-0.04 to -0.07 N m(-2)) until November. Low-frequency (>26
   h) filtered coastal sea level was usually below the mean (<-0.04 m)
   between January and April, near the mean between May and August, and
   then above the mean (>0.04 m) from September to November, The Orinoco
   discharged a mean 3.9 x 10(4) m(3) s(-1), ranging from 1 x 10(4) m(3)
   s(-1) in March to about 7 x 10(4) m(3) s(-1) in August.
   The data show an inverse relationship between pigment concentration and
   coastal sea level, and a direct relationship with zonal wind stress,
   both at seasonal time scales and at shorter event scales. The frequency
   and area of blooms was larger during periods of strong wind
   (January-April), and smaller during June-October. Mean pigment
   concentration was higher around Margarita (4 year mean of 1.2 mg m(-3))
   than off. central Venezuela (4 year mean of 0.45 mg m(-3)), which
   indicated that more intense upwelling occurs near the former broad
   continental shelf, where the horizontal, cross-wind scare of coastal
   upwelling may be smaller than over a narrow shelf. Pigment
   concentrations were particularly high near capes and headlands.
   Concentrations off eastern/central Venezuela and the Orinoco's flow were
   inversely related. In contrast, pigments near Tobago varied directly
   with discharge. During the first half of the year, the Orinoco plume was
   located between Trinidad and Tobago, and pigments around Tobago were low
   (<0.5 mg m(-3)). During July-November, the plume engulfed Tobago,
   Grenada and St Vincent, with values >1 mg m(-3). Interannual variation
   was evident in the series: sea level was unusually high (daily mean sea
   level up to 0.25 m) during the second half of 1979, and unusually low
   (daily mean as low as -0.20 m) in early 1980. The latter corresponded
   with extended periods of unusually strong trade winds and coincided with
   periods of extremely large patches of high pigments along the coast.

AB Accurately predicting future tropical cyclone risk requires
   understanding the fundamental controls on tropical cyclone dynamics.
   Here we present an annually-resolved 450-year reconstruction of western
   Caribbean tropical cyclone activity developed using a new coupled carbon
   and oxygen isotope ratio technique in an exceptionally well-dated
   stalagmite from Belize. Western Caribbean tropical cyclone activity
   peaked at 1650 A. D., coincident with maximum Little Ice Age cooling,
   and decreased gradually until the end of the record in 1983. Considered
   with other reconstructions, the new record suggests that the mean track
   of Cape Verde tropical cyclones shifted gradually north-eastward from
   the western Caribbean toward the North American east coast over the last
   450 years. Since similar to 1870 A. D., these shifts were largely driven
   by anthropogenic greenhouse gas and sulphate aerosol emissions. Our
   results strongly suggest that future emission scenarios will result in
   more frequent tropical cyclone impacts on the financial and population
   centres of the northeastern United States.

AB S. ocellata (sensu Bohlke and Springer, 1961) represents a species
   complex composed of 5 spp. in addition to S. guttata. S. ocellata occurs
   on both coasts of Florida north to North Carolina [USA] and questionably
   in the Bahama Islands; S. culebrae ranges from Haiti through Puerto Rico
   and down the Lesser Antilles to and including St. Vincent; S. guttata is
   found in the Tobago Cays and the Grenadines south to Trinidad and west
   to Curacao; S. brasiliensis is known from southern Brazil; S. variabilis
   sp. nov. occurs at Santa Marta, Colombia; and S. occidentalis sp. nov
   ranges from Panama north to Yucatan, Mexico, including certain offshore
   islands. Two species (S. culebrae and S. brasiliensis) are resurrected
   from the synonymy of S. ocellata. The importance of head coloration in
   this complex is discussed and examples of character displacement in
   meristic and morphometric characters are presented. The S.
   ocellata-complex probably represents a superspecies composed of 6
   allospecies. Zoogeographic implications of the superspecies are
   discussed in relation to formal provinces.

   of corals restricted to positions below sea level and those of peats to
   intertidal and higher levels, a curve bracketed by corals below and peat
   above effectively delineates the positions of a rising Holocene sea.
   From 3-11 ka, the corrected curve shifts progressively to older
   calibrated ages, reaching an similar to1-kyr increase at -21 m MSL (mean
   sea level). Elevations and calibrated ages of samples from each locality
   in the wider Caribbean region constitute an important database for
   future refinement with glacio-hydro-isostatic elevation corrections from
   3-D Earth models. In future studies of the history of western Atlantic
   coral reefs, scientists will be able to relate calibrated radiocarbon
   dates to this sea-level curve to determine paleo water depths and rates
   of sea-level rise.

AB There is global concern about tropical forest degradation, in part,
   because of the associated loss of biodiversity. Communities and
   indigenous people play a fundamental role in tropical forest management
   and are often efficient at preventing forest degradation. However,
   monitoring changes in biodiversity due to degradation, especially at a
   scale appropriate to local tropical forest management, is plagued by
   difficulties, including the need for expert training, inconsistencies
   across observers, and lack of baseline or reference data. We used a new
   biodiversity remote-sensing technology, the recording of soundscapes, to
   test whether the acoustic saturation of a tropical forest in Papua New
   Guinea decreases as land-use intensity by the communities that manage
   the forest increases. We sampled soundscapes continuously for 24 hours
   at 34 sites in different land-use zones of 3 communities. Land-use zones
   where forest cover was fully retained had significantly higher
   soundscape saturation during peak acoustic activity times (i.e., dawn
   and dusk chorus) compared with land-use types with fragmented forest
   cover. We conclude that, in Papua New Guinea, the relatively simple
   measure of soundscape saturation may provide a cheap, objective,
   reproducible, and effective tool for monitoring tropical forest
   deviation from an intact state, particularly if it is used to detect the
   presence of intact dawn and dusk choruses.

AB We used Sea-viewing Wide Field-of-view Sensor (SeaWiFS) to document the
   seasonal cycle of surface chlorophyll in the western tropical Pacific.
   Surface waters in this region can be divided into two ecosystems. The
   western end of the cold, salty waters of the cold tongue with high
   nutrient low chlorophyll (HNLC) characteristics occupies most of the
   eastern part Of the region, while warm, fresh, and oligotrophic waters
   of the warm pool stand in the western part. Nevertheless, disruption of
   the oligotrophy may show up at different locations. We reconstructed the
   seasonal cycle of chlorophyll, sea surface temperature (SST), winds, and
   surface currents from satellite data and satellite-derived products by
   extracting the annual and semi-annual harmonics of the time series at
   each grid point. The calculation was done for the 1999-2004 years in
   order to exclude the consequences of the major 1997-1998 El Nino
   Southern Oscillation event. The variance explained by the seasonal cycle
   for this period highlights three regions with high seasonality: (1) The
   oligotrophy/HNLC transition zone undergoes meridional seasonal
   displacements. The cold tongue is at its northernmost (southernmost)
   position during boreal spring (fall). These displacements can be
   explained in terms of meridional advection of chlorophyll-rich waters
   and are consistent with the seasonal cycle of the north and south
   equatorial countercurrents that transport phytoplankton-poor waters. (2)
   Ocean-color images show seasonal enrichments in the far western north
   equatorial countercurrent (NECC) area, especially during boreal spring.
   The chlorophyll maximum coincides with the maximum NECC velocity,
   follows a SST minimum, and occurs during the upwelling-favorable phase
   of the wind stress curl. We attribute these enrichments to local
   upwelling associated with current meandering, horizontal advection from
   further west, and transport of nutrient-rich waters by the New Guinea
   coastal undercurrent. (3) Near the Solomon Archipelago, we observe
   enhancements of chlorophyll concentration southwest of the islands in
   austral winter, when both the southwestward surface currents and the
   southeasterly wind stress are strongest. This may be a combination of an
   island-mass effect and wind-driven upwelling. Horizontal advection from
   the Solomon area leads to an almost concurrent seasonal chlorophyll
   enrichment in the northern Coral Sea. In the Gulf of Papua, high
   chlorophyll concentrations at the same time can be explained by the
   presence of a strong cyclonic circulation. This study highlights the
   richness of the response of surface chlorophyll to physical processes at
   the seasonal time scale in a region usually acknowledged as
   oligotrophic. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB A reconnaissance survey was conducted at 18 reef sites spanning 250 km-2
   on the windward margin of the Caicos Bank from June to August, 1991.
   Five main reef types were identified from aerial imagery on the eastern
   Caicos Bank: patch reefs, transitional reefs, high-relief spur and
   groove, low-relief spur and groove, and fore reef escarpment. Reef types
   differed in colony density and coral coverage, although most sites were
   dominated by Montastraea annularis (Ellis and Solander), M. cavernosa
   (Linnaeus), Porites astreoides Lesueur, P. porites (Pallas), Siderastrea
   siderea (Ellis and Solander), and Agaricia agaricites (Linnaeus). Many
   of these species are dominant in Caribbean reef systems. Surveys along a
   north to south transect on the windward margin of the Caicos Bank
   revealed that corals in patch reefs and spur and groove reefs decreased
   in colony abundance and coverage. This gradient may be related to
   differences in wave energy among reefs adjacent to islands in the north
   and the relatively exposed reefs on the southeastern margin of the bank.
   Overall, reefs on the eastern Caicos Bank had lower coral cover ( lt
   15%) than in other western Atlantic reef systems. A north to south
   transect along the eastern side of the bank suggests that reef
   distribution and composition reflects the pattern of wave energy and
   tidal transport from the bank to oceanic waters. Sites adjacent to
   islands generally had greater species richness, density, and coverage of
   corals. Thirty-three hermatypic scleractinian coral species were
   recorded among 13 reef sites on the eastern Caicos Bank. The coral
   assemblage observed in the Turks and Caicos is similar to coral species
   lists compiled from some areas in the Bahamian archipelago. Species
   lists from historical surveys of western Atlantic reefs were compiled
   for 20 locations in the biogeographic province.

AB Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to identify the demographic
   characteristics that influence the choice of retail outlet and the
   preferred retail outlet used by primary household shoppers when
   purchasing roots and tubers (R&Ts).
   Design/methodology/approach - The study uses a binary logit model to
   estimate the probability of being a traditional or modern outlet shopper
   for R&Ts.
   Findings - The traditional retail outlet was the preferred place to
   purchase R&Ts. Three demographic variables, age, monthly family income
   and ethnicity, were statistically significant.
   Research limitations/implications - The sample size might be considered
   small with only 232 primary household food shoppers participating.
   Originality/value - To date, minimal research on the marketing of R&Ts
   has been undertaken in Trinidad and Tobago. As such, it is hoped that
   this study will stimulate others to undertake research in this area.

AB Background. The agreement on agriculture and the World Trade
   Organization were major outcomes of the 1986-1994 Uruguay Round (UR)
   negotiations within the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT).
   The measures under the UR were predicted to increase poverty in
   developing countries, a serious cause for concern since poverty
   alleviation is a major goal of developing countries. Thus this paper
   simulated the impact on poverty of the UR for a net food importing
   country, Trinidad and Tobago.
   Objective. The objectives of the study were to determine the changes in
   poverty levels in Trinidad and Tobago that we expected would result from
   changes in the price levels of food commodities after the removal of
   trade protection following the UR, and to examine recent trends in
   poverty in Trinidad and Tobago and the prices of major agricultural
   exports from the United States, its principal trading partner.
   Methods. A regression model (poverty model) was used to determine the
   relationship between poverty levels and the prices of sensitive imported
   food commodities (SIFCs) and other key economic variables. Impact models
   were used to project changes in world market prices of the SIFCs due to
   the UR, and these price changes were used to predict changes in poverty
   in Trinidad and Tobago.
   Results. The results showed a positive elasticity between poverty and
   the prices of SIFCs. The study also predicted that the average projected
   increase in price levels of the SIFCs of less than 9% by the year 2000
   would cause an increase in poverty in Trinidad and Tobago of less than
   4%.
   Conclusions. There has been, in fact, a small decline in poverty in
   Trinidad and Tobago since 1996. The prices of major agricultural exports
   from the United States have also been falling since 1995. Thus, so far
   the UR has had no perceptible effects in increasing the prices of food
   exports from the United States. Also, so far the UR has had no
   perceptible effect on the poverty level in Trinidad and Tobago.

   in Papua New Guinea Highlands where sweet potatoes contributed
   approximately 50% of the total protein intake. Major cultivars of sweet
   potatoes in the Tari basin and the Asaro valley, 15 in total, were
   sampled and their nitrogen and amino acid contents were analyzed. Sweet
   potatoes in the Tari basin and the Asaro valley contained, respectively,
   1.4% and 0.8% of protein in fresh weight basis. The concentration was
   1.7 times higher in the former than in the latter (t-test,p<.01). The
   first limiting amino acid was leucine in the samples from both areas and
   amino acid scores were 87 in the Tari samples and 85 in the Asaro
   samples, using values of FAO/WHO (1973). Protein content and amino acid
   scores of sweet potatoes in the Tari basin were higher than those
   previously reported in Papua New Guinea Highlands probably because of
   introduction of new cultivars in recent decades, and thus protein intake
   of the inhabitants may have been increased.

AB Twenty-two species of Nothofagus were collected from South America, New
   Zealand, Australia, New Guinea and New Caledonia and grown under common
   conditions in controlled environment growth cabinets. This enabled us to
   measure genetically determined differences in carbon isotope
   discrimination (DELTA) of leaves. Discrimination is a long-term measure
   of intercellular CO2 levels and estimate of water-use efficiency. It is
   known to be positively related to intercellular CO2 concentration and
   stomatal conductance and negatively related to CO2 assimilation rate and
   water-use efficiency. Genetic differences were then explored in relation
   to the native environments of the individual species. The species
   originating from tropical latitudes showed less discrimination
   (16.5-19.8 parts per thousand) than the species originating from higher
   latitudes (20.9-23.5 parts per thousand). There were no differences
   between the ranges of values recorded in species native to New Zealand,
   Australia or South America over a similar latitudinal range.
   When the DELTA-values of some species from Australia, New Guinea, New
   Caledonia and New Zealand (grown under common conditions) were regressed
   against climate parameters of their native environment, the highest
   correlation was obtained with mean rainfall from December to March (r2 =
   0.81). It is hypothesized that the species at high latitudes, where the
   warmest months are usually the driest, have evolved physiological and/or
   morphological mechanisms which allow continued water uptake and high
   stomatal conductance during periods of mild water deficit. This would
   allow the continuation of photosynthesis and potentially higher net
   productivity under these conditions than in species which close their
   stomata in response to relatively small water deficits. In climates
   where water deficits are rare, stomatal sensitivity may allow some
   avoidance of mild water stress, without the larger costs imposed by
   other adaptations.

AB The Atlantic hurricanes of 1999 caused widespread environmental damage
   throughout the Caribbean and US mid-Atlantic coastal regions. However,
   these storms also proved beneficial to certain microbial habitats;
   specifically, cyanobacteria-dominated mats. Modern mats represent the
   oldest known biological communities on earth, stromatolites.
   Contemporary mats are dominant biological communities in the hypersaline
   Bahamian lakes along the Atlantic hurricane track. We examined the
   impacts of varying levels of hypersalinity on 2 processes controlling
   mat growth, photosynthesis and nitrogen fixation, in Salt Pond, San
   Salvador Island, Bahamas. Hypersalinity (> 5 times sea-water salinity)
   proved highly inhibitory to these processes. Freshwater input from
   Hurricane Floyd and other large storms alleviated this salt-inhibition.
   A predicted 10 to 40 year increase in Atlantic hurricane activity
   accompanied by more frequent "freshening" events will enhance mat
   productivity, CO2 sequestration and nutrient cycling. Cyanobacterial
   mats are sensitive short- and long-term indicators of climatic and
   ecological changes impacting these and other waterstressed environments.

AB Swath bathymetric, sonar imagery and seismic reflection data collected
   during the SOPACMAPS cruise Leg 3 over segments of the Vitiaz Trench
   Lineament and adjacent areas provide new insights on the geometry and
   the stuctural evolution of this seismically inactive lineament. The
   Vitiaz Trench Lineament, although largely unknown, is one of the most
   important tectonic Feature in the SW Pacific because it separates the
   Cretaceous crust of the Pacific Plate to the north from the Cenozoic
   lithosphere of the North Fiji and Lau Basins to the south. The lineament
   is considered to be the convergent plate boundary between the Pacific
   and Australian Plates during midde to late Tertiary time when the Vitiaz
   Are was a continuous east-facing are from the Tonga to the Solomon
   Islands before the development of the North Fiji and Lau Basins.
   Progressive reversal and cessation of subduction from west to east in
   the Late Miocene-Lower Plioene have been also proposed. However, precise
   structures and age of initiation an. cessation of deformation along the
   Vitiaz Trench Lineament are unknown.
   The lineament consists of the Vitiaz Trench and three discontinuous and
   elongated troughs (Alexa, Rotuma and Home Troughs) which connect the
   Vitiaz Trench to the northern end of the Tonga Trench. Our survey of the
   Alexa and Rotuma Troughs reveals that the lineament is composed of a
   series of WNW-ESE and ENE-WSW trending segments in front of large
   volcanic massifs belonging to the Melanesian Border Plateau, a WNW
   trending volcanic belt of seamounts and ridges on Pacific crust. The
   Plateau and Pacific plate lying immediately north of the lineament have
   been affected by intense normal faulting, collapse, and volcanism as
   evidenced by a series of tilted blocks, grabens, horsts and ridges
   trending N 120 degrees to N 100 degrees and N 60 degrees-70 degrees.
   This tectonism includes several normal faulting episodes, the latest
   being very recent and possibly still active. The trend of the fault
   scarps and volcanic ridges parallels the different segments of the
   Vitiaz Trench Lineament, suggesting that tectonics and volcanism are
   related to crustal motion along the lineament.
   Although the superficial observed features are mainly extensional, they
   are interpreted as the result of shortening along the Vitiaz Trench
   Lineament. The fabric north of the lineament would result from
   subduction-induced normal faulting on the outer wall of the trench and
   the zig-zag geometry of the Vitiaz Trench Lineament might be due to
   collision of large volcanic edifices of the Melanesian Border Plateau
   with the trench, provoking trench segmentation along left-lateral
   ENE-WSW trending transform zones. The newly acquired bathymetric and
   seismic data suggest that crustal motion (tectonism associated with
   volcanism) continued up to recent times along the Vitiaz Trench
   Lineament and was active during the development of the North Fiji Basin.

AB A collection of Paguroidea recently obtained during deep-water
   expeditions along the coast of Brazil, forms the basis of this report.
   Of the 14 species reported from Brazil, 11 represent range extensions to
   the south, and one, Michelopagurus atlanticus (Bouvier, 1922), is a
   first record for the western Atlantic. The specimens were compared with
   types and western Atlantic materials deposited in various major museums.
   A diagnosis and illustrations are presented for each of seven species
   found to be poorly or insufficiently known. New material and information
   is reported for two additional species that occur in Brazil but not
   found in the recent deep-water collections: Clibanarius symmetricus
   (Randall, 1840) and Mixtopagurus paradoxus A. Milne-Edwards, 1880.
   Remarkable and unique color photographs of live or fresh specimens of
   Allodardanus bredini Haig & Provenzano, 1965, Bathynarius anomalus (A.
   Milne-Edwards & Bouvier, 1893), Pylopagurus discoidalis (A.
   Milne-Edwards, 1880), Paguristes spinipes A. Milne-Edwards, 1880,
   Parapagurus pilosimanus Smith, 1876, and P. alaminos Lemaitre, 1986, are
   presented. A review of published records and museum collections of the
   terrestrial Coenobita clypeatus (Fabricius, 1787), has shown that the
   southern range limit of this species does not extend beyond the southern
   Caribbean and Trinidad and Tobago, and thus does not occur on the
   Brazilian coast as previously believed. A distribution map of C.
   clypeatus is provided based on specimens in the collections of the
   National Museum of Natural History, Smithsonian Institution. New
   distribution records in the Gulf of Mexico and southern Caribbean, and
   morphological information, are included for Pagurus rotundimanus Wass,
   1963, a species originally described from the Florida Keys but rarely
   reported since. Relevant remarks on the taxonomy, morphology, and
   distribution of all these species are included. The revised list of
   Paguroidea known from Brazil is updated, and now includes a total of 62
   species in the families Pylochelidae (1), Diogenidae (27), Paguridae
   (28), and Parapaguridae (6). A synopsis of primary taxonomic works on
   western Atlantic Paguroidea is also presented.

AB Recent research in the Ivane Valley has shown that it was first occupied
   during the late Pleistocene between 43-49,000 years cal. BP, making this
   area one of the earliest colonised in Papua New Guinea. At an altitude
   of 2000 metres above sea level, occupation also marks the first time
   that modern humans pushed into the high altitude montane regions within
   Sahul. Part of the process of familiarisation with a landscape involves
   the identification of lithic sources. The importance of lithic sources
   for the landscape learning process is that, unlike plant foods and
   animals, it can be assumed that the colonisers had little a priori
   knowledge of their location before arriving in a particular landscape.
   If lithic sources are available, then their successful use would require
   a process of learning the locations and properties of the different raw
   material sources, thus creating an intimate level of knowledge of a
   landscape. By examining how modern humans familiarised themselves with
   the Ivane landscape through the use of lithic sources, we may be able to
   understand further the processes of colonisation and adaptation to
   particular landscapes.

AB The southeast region of the Gulf of Mexico is considered to be
   biologically important, because it is a connection and transition zone
   between the Caribbean and the Gulf of Mexico, harboring great marine
   biodiversity. Nevertheless, benthic amphipods have been poorly studied
   in the Mexican southeast sector of the Gulf of Mexico with few studies
   listing species. The aim of this study is to provide an update checklist
   of species for the Mexican southeast sector (based on literature review
   and records from the present study) as well as a brief zoogeographical
   analysis for the Gulf of Mexico amphipod fauna, putting them in context
   with the fauna on the tropical western Atlantic. Fifty-five species were
   listed for the Mexican southeast sector; 36 of them showed a
   geographical extension to the Yucatan continental shelf representing 23
   new records for the Mexican southeast sector, nine for the southeast
   region and four for the Gulf of Mexico. Based on the zoogeographical
   analysis, there is support of the application of Carolinian and
   Caribbean zoogeographic provinces to amphipods in the Gulf of Mexico.

PD FAL 1999

AB Papua New Guinea's Sandline affair provides the most dramatic
   illustration of militarization among the Pacific Island states. Although
   this was the first resort to mercenaries, there have been other examples
   of PNG governments hiring private military contractors for assistance in
   internal security matters. Recent years have seen an increasing reliance
   on militaristic solutions to crime and other forms of conflict. This
   trend is partly a response to the well-documented weaknesses of the
   police and defense forces. Political leaders have shown a marked
   preference for "tough," "quick-fix" solutions. Reliance on militaristic
   responses can, at one level, be viewed as a way of compensating for
   state weakness by relying on its ostensibly strongest aspect. At the
   same time, the militaristic orientation of government actions in this
   area cannot be separated from wider societal tolerance of violence as a
   strategy for resolving conflict. Militaristic solutions have not only
   failed to resolve problems of order but have often ended up aggravating
   them. They have also had a debilitating impact on many of the government
   agencies concerned. Ministerial autonomy allows senior political leaders
   to initiate and pursue militaristic schemes that have often been little
   more than vehicles for the advancement of the individual leader's
   electoral and other interests. Such initiatives in the area of internal
   security illustrate the reinforcing nexus between political patronage
   and the weakness of the PNG state.

   highly siliceous hardwood. Similarly treated hardwood, in which soft rot
   activity is reduced, is unattacked (with 1 minor exception). Standard
   trial methods for timber, treated for marine use, place the timber below

AB The Caribbean archipelago is a mosaic of languages, cultures, and
   cuisines, resulting in differential preferences regarding foods,
   including fruits. The relative importance of fruit crops in the
   Caribbean depends on their value as export crops and on their value in
   domestic markets. Several fruit crops were commercially important (with
   ups and downs) in many Caribbean islands throughout most of the 20(th)
   century and even before, remaining important to date and possibly for
   decades to come. Other crops have been important in one or several
   islands, but not in the other islands of the Caribbean. This paper is a
   review of fruit crops, situations and tendencies in Puerto Rico, the
   Dominican Republic, and Haiti.

AB Secure and sanitary water supply is essential for human health and
   well-being. The challenges in meeting this demand are great in Small
   Island Developing States where water resources may be limited due to
   social and environmental constraints. In Honiara, Solomon Islands, a
   number of factors have constrained access to fresh water including:
   rapid population growth and urbanisation; neglected water
   infrastructure; the ethnic tensions; water tariff increases of 170% in
   the past 3 years; sole reliance on groundwater; and poor supporting
   electrical infrastructure. Within this context, the case for using
   rainwater tanks as either a predominant source or for augmentation of
   existing domestic water supply has been explored. The effect of
   historical drought events on rainwater tanks has been examined. A water
   balance model has been developed and various household scenarios
   reviewed to determine the reliability of domestic rainwater tanks over a
   28-year period. The development of this model has highlighted both
   opportunities and limitations in Honiara that can be used to inform
   decision-makers and planners in water resources management.

AB Sixty ''buliminid'' species are recorded from five different
   physiographic settings within the Papuan Lagoon, southeast coast of New
   Guinea. Buliminids rarely make up more than 5% of the total
   foraminiferal content of the sediment, and individual species rarely
   exceed 1% of the foraminiferal assemblages at any site. Their small test
   size and low abundance make buliminids inconspicuous components of the
   microfauna. The most diverse assemblages come from the northwest slope
   of Horseshoe Reef (medium-coarse sand, 16-53 m water depth; 45 species),
   from the lagoon basin to the north and west of Motupore Island (mud,
   15-38 m water depth; 44 species), and from the fore-reef slope of the
   fringing reef along the western side of Motupore Island (sand to mud
   downslope, 10-20 m water depth; 39 species). The least diverse
   assemblages are from the back-reef flat of Motupore Island
   (medium-coarse sand, < 1.5 m water depth; 16 species) and the eastern
   channel between Motupore Island and the mainland (medium-coarse sand, <
   10 m water depth; 15 species). Analysis of the distributions of common
   species suggests that some occur across a broad facies range (e.g.,
   Loxostomina limbata, Sagrinella lobata, Siphogenerina raphana, Floresina
   cf. milletti, Buliminoides williamsonianus, Fijiella gr. aculeata,
   Trimosina gr. spinulosa, Sigmavirgulina tortuosa, Brizalina cf.
   spathulata, Brizalina gr. striatula, ''Bolivinita'' rhomboidalis)
   whereas others are confined mostly to either sand facies (e.g.,
   Siphouvigerina porrecta, Trifarina cf. bradyi) or mud facies (e.g.,
   Stainforthia sp., Neouvigerina sp., Fursenkoina schreibersiana). Some
   appear to have a bathymetric preference within parts of the inner
   neritic zone (e.g., Cassidelina capitata, Hopkinsinella glabra,
   Loxostomina mayori, ''Sagrina'' gr. convallarium, Siphouvigerina
   porrecta, Trifarina cf. bradyi, ''Amphimorphina'' virgula, and
   ''Bolivina'' subtenuis occur at water depths mostly below 10 m).

AB Separate predictive models are created for the Caribbean early wet
   season (May-June-July) and late wet season (August-September-October).
   Simple correlations are used to select predictors for a Caribbean
   rainfall index and predictive equations are formulated using multiple
   linear regression. The process is repeated after long term trends are
   removed from the Caribbean rainfall index and the models validated using
   a number of statistical methods. Four variables are confirmed as
   predictors for the early season: Caribbean sea surface temperature
   anomalies, tropical North Atlantic sea level pressure anomalies,
   vertical shear anomalies in the equatorial Atlantic, and the size of the
   Atlantic portion of the Western Hemisphere Warm Pool. Only the first two
   are retained in the late season model. On the interannual time-scale,
   equatorial Pacific sea surface temperature anomalies become significant
   in both seasons. The NINO3 index is retained among the predictors for
   the early season, and zonal gradients of sea surface temperature between
   the equatorial Pacific and tropical Atlantic are retained for the late
   season. The results also indicate spatial variation in the importance of
   the seasonal predictors.

AB The semienclosed Solomon Sea is the final passage in the equatorward
   transit of the South Pacific western boundary currents (WBCs) that play
   a key role in heat and mass budgets of the equatorial Pacific. The
   Solomon WBCs and their associated water properties are examined using
   data from two oceanographic cruises undertaken during the contrasting
   trade wind seasons: July 2012 and March 2014. The mean circulation and
   associated transports with uncertainties is determined from the cruise
   data using a unique configuration of an inverse box model formulated
   based on measured shipboard acoustic Doppler current profiler
   velocities. An intense inflow of 36 Sv is found entering the Solomon Sea
   in July-August 2012 that falls by 70% to 11 Sv in March 2014. Large
   differences are also found in the total transport partitioning through
   each of the major exit passages during each season. Different water
   masses are found in the WBC stream northeast of the Solomon Islands that
   are likely related to a northern stream of the South Equatorial Current.
   Within the Solomon Sea, isopycnal salinity gradients are gradually
   stronger than within the subtropical Pacific, likely induced by stronger
   diapycnal mixing processes. WBC pathways exhibit distinct water mass
   signatures in salinity, oxygen, and nutrients that can be traced across
   the Solomon Sea, associated with significant water mass modifications at
   the northern exit straits and south of the Woodlark Island.

AB Sustainable development in small island developing countries often
   hinges upon the successful adoption and diffusion of energy technologies
   developed abroad. To guide investments and policies seeking to promote
   new energy efficiency technologies academic and marketing studies often
   rely upon consumer self-reports of willingness to pay (WTP) for the
   environmental and economic benefits such technologies may provide. But
   marketing research has long reported disparities between consumer
   self-reports of willingness to pay and the actual amounts consumers will
   pay when making a purchase decision. This study uses the results of a
   survey and associated coupon distribution in Saint Lucia to contrast
   self-reported willingness to pay for energy-efficient compact
   fluorescent light bulbs (CFLs) with actual consumer behavior in a
   developing country context. Survey responses suggested that more than
   94% of urban consumers in Saint Lucia were willing to pay some price
   premium for a high quality CFL bulb. However, when given a coupon
   allowing them to purchase a CFL bulb at a price equal to or below their
   self-reported willingness to pay, only one-third of the consumers
   actually purchased the product. High income respondents, low income
   respondents, and younger respondents were among those most likely to not
   purchase a CFL bulb when offered the chance to do so at or below their
   self-reported willingness to pay. The presence of systematic
   discrepancies between self-reported willingness to pay and observed
   consumer behavior in CFL markets has important implications for energy
   efficiency market research, coupon-based incentive programs and energy
   policy in Saint Lucia and other developing nations. (C) 2015

AB The international trade in wildlife is currently one of the greatest
   threats to biodiversity. One group, the turtles, has experienced
   far-reaching population declines and extinctions because the majority of
   animals are sourced from the wild. The island of New Guinea has the
   highest diversity of freshwater turtles (Chelidae) in the Australasian
   region and large numbers are harvested from the Indonesian province of
   Papua to supply the international pet trade. A total of 264 of these
   turtles representing six species were recorded between December 2010 and
   March 2011 while gathering information about wildlife trade in the
   Indonesian province of Papua. Most were juveniles, although a
   substantial number of large adults were also harvested. None of the
   species recorded are CITES-listed. Despite one species not being
   allocated an annual harvest quota, it was observed being traded. Illegal
   and unregulated trade coupled with a lack of basic ecological data for
   these species can have a severe impact on wild populations. We present
   recommendations for law enforcement and conservation of these species.

AB Rodents on islands are usually thought of by conservationists mainly in
   reference to invasive pest species, which have wrought considerable
   ecological damage on islands around the globe. However, almost one in
   five of the world's nearly 2300 rodent species is an island endemic, and
   insular rodents suffer from high rates of extinction and endangerment.
   Rates of Quaternary extinction and current threat are especially high in
   the West Indies and the species-rich archipelagos of Southeast Asia.
   Rodent endemism reaches its most striking levels on large or remote
   oceanic islands, such as Madagascar, the Caribbean, the Ryukyu Islands,
   the oceanic Philippines, Sulawesi, the Galapagos, and the Solomon
   Islands, as well as on very large land-bridge islands, especially New
   Guinea. While conservation efforts in the past and present have focused
   mainly on charismatic mammals (such as birds and large mammals), efforts
   specifically targeted toward less conspicuous animals (such as insular
   rodents) may be necessary to stem large numbers of extinctions in the
   near future. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd and INQUA. All rights reserved.

AB Spatial and temporal distribution patterns of polychaete assemblages
   were described in six subtidal sampling stations within Cienfuegos Bay,
   a Cuban semi-enclosed bay in the Caribbean Sea for 4 months (February
   and September 2006, February and May 2007). This bay is strongly
   polluted due to the accumulation of organic enrichment and heavy metals
   in sediments. Macrofaunal assemblages were impoverished and their
   distribution highly patchy across stations and months. Molluscs,
   arthropods and echinoderms were scarce, but small-size opportunistic
   polychaete species such as Polydora sp. and Streblospio benedicti were
   predominant. The synergistic effects of low hydrodynamics and hypoxia
   derived from organic enrichment probably explain the distribution
   patterns of macrofauna. Heavy metal contamination appears to have minor
   effects on fauna; low bioavailability of metals and tolerance of fauna
   can explain this hypothesis. Seasonal changes of macrofauna can be
   related to water stagnation in the wet (summer) period and concomitant
   increase of hypoxia. Clear symptoms of eutrophication related to organic
   enrichment and a depleted macrofauna suggest a threatened ecosystem
   where management actions have to be applied urgently.

   poisonings (CFP) in Madeira and Canary Islands appear to be particularly
   related with consumption of fish caught close to Selvagens Islands, a

   the highest value of 0.25 mu g C-CTX1 kg(-1) in a 4.6 kg island grouper
   (Mycteroperca fusca). This study indicates that a diversity of fish from
   different trophic levels contains CTXs, Selvagens appear to be one of
   the most favorable locations for CTXs food web transfer and finally,
   this study highlights the need of further research based on intensive
   environmental and biological sampling on these remote islands.

AB Economic benefits are derived from sea turtle tourism all over the

   in Tobago. We use a choice experiment to estimate the value of sea
   turtle encounters to recreational SCUBA divers and the contingent
   valuation method to estimate the value of sea turtles to international
   tourists. Results indicate that turtle encounters were the most
   important dive attribute among those examined. Divers are willing to pay
   over US$62 per two tank dive for the first turtle encounter. The mean
   WTP for turtle conservation among international visitors to Tobago was
   US$31.13 which reflects a significant non-use value associated with
   actions targeted at keeping sea turtles from going extinct. These
   results illustrate significant non-use and non-consumptive use value of
   sea turtles, and highlight the importance of sea turtle conservation
   efforts in Tobago and throughout the Caribbean region. (C) 2017 Elsevier

AB Identifying priority areas for biodiversity conservation requires
   systematic approaches and integrated ecological and biological
   information. Here, we applied a range of ecological criteria to assess
   areas of biodiversity importance in the Coral Triangle region, a
   priority region for marine biodiversity conservation because of its high
   species richness and endemicity. We used distribution data of three
   biogenic habitats to assess the criterion of sensitive habitat, modeled
   geographic distributions of 10,672 species ranges and occurrence records
   of 19,251 species to evaluate the criterion of species richness,
   distributions of 834 species of special conservation concern to examine
   the criterion of species of conservation concern, distributions of 373
   reef fish species to assess the criterion of restricted-range species,
   and distribution of nesting sites and migratory route of six species of
   sea turtle to evaluate the criterion of areas of importance for
   particular life history stages. We identified areas of biodiversity
   importance by superimposing each of the different criterion. We
   performed two tiers of multi criteria analysis: (1) a Coral Triangle
   regional level analysis to identify "clustered hotspots" (i.e., groups
   of cells) of biodiversity significance, and (2) a site-based analysis to
   identify the specific sites (cells) of greatest biodiversity importance.
   We found that approximately 13% of the Coral Triangle was clustered into
   hotspots of high biodiversity importance. These areas occurred along the
   southern part of the Philippines, the north-eastern part of Malaysian
   Sabah, central to eastern reaches of Indonesia, the eastern part of
   Papua New Guinea and the Solomon Islands. By comparison, the site-based
   analysis identified seven sites of highest biodiversity importance in
   the Coral Triangle include: (1) the northern tip of Sulawesi Island, (2)
   Ambon Island, (3) Kei Islands, (4) Raja Ampat Archipelago of Indonesian
   Papua, (5) the Verde Island Passage, (6) the southern part of Negros
   Island, and (7) Cebu Island. This information is useful to inform
   participatory decision-making processes in the Coral Triangle region to
   identify priority areas for conservation and management.

AB The presence of two endemic Sargassum spp., Sargassum filipendula and
   Sargassum vulgare, along the eastern coasts of Trinidad and Tobago were
   investigated to assess the pollution status of those localities. Heavy
   metal and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAHs) concentrations in these
   marine organisms were determined. Average concentrations of Cd, Cu, Fe,
   Mn, Ni, Pb, and Zn were 4.59, 5.05, 744.98, 69.10, 8.33, 8.59, and 24.30
   mu g g(-1) (dry wt.) in S. filipendula and 1.81, 8.82, 114.11, 24.18,
   9.84, 7.05, and 119.46 mu g g(-1) (dry wt.) in S. vulgare, respectively.
   Metal pollution indices were established for each location. Total PAH
   concentrations (I 16 pound PAHs) ranged from 287.4 ng g(-1) in S.
   filipendula (Mayaro) to 605.1 ng g(-1) in S. vulgare (Speyside). The use
   of PAH diagnostic ratios, principal component analysis, and cluster
   analysis were used for source identification of PAHs in each of the
   Sargassum spp. from the various regions. It was concluded that these
   Sargassum spp. can be utilized as biomarkers for heavy metals and PAHs
   in the surrounding waters of Trinidad and Tobago.

AB Small, remote islands, such as low coral atolls, with nutrient-poor,
   biogenic soils for food crops and vulnerability to extreme weather, have
   long been considered marginal environments for human habitation. Yet,
   four decades of archaeological research in the atoll archipelago of the
   Marshall Islands, eastern Micronesia have demonstrated sustained human
   occupation there for over two millennia. Here, we present a fine-grained
   analysis of mollusc remains from four recently excavated archaeological
   sites (4476 total MNI / 14843 total NISP) combined with mapping and
   analysis of extant benthic habitats, on Ebon Atoll, Marshall Islands. We
   examine spatial and temporal variability in mollusc foraging practices
   from prehistoric village sites and ephemeral camp sites across the
   windward-leeward exposure gradient. Our analysis demonstrates that
   foragers targeted a rich assemblage of taxa from different habitats,
   reflecting a foraging strategy that was adapted to local environmental
   conditions. Human foraging over 2000 years documented no observable
   human impacts to molluscs or nearshore intertidal marine ecosystems,
   challenging previous notions of atolls as marginal, exceptionally
   difficult settings for human habitation.
   RESUME Les petites iles reculees, comme les atolls coralliens de faible
   altitude aux sols biogeniques pauvres en elements nutritifs pour les
   cultures alimentaires et exposes a des conditions climatiques extremes,
   ont longtemps ete considerees comme des environnements marginaux pour
   l'habitat humain. Pourtant, quatre decennies de recherches
   archeologiques dans l'archipel d'atolls des iles Marshall a l'est de la
   Micronesie y ont demontre une occupation humaine soutenue pendant plus
   de deux millenaires. Nous presentons ici une analyse nuancee de restes
   de mollusques provenant de quatre sites recents de fouilles
   archeologiques (NMI total 4476 / NISP total 14843) combines a une
   cartographie et une analyse d'habitats benthiques subsistants sur
   l'atoll d'Ebon dans les iles Marshall. Nous examinons la variabilite
   spatiale et temporelle dans les pratiques de recherche de nourriture a
   partir de villages prehistoriques et de sites de campements ephemeres
   sur un ensemble de pentes exposees au vent et sous le vent. Notre
   analyse demontre que les chasseurs-cueilleurs visaient une riche
   association de taxons dans des habitats differents, ceci refletant une
   strategie de recherche de nourriture adaptee aux conditions ecologiques
   locales. La recherche de nourriture par l'homme sur 2000 ans n'atteste
   d'aucun impact de celui-ci observable sur les mollusques ou les
   ecosystemes marins intertidaux proches du rivage. Ceci met en question
   des notions anterieures sur les atolls en tant que milieux marginaux,
   extremement difficiles pour l'habitat humain.

   Caribbean Central Bank (ECCB) Monetary Union as a whole. Net foreign
   assets of Dominica are expected to show the largest decline while those
   for Grenada the least. The impact on the net foreign assets of the
   subregion may be mitigated by other foreign exchange inflows. In
   addition there was little variation in the growth in M1 with the
   exception of Dominica suggesting money-output neutrality. Government
   revenues were not adversely affected suggesting that the terms of trade
   shock may be viewed as being temporary and agents borrow to maintain
   existing tastes and preferences. This result hinged on the nexus between
   government revenue and the reliance on trade taxes on imports suggesting
   some ambiguity in the explanation of the Harberger-Laursen-Meltzer

AB Eidolon helvum is a widespread African fruit bat. It is migratory and
   can form colonies of millions of individuals. On Principe, in the Gulf
   of Guinea, there are seemingly large numbers of E helvum. Here, they
   have lost their migratory behaviour and rely on the availability of the
   year-round food resources on the island, which is small (128 km(2)) but
   is dominated by both primary rainforest and fruit-tree plantations. We
   visited the major roost for E helvum on the island. Exit counts carried
   out on two consecutive nights showed the roost was used by between
   10,539 (SE +/- 67) and 14,160 (SE +/- 324) individuals. Compared to
   mainland Africa, the colony was small, no doubt constrained by the size
   of the island. Nonetheless, Principe still supports a considerable
   density of E helvum of between 82 and 111 bats/km(2), which is
   comparable with densities found on mainland Africa.

AB This paper emerges from an attempt to more actively integrate
   archaeology with ongoing geographical and environmental discussions of
   human responses to the effects of climate change in the Caribbean. If
   archaeology is to contribute to the mitigation strategies currently
   being developed, then robust interpretations are necessary that can be
   practically integrated with inter-disciplinary action. This paper
   discusses the methods needed to provide the high-resolution data and
   interpretations required using archaeological and palaeoenvironmental
   research from a case study area in northern Cuba. Using data collected
   from an ongoing collaborative archaeological research project with the
   Cuban Ministry of Science, Technology and Environment, we evaluate
   whether it is possible to make useful interpretations of human response
   to past changes in sea-level, precipitation and hurricane activity.
   Specifically, the effects of these activities on the changing nature of
   settlement locations, food procurement strategies and household
   architecture among pre-Columbian communities are evaluated. Indigenous
   mitigation strategies are identified and used to inform modern day
   preparation for the impacts of climate change in the Caribbean. (C) 2009

AB Diversity trends 8.3-2.5 Ma in Caribbean deep-sea foraminifera, as
   interpreted from the indices Fisher's a and the Information Index [H(S)]
   parallel paleoproductivity proxies (benthic foraminiferal
   infaunal/epifaunal species ratio, benthic foraminifer accumulation rates
   and flux of organic carbon to the seafloor). Paleoproductivity never
   reached a eutrophic threshold value above which we would predict
   opposite trends of high paleoproductivity and low diversity, consistent
   with stressful conditions. Instead, results are similar to those from
   other studies of oligotrophic settings that show a positive and
   statistically significant correlation between paleoproductivity and
   diversity. The correlations between current intensity and watermass
   oxygenation with diversity are negative and statistically significant.
   These results are also borne out by Principal Component Analysis (PCA).
   Intervals of increased relative abundance of Epistominella exigua, a
   proxy for seasonality of phytodetrital input to the seafloor, coincide
   with increased diversity, suggesting that pulsed paleoproductivity
   enhanced the diversity signal in the Caribbean. Diversity and
   paleoproductivity peaked in the Caribbean at 7.9 Ma, and declined
   thereafter due to the cut off of the nutrient-rich Pacific deep waters
   (< 1000 m) into the Caribbean. From 7.6 to 4.2 Ma, both diversity and
   paleoproductivity increased. With the complete closure of the
   Caribbean-Pacific seaway at 4.2 Ma, both diversity and paleoproductivity
   gradually decreased from a high at 4.2 Ma to moderate values until the
   end of the study interval at 2.5 Ma. Major intervals of significant
   shifts in Caribbean diversity and paleoproductivity were also confirmed
   with SHEBI analysis that displays a diverging trend between the Pacific
   and Caribbean sites since 7.9 Ma, with the Caribbean displaying
   decreasing values. In summary, in the Caribbean, decreased
   paleoproductivity due to the gradual constriction and the final closure
   of the Central American Seaway (CAS) led to decreased deep-sea benthic
   foraminiferal diversity and that both benthic foraminiferal diversity
   and paleoproductivity maintained a positive relationship. Published by

AB Understanding the conservation status of species is important for
   prioritizing the allocation of resources to redress or reduce
   biodiversity loss. Regional organizations that manage threats to the
   marine biodiversity of the Caribbean and Gulf of Mexico seek to
   delineate conservation priorities. This process can be usefully informed
   by extinction risk assessments conducted under the International Union
   for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List criteria: a widely used,
   objective method to communicate species-specific conservation needs.
   Prior to the recent Red List initiatives summarized in this study, the
   conservation status was known for just one-quarter of the 1360 Greater
   Caribbean marine bony shorefishes. During 10 Red List workshops, experts
   applied data on species' distributions, populations, habitats, and
   threats in order to assign an extinction risk category to nearly 1000
   shorefishes that range in the Greater Caribbean. As conservation is
   mostly implemented at national and local levels, two more workshops
   assessed the Gulf of Mexico populations of 940 shorefishes using the
   regional Red List guidelines. About 5% of these shorefishes are globally
   or regionally threatened, including 6% of Greater Caribbean endemics and
   26% of Gulf endemics. About 9% of the species are Data Deficient.
   Species-richness analyses show that the highest numbers of threatened
   species endemic to the Greater Caribbean are found in Belize, Panama,
   and the Cayman Islands. The most pervasive threats to the threatened and
   Near Threatened species are overexploitation, habitat degradation, and
   predation by the invasive lionfish. Half of the threatened species are
   experiencing multiple threats that are likely to amplify extinction
   risk. Recommended actions, in addition to conducting diversity surveys
   in lesser explored areas, include improving fishery management, reducing
   habitat degradation, and controlling lionfish populations.

AB The space-rime variation of phytoplankton pigments in the western
   Intra-Americas Sea (IAS), in the vicinity of the island of Cuba, is
   examined using digital images obtained with the Coastal Zone Color
   Scanner sensor flown aboard the Nimbus 7 satellite from 1978 to 1986.
   The results are compared to historical in situ hydrographic
   observations. A marked seasonality in pigment concentration was observed
   in waters around Cuba, with an average of 0.07 mg m(-3) in summer
   (April-September) and 0.13 mg m-3 during winter (October-March). The
   range of variation in pigment concentration was larger in the Gulf of
   Mexico relative to the western Caribbean Sea. We identified four
   biogeographical areas on the basis of groups of pixels with similar
   patterns of time variability. These are area I: southwest of Cuba,
   Yucatan Channel, and Florida Strait; area II: central Gulf of Mexico;
   area III: east of Cuba; and area IV: central Caribbean Sea, south of
   Jamaica and Hispaniola. Two major meteorological events led to anomalies
   in the seasonal cycle of pigment concentrations. During El Nino-Southern
   Oscillation (ENSO) of 1982-1983, positive anomalies were observed in the
   pigment concentration in the western IAS during winter months. This was
   associated with intense mixing of the water column by higher-frequency
   and stronger winds associated with cold fronts. ENSO 1952-1983 therefore
   had a fertilizing effect on the IAS region. Another positive anomaly was
   observed in 1980-1981, a non-ENSO period that featured higher hurricane
   and extratropical low-pressure activity.

AB Miocene sediments of the Caribbean Gatun and Chagres formations, Panama
   Canal basin, were deposited within an archipelagic strait that connected
   Caribbean and Pacific waters. Shallow-water (similar to 25 m) benthic
   foraminifera of the Gatun Formation have a strong Caribbean affinity,
   indicating that a significant interoceanic, biogeographic barrier had
   formed at similar to 8 Ma. However, benthic foraminifera of the
   overlying Chagres Formation are bathyal and markedly Pacific in
   affinity, indicating that at similar to 6 Ma, waters of the Panama
   isthmian strait deepened to similar to 200-500 m and Pacific bathyal
   waters flowed into the Caribbean. The Chagres Formation crops out at the
   Caribbean entrance to the Panama Canal in a large wedge of
   cross-laminated sandstone and coquina. The cross-laminations and coarse
   grain size indicate high-energy currents atypical of bathyal settings.
   We infer that a jet of the Pacific North Equatorial
   Countercurrent-Equatorial Undercurrent passed through the Panama
   isthmian strait to deposit these sediments on the Caribbean side. This
   later entry of Pacific taxa into the Caribbean had no apparent effect on
   the subsequent composition of Caribbean faunas.

AB We report the first radiometric dates (thermal-ionization mass
   spectrometry) from late Pleistocene reef deposits from offshore Belize,
   the location of the largest modern reef complex in the Atlantic Ocean,
   The results presented here can be used to explain significant
   differences in bathymetry, sedimentary facies, and reef development of
   this major reef area, and the results are significant because they
   contribute to the knowledge of the regional geology of the eastern
   Yucatan. The previously held concept of a neotectonically stable eastern
   Yucatan is challenged. The dates indicate that Pleistocene reefs and
   shallow-water Limestones, which form the basement of modern reefs in the
   area, accumulated ca. 125-130 ka. Significant differences in elevation
   of the samples relative to present sea level (>10 m) have several
   possible causes. Differential subsidence along a series of continental
   margin fault blocks in combination with variation in karstification are
   probably the prime causes, Differential subsidence is presumably related
   to initial extension and later left-lateral movements along the adjacent
   active boundary between the North American and Caribbean plates.
   Increasing dissolution toward the south during Pleistocene sea-level
   lowstands is probably a consequence of higher precipitation rates in
   mountainous southern Belize.

AB Recent surveys of the shark and ray catches of artisanal fishers in the
   Western Province of Papua New Guinea (PNG) resulted in the rediscovery
   of the threatened river sharks, Glyphis garricki and Glyphis glyphis.
   These represent the first records of both species in PNG since the 1960s
   and 1970s and highlight the lack of studies of shark biodiversity in
   PNG. Two individuals of G. garricki and three individuals of G. glyphis
   were recorded from coastal marine waters of the Daru region of PNG in
   October and November 2014. The two G. garricki specimens were small
   individuals estimated to be 100-105 cm and similar to 113 cm total
   length (TL). The three G. glyphis specimens were all mature, one a
   pregnant female and two adult males. These are the first adults of G.
   glyphis recorded to date providing a more accurate maximum size for this
   species, i.e. similar to 260 cm TL. A single pup which was released from
   the pregnant female G. glyphis, was estimated to be similar to 65 cm TL.
   Anecdotal information from the fishers of pregnant females of G. glyphis
   containing 6 or 7 pups provides the first estimate of litter size for
   this species. The jaws of the pregnant female G. glyphis were retained
   and a detailed description of the dentition is provided, since adult
   dentition has not been previously documented for this species. Genetic
   analyses confirmed the two species cluster well within samples from
   these species collected in northern Australia.

AB [1] We investigate aragonitic skeletons of the Caribbean sclerosponge
   Ceratoporella nicholsoni from Jamaica, 20 m below sea level (mbsl), and
   Pedro Bank, 125 mbsl. We use delta(18)O and Sr/Ca ratios as temperature
   proxies to reconstruct the Caribbean mixed layer and thermocline
   temperature history since 1400 A. D. with a decadal time resolution. Our
   age models are based on U/Th dating and locating of the radiocarbon bomb
   spike. The modern temperature difference between the two sites is used
   to tentatively calibrate the C. nicholsoni Sr/Ca thermometer. The
   resulting calibration points to a temperature sensitivity of Sr/Ca in C.
   nicholsoni aragonite of about - 0.1 mmol/mol/ K. Our Sr/Ca records
   reveal a pronounced warming from the early 19th to the late 20th
   century, both at 20 and 125 mbsl. Two temperature minima in the shallow
   water record during the late 17th and early 19th century correspond to
   the Maunder and Dalton sunspot minima, respectively. Another major
   cooling occurred in the late 16th century and is not correlatable with a
   sunspot minimum. The temperature contrast between the two sites
   decreased from the 14th century to a minimum in the late 17th century
   and subsequently increased to modern values in the early 19th century.
   This is interpreted as a long-term deepening and subsequent shoaling of
   the Caribbean thermocline. The major trends of the Sr/Ca records are
   reproduced in both specimens but hardly reflected in the delta(18)O
   records.

AB Small island states or dependencies have increasingly turned to
   international mass tourism as a strategy for overcoming their
   underdeveloped status. However, mounting criticism of this sector has
   increased the interest in alternative tourism. The Caribbean island of
   Montserrat is well positioned to implement an ecotourism strategy based
   on the island's scenic beauty, biodiversity and historical/cultural
   attributes. This would augment an already unconventional tourism product
   emphasizing low-density residential tourism. The fact that few tangible
   initiatives have so far been taken in the direction of ecotourism is not
   problematic, since careful planning is advisable given the risks
   inherent in any form of tourism, and given existing and potential
   problems which could threaten its viability. A Montserrat Heritage Trail
   network is proposed as the centrepiece of this ecotourism product, while
   various marketing and institutional initiatives are recommended.

AB The first-order loss rate constant of methyl bromide was measured in
   surface seawater samples from the North Atlantic Ocean, Caribbean Sea,
   and coastal eastern Pacific Ocean during May-July 1998, A stable isotope
   incubation technique was used, which consisted of spiking seawater
   samples with (CH3Br)-C-13 and following the loss rate of the
   isotopically labeled spike with gas chromatography and isotope dilution
   mass spectrometry. The analysis of both filtered and unfiltered aliquots
   of seawater provides insight into the relative importance of chemical
   and particle-related (presumably biological) degradation pathways. Over
   the entire cruise, first-order total degradation rate constants ranged
   from 0.03-0.40 day(-1). On average, higher rate constants were observed
   during the last part of the cruise in the Caribbean Sea (mean 0.34
   day-l) and coastal Pacific waters (0.31 day(-1)), than in the earlier
   passage through the North Atlantic Ocean (0.18 day(-1), legs 1 and 3).
   In the warm waters of the Caribbean Sea and the Pacific, total
   degradation rate constants were controlled primarily by chemical losses
   (0.30 and 0.25 day(-1), respectively). In the colder Atlantic waters the
   average chemical loss rate constant was lower (0.11 day(-1)), and
   biological losses constituted a significant fraction of the total loss
   rate constant (35%). Chemical loss rate constants varied strongly with
   water temperature, in good agreement with previous determinations of the
   rate constant for methyl bromide removal from seawater due to chloride
   substitution and hydrolysis. Biological losses were detected in most of
   the water samples analyzed, suggesting that the biological capability to
   degrade methyl bromide is ubiquitous in the oceans. Rate constants for
   biological removal exhibited no apparent relationship to seawater
   temperature, salinity, chlorophyll, or bacterial counts.

AB Littorals in the in the Exuma Cays, Bahamas and the Bath Plantation,
   Barbados are comparative in many ways. These edges of the sea have
   provided critical services to local people during the time of slavery
   and since. More than food and medicine, the littoral is the nightly sea
   bath, where children are instructed, and the last ecosystem effectively
   used by the elderly. Independence and self-respect derive from use and
   protection of these littoral by individuals and communities. Local
   patterns of conservation and use are argued to be essential in the
   ecological structure and functions of the littoral. Development projects
   and marine protected areas alike are seen as potentially breaking local
   ties with the littoral causing trophic skew and damaging local society.
   If development occurs, mitigation solutions potentially derive from
   legally recognizing local people as partners in the co-management of
   their traditional littoral.

AB Recent phylogeographic studies have overturned three paradigms for the
   origins of marine biodiversity. (i) Physical (allopatric) isolation is
   not the sole avenue for marine speciation: many species diverge along
   ecological boundaries. (ii) Peripheral habitats such as oceanic
   archipelagos are not evolutionary graveyards: these regions can export
   biodiversity. (iii) Speciation in marine and terrestrial ecosystems
   follow similar processes but are not the same: opportunities for
   allopatric isolation are fewer in the oceans, leaving greater
   opportunity for speciation along ecological boundaries. Biodiversity
   hotspots such as the Caribbean Sea and the Indo-Pacific Coral Triangle
   produce and export species, but can also accumulate biodiversity
   produced in peripheral habitats. Both hotspots and peripheral ecosystems
   benefit from this exchange in a process dubbed biodiversity feedback.

AB Despite its relative isolation from the world stage and lack of
   resources, the Marshall Islands serve as an example of the interaction
   between global political power, macroeconomic forces and local cultural
   factors. At the national level, patterns of food importation and
   government programs encourage the consumption of high fat foods. These
   factors have fostered dependency on Western foods and a loss of
   traditional food practices. Beliefs come into play as microlevel factors
   that influence food choice and aspects of lifestyle. Nearly three
   quarters of women are overweight or obese in this setting. Obesity in
   women is associated with greater age, higher education and more imported
   food consumption. Over a third of children ages 1-5 y are stunted, with
   stunting associated with worse economic status, less active feeding,
   increased consumption of imported foods and urban residence. What can be

AB The urophoriner (tail-pouch) pipefish genus Micrognathus Duncker is
   reviewed and 4 Indo-Pacific and 1 Atlantic species are recognized. Other
   nominal species usually included in Micrognathus are provisionally
   referred to the genus Halicampus Kaup. M. natans sp. nov., characterized
   in part by a modal count of 14 trunk rings, is described from the
   Philippines, eastern Australia, New Caledonia and the Fiji Islands.
   Other Indo-Pacific species include the type-species, M. brevirostris
   (Ruppell, sensu Kaup, 1856), M. andersonii (Bleeker) and M.
   micronotopterus (Fowler). M. andersonii and M. micronotopterus typically
   lack protruding, hook-like posterior angles on the tail rings; rings on
   the distal half or more of the tail have prominent hook-like spines or
   points in M. brevirostris. M. andersonii (modally 16 trunk rings) ranges
   from the northern Red Sea to Japan (Honshu Island), Samoa and Tonga; M.
   micronotopterus (modally 15 trunk rings) is known from northern and
   western Australia, western Indonesia, Singapore and the Philippines. M.
   brevirostris includes 2 sspp., M. b. brevirostris in the Red Sea and M.
   b. pygmaeus in northeastern Australia, eastern Indonesia, Marshall
   Islands (Bikini) and Tahiti. These subspecies share a modal count of 15
   trunk rings, but differ in preserve coloration, as well as in numbers of
   pectoral-fin rays and subdorsal tail rings (respectively, 9-11 and
   3.75-4.75 vs. 10-13 and 2.75-4.0 in M. b. pygmaeus). There are no
   confirmed Indian Ocean records of any species of Micrognathus between
   Madagascar, the southwest tip of India and the northwest coast of
   Australia. The single Atlantic species (M. erugatus), characterized by
   20 trunk rings, is known only from the Brazilian type locality. A key is
   provided, each taxon is diagnosed and illustrated, and maps delineate
   distributions to Indo-Pacific species as determined for materials
   examined.

AB The Pacific Solution' of transporting asylum seekers who arrive by boat
   in Australian waters to detention centres on Nauru and on Manus Island
   in Papua New Guinea (PNG) has attracted considerable international
   attention. Most of this has focused on the treatment of those detained
   and the morality, practicality and sustainability of Australian refugee
   policy. In this issue of Pacific Currents', we focus on the consequences
   for the Island nations. This article sets the scene for articles on
   Nauru and Manus Island by: 1. outlining the policy debates that led to
   the two phases of the Pacific Solution'; 2. assembling data covering the
   numbers and costs involved; and 3. exploring the policy options in the
   wake of the PNG Supreme Court's April 2016 ruling that the Manus Island
   centre was in violation of the constitution. All three papers are
   particularly concerned to explore the domestic political and legal
   ramifications of the centres for Nauru and PNG, and to examine the
   impact on Australia's reputation in the Pacific region.

AB Efforts to incentivize the reduction of carbon emissions from
   deforestation and forest degradation require accurate carbon accounting.
   The extensive tropical forest of Papua New Guinea (PNG) is a target for
   such efforts and yet local carbon estimates are few. Previous estimates,
   based on models of neotropical vegetation applied to PNG forest plots,
   did not consider such factors as the unique species composition of New
   Guinea vegetation, local variation in forest biomass, or the
   contribution of small trees. We analysed all trees >1cm in diameter at
   breast height (DBH) in Melanesia's largest forest plot (Wanang) to
   assess local spatial variation and the role of small trees in carbon
   storage. Above-ground living biomass (AGLB) of trees averaged 210.72
   Mgha(-1) at Wanang. Carbon storage at Wanang was somewhat lower than in
   other lowland tropical forests, whereas local variation among 1-ha
   subplots and the contribution of small trees to total AGLB were
   substantially higher. We speculate that these differences may be
   attributed to the dynamics of Wanang forest where erosion of a recently
   uplifted and unstable terrain appears to be a major source of natural
   disturbance. These findings emphasize the need for locally calibrated
   forest carbon estimates if accurate landscape level valuation and
   monetization of carbon is to be achieved. Such estimates aim to situate
   PNG forests in the global carbon context and provide baseline
   information needed to improve the accuracy of PNG carbon monitoring
   schemes.

AB Inhabitants of Lihir Island, Papua New Guinea, have traditionally relied
   on reef fishing and rotational farming of slash-burn forest plots for a
   subsistence diet. However, a new gold mine has introduced a cash economy
   to the island's socioeconomic system and impacted the fringing coral
   reef through sedimentation from the near-shore dumping of mine wastes.
   Studies of the Lihirian people have documented changes in population
   size, local customs, health, education, and land use; studies of the
   reef have documented impacts to fish populations in mine affected sites.
   Indirect effects from these impacts are complex and indecipherable when
   viewed only from isolated studies. Here, we use qualitative modelling to
   synthesize the social and biological research programs in order to
   understand the interaction of the human and ecological systems. Initial
   modelling results appear to be consistent with differences in fish and
   macroalgae populations in sites with and without coral degradation due
   to sedimentation. A greater cash flow from mine expansion is predicted
   to increase the human population, the intensity of the artisanal
   fishery, and the rate of sewage production and land clearing. Modelling
   results are being used to guide ongoing research projects, such as
   monitoring fish populations and artisanal catch and patterns and
   intensity of land clearing.

AB Background: Regional genetic connectivity models are critical for
   successful conservation and management of marine species. Even though
   rocky shore invertebrates have been used as model systems to understand
   genetic structure in some marine environments, our understanding of
   connectivity in Caribbean communities is based overwhelmingly on studies
   of tropical fishes and corals. In this study, we investigate population
   connectivity and diversity of Cittarium pica, an abundant rocky shore
   trochid gastropod that is commercially harvested across its natural
   range, from the Bahamas to Venezuela.
   Methodology/Principal Findings: We tested for genetic structure using
   DNA sequence variation at the mitochondrial COI and 16S loci, AMOVA and
   distance-based methods. We found substantial differentiation among
   Caribbean sites. Yet, genetic differentiation was associated only with
   larger geographic scales within the Caribbean, and the pattern of
   differentiation only partially matched previous assessments of Caribbean
   connectivity, including those based on larval dispersal from
   hydrodynamic models. For instance, the Bahamas, considered an
   independent region by previous hydrodynamic studies, showed strong
   association with Eastern Caribbean sites in our study. Further, Bonaire
   (located in the east and close to the meridional division of the
   Caribbean basin) seems to be isolated from other Eastern sites.
   Conclusions/Significance: The significant genetic structure and observed
   in C. pica has some commonalities in pattern with more commonly sampled
   taxa, but presents features, such as the differentiation of Bonaire,
   that appear unique. Further, the level of differentiation, together with
   regional patterns of diversity, has important implications for the
   application of conservation and management strategies in this
   commercially harvested species.

AB In this study, we demonstrate how perturbations to the Florida Current
   caused by hurricanes are relevant to the spread of invasive lionfish
   from Florida to the Bahamas. Without such perturbations, this current
   represents a potential barrier to the transport of planktonic lionfish
   eggs and larvae across the Straits of Florida. We further show that once
   lionfish became established in the Bahamas, hurricanes significantly
   hastened their spread through the island chain. We gain these insights
   through: (1) an analysis of the direction and velocity of simulated
   ocean currents during the passage of hurricanes through the Florida
   Straits and (2) the development of a biophysical model that incorporates
   the tolerances of lionfish to ocean climate, their reproductive
   strategy, and duration that the larvae remain viable in the water
   column. On the basis of this work, we identify 23 occasions between the
   years 1992 and 2006 in which lionfish were provided the opportunity to
   breach the Florida Current. We also find that hurricanes during this
   period increased the rate of spread of lionfish through the Bahamas by
   more than 45% and magnified its population by at least 15%. Beyond
   invasive lionfish, we suggest that extreme weather events such as
   hurricanes likely help to homogenize the gene pool for all Caribbean
   marine species susceptible to transport.

AB Distribution patterns and genetic diversity of Caloglossa species have
   been studied in various regions but are still poorly understood around
   the tropical western Pacific where many marine organisms show high
   species richness. We explored the diversity of Caloglossa species in New
   Ireland, Papua New Guinea using morphological and genetic analyses.
   Seven species of Caloglossa (C. adhaerens, C. leprieurii, C.
   ogasawaraensis, C. bengalensis, C. postiae, C. saigonensis and C.
   vieillardii) were collected from eight sites; the latter four species
   are new records in Papua New Guinea. All specimens collected were
   cultured to compare their morphology under the same culture condition.
   Reproductive structures of gametophytes and/or sporophytes were
   described for the first time in some species from these collections. In
   C. leprieurii, gall-like structure appeared in most gametophyte strains
   but not in tetrasporophytes. Such galls were produced from wing cells,
   and spermatangia and/or procarps were formed on many galls. The LSU rDNA
   and rbcL analyses revealed high intraspecific diversity in many species
   although the number of samples was limited and the sampling sites were
   within 200 km. We revealed high species richness and intraspecific
   genetic variation in Papua New Guinea, suggesting a hot spot for the
   diversity of Caloglossa.

AB Palm oil production provides economic benefits in developing countries
   but its development can drastically alter landscapes. We investigated an
   oil palm-dominated landscape in New Britain, Papua New Guinea, and
   developed a simple remote sensing approach, supported by site visits and
   video surveys, to assess the condition and the extent of recent change
   in riparian zones. Riparian buffer zones were extensively modified.
   Riparian disturbance occurred in both corporate plantations and
   smallholder blocks. Older areas of oil palm were planted before riparian
   buffer zone protocols were established, but there has been continuing
   recent loss and disturbance of natural riparian vegetation, despite
   increasing awareness of the importance of riparian buffer zones.
   Explanations for this are complex. For smallholders, a rapidly growing
   population is increasing the need for income-generating oil palm
   planting and household gardens, leading to utilisation of riparian zones
   for oil palm, gardens or villages. Improved management of riparian
   zones, combined with effective monitoring, is essential to maintain or
   improve ecological functioning and biodiversity of aquatic ecosystems
   and the associated benefits for local communities. In conclusion, the
   simple remote sensing approach developed here, supported by ground
   truthing and video surveys, provides a robust and effective means of
   assessing riparian condition in a complex and changing landscape. The
   techniques could be used to assess the effectiveness of future
   initiatives to improve aquatic ecosystem condition in similar
   agriculture-dominated regions.

AB Recent empirical studies have demonstrated that human activities such as
   fishing can strongly affect the natural capital and services provided by
   tropical seascapes. However, policies to mitigate anthropogenic impacts
   can also alter food web structure and interactions, regardless of
   whether the regulations are aimed at single or multiple species, with
   possible unexpected consequences for the ecosystems and their associated
   services. Complex community response to management interventions have
   been highlighted in the Caribbean, where, contrary to predictions from
   linear food chain models, a reduction in fishing intensity through the
   establishment of a marine reserve has led to greater biomass of
   herbivorous fish inside the reserve, despite an increased abundance of
   large predatory piscivores. This positive multi-trophic response, where
   both predators and prey benefit from protection, highlights the need to
   take an integrated approach that considers how numerous factors control
   species coexistence in both fished and unfished systems. In order to
   understand these complex relationships, we developed a general model to
   examine the trade-offs between fishing pressure and trophic control on
   reef fish communities, including an exploration of top-down and
   bottom-up effects. We then validated the general model predictions by
   parameterizing the model for a reef system in the Bahamas in order to
   tease apart the wide range of species responses to reserves in the
   Caribbean. Combining the development of general theory and site-specific
   models parameterized with field data reveals the underlying driving
   forces in these communities and enables us to make better predictions
   about possible population and community responses to different
   management schemes.

AB Qualitative and quantitative collecting was undertaken in 1987 to
   determine the species composition, abundance, and distribution of
   hydroids in a mangrove system at Twin Cays, Belize. Of 49 species
   identified, the 5 most frequent were Ventromma halecioides, Nemalecium
   sp., Clytia hemisphaerica, Dynamena crisioides and Halopteris diaphana.
   Line-transect census data and qualitative observations showed that the
   hydroid fauna was sparse in sheltered, still-water areas of the mangal,
   but relatively abundant and diverse in areas exposed to waves and/or
   tidal currents. Species composition and relative abundance varied with
   depth at stations in exposed locations and in tidal creeks and channels.
   Although Turritopsoides brehmeri is known only from Twin Cays at
   present, it seems improbable that any of the species is restricted to
   mangrove ecosystems.

AB Understanding past climate may contribute to a better understanding of
   future climate change, allowing for adaptations to changing water
   resources. High latitude paleoclimate reconstructions reveal a warmer
   northern hemisphere during the mid-Holocene, yet paleoclimate records
   from tropical Central America are lacking, especially seasonally
   resolved reconstructions needed to resolve seasonal shifts. Here we
   reconstruct mid-Holocene precipitation using high-resolution (sub-annual
   to biannual) stable isotope ratios (oxygen and carbon) extracted from a
   speleothem recovered from Belize to investigate the frequency and
   magnitude of precipitation variability. We found a slight increase in
   precipitation during the mid-Holocene in Belize with less variability
   compared to the late-Holocene. This increase in precipitation may be a
   result of the expansion of the North Atlantic Subtropical High (NASH),
   which strengthens the Caribbean Lower Level Jet, enhancing westward
   advection of atmospheric moisture to Belize. The decrease in
   precipitation variability could be derived from a northward movement of
   the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) placing Belize within the
   bounds of the ITCZ for a longer period each year. Time series analysis
   reveals periodicities of 200-250 years which correspond to the Suess
   solar cycle. The additional periods of similar to 100 and similar to 50
   years also have origins in solar irradiance. The North Atlantic
   Oscillation (NAO) and the Atlantic Multidecadal Variability (AMV; also
   known as the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation (AMO)), long recognized
   as important drivers of precipitation variability in the region, are
   present but only at the 90% significance level. We posit that the
   reduced influence of the NAO and AMV could be caused by the northerly
   migration of the ITCZ during the mid-Holocene. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

AB The armoured catfish Hoplosternum liitorale (Hancock) is commercially
   cultured in Trinidad and Tobago, Guyana and Suriname. In some culture
   systems, fingerlings are collected from the wild, but more commonly the
   fingerlings are hatchery produced. Hatching success is a key problem. In
   initial hatching trials with low hatching success, the culture water was
   found to contain high populations of the bacterium Aeromonas hydrophila
   and the fungus Saprolegnia sp. In subsequent trials, the egg masses were
   treated with antibiotics and anti-fungal agents. While the anti-fungal
   treatment of intact egg masses had Little apparent effect on hatching
   success, the antibiotic treatment resulted in an increase from 52.2% to
   60.5%. When egg masses were broken into smaller pieces and treated with
   antibiotics and anti-fungal agents, hatching success increased from
   50.0% to 81.8%. This suggests that treatment of the egg masses with
   antibiotics and anti-fungal agents is more effective with smaller egg
   masses. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

   from shallow sublittoral coralline sand sampled between Lee Stocking
   Island and Norman's Pond Cay (Exuma Cays), Bahamas. Cephalodasys
   interinsularis n. sp. reaches a body length of 471 mu m and is
   characterized by a new combination of characters including six total
   anterior adhesive tubes and five pairs of ventrolateral adhesive tubes.
   The new species is morphologically similar to C. swedmarki but can be
   distinguished by the different number of anterior adhesive tubes, the
   spatial arrangement of the ventrolateral adhesive tubes, and a shorter
   pharynx. We provide an updated diagnosis of the genus and a
   determination key to all known species of Cephalodasys. C.
   interinsularis n. sp. is the third known species of Cephalodasys from
   the Caribbean marine province.

AB An African Network of Food Data System (AFROFOODS) as part of the
   International Network of Food Data Systems (INFOODS) was established in
   September 1994 in Ghana. This was followed by a meeting in Dakar (Ghana)
   during May 1995 during which activities were reestablished. Capacity
   building and training in analytical methods and compilation of food
   composition data were identified as a pre-requisite for progress during
   both the meetings. During a workshop in May 1996 a module on Food
   Composition and Hygiene for an MSc in Food and Nutrition Sciences in
   developing countries for the Network of European Agricultural
   Universities (NATURA)-NECTAR group as part of an EU-financed program was
   drawn up. The module was based on the existing Food Composition Course
   of Wageningen Agricultural University and was first tested in South
   Africa during 1997 at the University of the Western Cape. The 2nd
   ECSAFOODS course was held in 1999 at the Agricultural Research Council
   (ARC) in Pretoria, South Africa, with a third course planned for 2002.
   During an AFROFOODS meeting that was held in Pretoria, South Africa, six
   working groups were elected (June 2001), namely for: training,
   analytical procedures, communication and dissemination, use of food
   composition databases, food legislation, standards and regulations and
   data compilation. AFROFOODS seem to lag behind other data centers with
   regard to the progress they have made during the same time period.
   Capacity building in the AFROFOODS region stays one of the major
   priorities for the immediate future, to equip people to assist their own
   countries in reaching the ultimate goal of being able to compile
   good-quality food composition tables that reflect the individual food
   components in the diet of the different people within the country.

AB There is increasing concern globally, regarding the consumption of foods
   contaminated with heavy metals such as cadmium (Cd), with consequent
   implementation of stringent food safety standards for consumer
   protection. Cd contents of cocoa beans can affect whether shipments of
   beans can be sold and whether cocoa products manufactured from beans
   with Cd can meet food safety standards. Cd determinations in bean
   exports are usually carried out on whole beans, which are comprised of
   nibs and the covering testae/shells, the latter being impossible to
   completely remove from the nibs used in chocolate and cocoa powder
   manufacture. The aim of this study was to evaluate the distribution of
   Cd levels between the nibs and shells of cocoa beans. This can allow for
   assessment of possible implications of the analytical protocols used for
   Cd determination in cocoa beans and the possible consequences for the
   safety of cocoa products made from such beans. Fermented and dried cocoa
   bean samples from different cacao-growing areas in Trinidad and Tobago
   were separated into nibs and shells and analysed for Cd by flame atomic
   absorption spectrometry, following exhaustive acid digestion. Shells of
   fermented and dried beans were found to contain significantly higher
   (P<0.05) and on average between 1 to 3 times as much Cd than the cocoa
   nibs. Analysis of whole cocoa beans, as well as incorporating shells in
   chocolates can thus result in Cd levels being significantly higher than
   using nibs only. These finding imply that the analysis of whole beans
   currently employed to determine their Cd contents, can affect the
   marketability and prices of cocoa beans. Questions also arise on whether
   the allowed incorporation of shells in the manufacture of cocoa products
   can affect their safety for human consumption.

   quality guidelines for PCBs and DDTs. Relatively higher Sigma DDT
   concentrations and high DDT/DDE + DDD ratios in two sites near the
   outfalls of the city indicated a current DDT usage, probably linked to
   public health emergencies. These results contribute to the sparse

   single large tear-shaped accessory light organ positioned below the
   anterior margin of the eye. In contrast to the many recent
   investigations into the biochemical basis of the red-shifted
   bioluminescence produced by the accessory light organ, Malacosteus has
   received little taxonomic scrutiny in the last 75 years. Four nominal
   species of Malacosteus have been described: M. niger, M. indicus, M.
   choristodactylus, and M. danae. Two species are considered valid: M.
   niger and a new species known from 182 specimens captured in temperate
   and sub-Antarctic waters of the southern hemisphere, the tropical Indian
   Ocean, and waters of the Indo-Australian Archipelago. Diagnosed
   primarily on the basis of postorbital photophore size and serial
   photophore counts, the new species differs further from its only known
   congener in having relatively small jaws and fleshy orbit.

AB Although ecological assemblages frequently depart from neutral model
   predictions, these discrepancies have not been unambiguously attributed
   to neutral theory's core assumption: that community structure is
   primarily the result of chance variation in birth, death, speciation,
   and dispersal, rather than the manifestation of demographic differences
   among species. Using coral communities in Barbados from four time
   periods during the Pleistocene, we demonstrate that the neutral theory
   cannot explain coral community similarity distributions, species'
   regional abundance distributions, or their local occupancy. Furthermore,
   discrepancies between the neutral theory and the observed communities
   can be attributed to violation of the core assumption of species
   equivalence. In particular, species' variable growth rates are driving
   departures from neutral predictions. Our results reinforce an
   understanding of reef coral community assembly that invokes trade-offs
   in species' demographic strategies. The results further suggest that
   conservation management actions will fail if they are based on the
   neutral assumption that different coral species are equally able to
   create live coral cover in the shallow-water reef environment. These
   findings highlight the importance of developing biodiversity theory that
   can parsimoniously incorporate species differences in coral reef
   communities, rather than further elaborating neutral theory.

   are 18 phyllodinous taxa that occur naturally outside Australia, north
   from New Guinea to Indonesia, Taiwan, the Philippines, south-western
   Pacific (New Caledonia to Samoa), northern Pacific (Hawaii) and Indian
   Ocean (Mascarene Islands). Our aim was to determine the phylogenetic
   position of these species within Acacia, to infer their biogeographic
   history. To an existing molecular dataset of 109 taxa of Acacia, we
   added 51 new accessions sequenced for the ITS and ETS regions of nuclear
   rDNA, including samples from 15 extra-Australian taxa. Data were
   analysed using both maximum parsimony and Bayesian methods. The
   phylogenetic positions of the extra-Australian taxa sampled revealed
   four geographic connections. Connection A, i.e. northern
   Australia-South-east Asia-south-western Pacific, is shown by an early
   diverging clade in section Plurinerves, which relates A. confusa from
   Taiwan and the Philippines (possibly Fiji) to A. simplex from Fiji and
   Samoa. That clade is related to A. simsii from southern New Guinea and
   northern Australia and other northern Australian species. Two related
   clades in section Juliflorae show a repeated connection (B), i.e.
   northern Australia-southern New Guinea-south-western Pacific. One of
   these is the 'A. auriculiformis clade', which includes A. spirorbis
   subsp. spirorbis from New Caledonia and the Loyalty Islands as sister to
   the Queensland species A. auriculiformis; related taxa include A.
   mangium, A. leptocarpa and A. spirorbis subsp. solandri. The 'A.
   aulacocarpa clade' includes A. aulacocarpa, A. peregrinalis endemic to
   New Guinea, A. crassicarpa from New Guinea and Australia, and other
   Australian species. Acacia spirorbis (syn. A. solandri subsp. kajewskii)
   from Vanuatu (Melanesia) is related to these two clades but its exact
   position is equivocal. The third biogeographic connection (C) is
   Australia-Timor-Flores, represented independently by the widespread
   taxon A. oraria (section Plurinerves) found on Flores and Timor and in
   north-eastern Queensland, and the Wetar island endemic A. wetarensis
   (Juliflorae). The fourth biogeographic connection (D), i.e.
   Hawaii-Mascarene-eastern Australia, reveals an extreme disjunct
   distribution, consisting of the Hawaiian koa (A. koa, A. koaia and A.
   kaoaiensis), sister to the Mascarene (Reunion Island) species A.
   heterophylla; this clade is sister to the eastern Australian A.
   melanoxylon and A. implexa (all section Plurinerves), and sequence
   divergence between taxa is very low. Historical range expansion of
   acacias is inferred to have occurred several times from an
   Australian-southern New Guinean source. Dispersal would have been
   possible as the Australian land mass approached South-east Asia, and
   during times when sea levels were low, from the Late Miocene or Early
   Pliocene. The close genetic relationship of species separated by vast
   distances, from the Indian Ocean to the Pacific, is best explained by
   dispersal by Austronesians, early Homo sapiens migrants from Asia.

AB Industrial fishing for tuna is a major revenue earner in the Pacific
   Islands region. Capturing more benefits from this fishery is a key
   priority of Pacific Island country governments and people. Many Pacific
   countries have done this by allowing transhipping the transfer of fish
   from industrial purse-seine fishing vessels to carrier vessels in port.
   This paper investigates one such port, Funafuti in Tuvalu. Using a
   unique dataset, the analysis (for the first time) demonstrates that
   there are a number of negative impacts on small-scale fishers associated
   with allowing transhipping in port. These negative impacts include lost
   employment days, reduced catches and, potentially, fresh fish
   availability and lower incomes within the artisanal fishery. The
   analysis also demonstrates that there are benefits associated with
   transhipping, such as spending in local businesses and bycatch
   off-loads. This paper provides a number of considerations for
   governments to optimise the benefits from transhipping and minimise
   costs.

AB Much research has focused on identifying species that are susceptible to
   extinction following ecosystem fragmentation, yet even those species
   that persist in fragmented habitats may have fundamentally different
   ecological roles than conspecifics in unimpacted areas. Shifts in
   trophic role induced by fragmentation, especially of abundant top
   predators, could have transcendent impacts on food web architecture and
   stability, as well as ecosystem function. Here we use a novel measure of
   trophic niche width, based on stable isotope ratios, to assess effects
   of aquatic ecosystem fragmentation on trophic ecology of a resilient,
   dominant, top predator. We demonstrate collapse in trophic niche width
   of the predator in fragmented systems, a phenomenon related to
   significant reductions in diversity of potential prey taxa. Collapsed
   niche width reflects a homogenization of energy flow pathways to top
   predators, likely serving to destabilize remnant food webs and render
   apparently resilient top predators more susceptible to extinction
   through time.

AB Trinidad and Tobago is considered a small island republic with
   continentally sized industries such as petroleum refining, methanol and
   natural gas processing. As a result of the increasing demand for
   petrochemical products on the worldwide market, the augmented
   through-put per plant is generating escalating volumes of waste.
   Although there has been some progress on the definition for hazardous
   waste generated from local industries, with the development of draft
   hazardous Waste Management Rules, many issues of concern exist in this
   interim period. While the country is aimed at supporting other local
   health, safety and environmental legislation, the management of
   Hazardous Waste has become an inconvenient oversight in the successful
   attempts at compliance.
   At present, there are no major deterrents on pollution prevention with
   these cost intensive waste streams and environmental degradation has
   been growing exponentially. This paper examines the environmental
   feasibility of hazardous waste treatment and disposal for the largest
   energy company in the Caribbean an oil refinery, given the throughput,
   demand for products, amount and type of waste generated, legislative
   framework and local environment for disposal.

AB In Papua New Guinea, a significant portion of morbidity and mortality is
   attributed to water-borne diseases. To reduce incidence of disease,
   communities and non-governmental organizations have installed rain
   catchments to provide drinking water of improved quality. However,
   little work has been done to determine whether these rain catchments
   provide drinking water of better quality than traditional drinking water
   sources, and if morbidity is decreased in villages with rain catchments.
   The specific aim of this study was to evaluate the quality of water
   produced by rain catchments in comparison with traditional drinking
   water sources in rural villages in the East Sepik Province. Fifty-four
   water sources in 22 villages were evaluated for enterococci and
   Escherichia coli densities as well as 14 health-relevant metals. In
   addition, we examined how the prevalence of diarrhoeal illness in
   villages relates to the type of primary drinking water source. The
   majority of tested metals were below World Health Organization safety
   limits. Catchment water sources had lower enterococci and E. coli than
   other water sources. Individuals in villages using Sepik River water as
   their primary water source had significantly higher incidence of
   diarrhoea than those primarily using other water sources (streams, dug
   wells and catchments).

AB The lack of dense, high quality, long-term in-situ wind data sets and
   wind resource maps for the Caribbean region is a major impediment to the
   development of wind energy projects. Thus, there is limited
   understanding of the large-scale near-surface wind climate and the
   regional wind resources. Through statistical analyses on 10 m level
   NCEP/DOE reanalysis wind data for the period 1979-2010, this work found
   that although the prevailing winds are from the east-north-east over the
   eastern Caribbean islands, their wind direction distribution are
   bimodal. The regional area-averaged Wind speed attains a maximum in
   January and a secondary maximum in July which coincides with the
   Caribbean Mid-Summer Drought. The derived regional annual wind resource
   map shows that the Caribbean low-level jet (CLLJ) region is an area of
   superb wind power density (WPD), 400-600 W/m(2), the eastern Caribbean
   and the Netherland Antilles are locations of excellent resource, 300-400
   W/m(2), and the Greater Antilles and the Bahamas are areas of good-very
   good resource, 200-300 W/m(2). In general, WPDs are greater in the dry
   season than the wet season. The regional mean annual area-averaged WPD
   is 308 W/m(2) with mean WPDs of 350 W/m(2) for the dry season, 290
   W/m(2) for the early rainy season, and 247 W/m(2) for the late rainy
   season. Annual WPDs vary within +/- 18% of their mean. The area-averaged
   WPD ranges from 124 to 592 W/m(2) (+/- 92% of mean annual WPD) depending
   on the year, season, or month. Therefore, the reanalysis data are shown
   to be suitable for general assessments of the wind resources in the
   Caribbean and thus, may be used as initial and boundary conditions in
   numerical models for the development of high resolution wind maps
   through dynamical downscaling. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

AB Settlement tiles were used to characterise and quantify coral reef
   associated algal communities along water quality and herbivory gradients
   from terrestrial influenced near shore sites to oceanic passage sites in
   Marovo Lagoon, the Solomon Islands. After 6 months, settlement tile
   communities from inshore reefs were dominated by high biomass algal
   turfs (filamentous algae and cyanobacteria) whereas tiles located on
   offshore reefs were characterised by a mixed low biomass community of
   calcareous crustose algae, fleshy crustose algae and bare tile. The
   exclusion of macrograzers, via caging of tiles, on the outer reef sites
   resulted in the development of an algal turf community similar to that
   observed on inshore reefs. Caging on the inshore reef tiles had a
   limited impact on community composition or biomass. Water quality and
   herbivorous fish biomass were quantified at each site to elucidate
   factors that might influence algal community structure across the
   lagoon. Herbivore biomass was the dominant driver of algal community
   structure. Algal biomass on the other hand was controlled by both
   herbivory and water quality (particularly dissolved nutrients). This
   study demonstrates that algal communities on settlement tiles are an
   indicator capable of integrating the impacts of water quality and
   herbivory over a small spatial scale (kilometres) and short temporal
   scale (months), where other environmental drivers (current, light,
   regional variability) are constant.

AB Field studies of the sea cucumber Holothuria conducted in Kogu Veke,
   Solomon Islands, showed monthly recruitment of newly-settled juveniles
   on seagrass and indicated that size distribution was a function of
   substratum type and depth. Adults >250 mm body length were found mainly
   on sand, with <5% organic matter (OM), at depths of >1-3 m. Individuals
   >10-250 mm were found mostly in 30-120 cm of water, on mud and muddy
   sand with OM content between 5 and 10%. Specimens >40-150 mm were also
   found in the intertidal zone, sometimes burrowed on exposed sandflats at
   low tide. Holothuria scabra avoided substrata of fine silt or shell and
   coral pebbles, and sediment with an organic content greater than or
   equal to 30%. Juveniles less than or equal to 100 mm burrowed at sunrise
   and surfaced at sunset. whereas individuals >100 mm burrowed and
   surfaced a few hours earlier. Halothuria scabra tended to burrow when
   salinity decreased, whereas increased water temperatures reduced normal
   burrowing behaviour. Spatial distribution, observed during tank
   experiments, suggested that adult H, scabra aggregated prior to spawning
   and in response to the lunar cycle. The formation of pairs. trios or
   larger groups increased during the new moon and was most common just
   before the full moon. Newly-settled juveniles up to ca. 9 mm were found
   on seagrass leaves. Typically, maximum densities and smallest recruits
   were observed a couple of weeks after the full moon, lower densities and
   slightly larger recruits were found a few days later. Juveniles with a
   mean length around 65 mm released on sand moved less and grew faster
   than juveniles released in seagrass beds or on substrata of shells and
   crushed coral.

AB We present a protocol for characterizing near-shore fish habitat as well
   as fish communities for Andros Island, Bahamas, a complex coastal-reef
   island system. Benthic assessments and beach seine surveys were carried
   out at sites varying in coastal and benthic characteristics. Temporal
   variability affected fish community composition, indicating that
   attempts to characterize a fish community should include sampling evenly
   across tides, times of day, and seasons. Univariate and multivariate
   analyses revealed that each site harbored a unique fish community, with
   the greatest variability within each site attributed to seasonal
   changes. Measures of diversity (Shannon-Weiner Index and number of
   species) were markedly different at sites with varying coverage of
   seagrass and macro-algae and extents of disturbance. Total abundance of
   fishes was positively related to the percent of bare sand. We suggest
   that thorough sampling of coastal fish communities can be applied to
   comparative and long-term studies. This protocol for the
   characterization of complex island habitats can be applied to ecological
   studies aimed at understanding the responses of fishes to small-scale
   changes in coastal areas and habitat structure due to land use and
   shoreline alterations.

AB The first published report of the snowflake coral in Hawaii comes from
   Pearl Harbor in 1972; subsequent identification as the Caribbean
   octocoral Carijoa nisei led to the general conclusion that it was
   introduced to Hawaii from a Caribbean source. In an attempt to confirm
   the source of the Hawaiian population, we used mitochondrial (mtDNA) and
   nuclear (nDNA) sequence data to compare Hawaiian populations with
   samples of Carijoa (N = 244) collected worldwide. In addition,
   cumulative vessel traffic patterns from 1940-1979 were compiled for the
   Pacific Ocean to determine maritime connectivity to and from Hawaii
   during the assumed time of introduction. Carijoa sampled from throughout
   Hawaii (N = 94) share none of the Caribbean mtDNA haplotypes and only a
   single nDNA allele (0 of 28 and 1 of 27, respectively), indicating that
   the Hawaiian populations derive from Indo-Pacific rather than
   Caribbean-Atlantic origins. Furthermore, both mtDNA and nDNA show
   significant isolation-by-distance patterns overall and among the Pacific
   and Hawaiian sampling regions. These data indicate that Carijoa is
   native to the Indo-Pacific. Published reports of geographically
   wide-ranging invasions of Carijoa throughout the Pacific appear
   unfounded because our global sampling shows higher diversity in mtDNA
   (He=0.87; pi=0.0023) and nDNA (D=0.91; pi=0.042) throughout the Pacific
   relative to the Caribbean-Atlantic, indicating long evolutionary
   presence of Carijoa in the region. Our data clearly refute a Caribbean
   origin for Carijoa in the Hawaiian Archipelago, and indicate that the
   genus Carijoa is native to the Pacific and in need of further taxonomic
   evaluation.

AB Antigua and Barbuda, located in the Caribbean, was one of the countries
   most affected by Hurricane Luis in 1995. Electricity, water supply and
   health facilities were disrupted for several weeks. Inadequate criteria
   at the design stages, unsound structural design, and lack of maintenance
   of building components, are some of the reasons that damage was so
   severe. The main hospitals and 6 health facilities were destroyed and
   flooded and most of the medical staff had to cope with their own damaged
   houses. Although the knowledge and materials are available to reduce the
   losses caused by hurricanes, building codes are not reinforced by laws
   and preventive maintenance to protect health care facilities from
   natural hazard damage is not usually budgeted for. The additional cost
   of making a single or two-storey health facility almost invulnerable to
   future catastrophe in a hurricane is only 2% in initial capital cost and
   becomes negligible when spread over the life of a building. The effort
   of UN International Decade for Natural Disasters (IDNDR) directed
   towards disaster mitigation should be increased over the remainder of
   the decade to ensure that standards are respected and building codes are
   mandatory.

AB Trichodesmium abundance and photosynthetic rates were determined across
   a transect of the Atlantic Barrier Reef at Carrie Bow Gay, Belize in May
   1993 and May-June 1994. A fore reef station receiving oceanic water had
   a Trichodesmium abundance characteristic of the open Caribbean Sea (less
   than or equal to 10(2) colonies m(-3) and 10(4)-10(5) trichomes .
   m(-3)). Several species were present; however, in all cases a sharp
   decrease in abundance occurred across the reef to the coastal lagoon. At
   this latter site, virtually no Trichodesmium was present, although a
   substantial bloom of the diatom Proboscia alata occurred in 1994.
   Maximum photosynthetic rates and the initial light-limited slope ct were
   significantly lower in offshore, stations than in reef top populations.
   The increased photosynthetic rates and light-harvesting ability in
   reef-top populations, as well as the lack of significant
   photoinhibition, indicated that the Trichodesmium abundance decrease was
   probably not due to a decline in photosynthetic capacity. Grazing and
   physical removal rather than a physiological decline were likely
   mechanisms operating to reduce Trichodesmium abundance in these regions.
   These data suggest that the Belizean barrier reef is a sink for
   Trichodesmium transported in from offshore regions.

   preliminary synthesis of data gathered by the Pacific Basin
   Biomonitoring Project. We examined levels of mercury, lead, cadmium,
   selenium, chromium, and manganese. For sooty terns (Sterna fuscata) and
   brown noddy (Anous stolidus) mercury levels were lower in the Pacific
   than in Puerto Rico in the Atlantic, but this was reversed for lead and
   cadmium. Adult birds had higher metal levels in their feathers than did
   young birds of the same species from the same area. Cadmium levels were
   higher in terrestrial species; lead, chromium, and manganese were
   highest in coastal species; and mercury and selenium were highest in
   marine species. Mercury levels were lowest in forest species,
   intermediate in species that eat insects and small vertebrates, and
   highest in species that eat intermediate to large fish. Lead levels were
   highest in species feeding in industrialized estuaries of Hong Kong.

AB Molecular and morphological data from newly collected specimens and a
   review of the literature and type material indicate that the widespread
   tropical sea hare Dolabrifera dolabrifera is a species complex of five
   genetically distinct taxa. The name Dolabrifera dolabrifera is retained
   for a widespread species in the Indo-Pacific tropics. Dolabrifera
   nicaraguana is endemic to the eastern Pacific. Dolabrifera ascifera, D.
   virens and a new species described herein are restricted to the tropical
   Atlantic, with partially overlapping ranges in the Caribbean region and
   St. Helena. The temperate Pacific species Dolabrifera brazieri is also
   distinct and endemic to temperate southeastern Australia and New
   Zealand. These species of Dolabrifera constitute highly divergent
   lineages and most contain unique internal anatomical characteristics,
   particularly in the male reproductive morphology and shell shape, making
   them relatively easy to identify upon dissection. However, externally
   all these species are extremely variable in colour pattern and
   morphology and are virtually indistinguishable. This is particularly
   problematic for identification in the Atlantic Ocean where three species
   co-occur in the Caribbean region.

AB On the oceanic Caribbean islands only a few hummingbird species are
   resident compared to the large number occurring in Central America. In
   these islands some with an area of over 70,000 km2) rarely more than 3
   spp. of trochilids form the nectarivorous guild (compared to over 20
   spp. occurring in relatively small areas in Central America). Species
   abundance is not related to size but to altitude (NN) of a given island,
   e.g., on St. Lucia (600 km2 area) as well as on Hispaniola (80,000 km2)
   3 hummingbird species are resident. With the exception of Cyanophaia
   bicolor on Dominica and Martinique all hummingbirds of the Caribbean
   archipelago show greater food and habitat versatility than most
   continental hummingbird species. The observed weight differences by
   nearly the factor of 2 in all members of the guild imply that a
   potential colonist succeeds only when responding to the wide range of
   ecological conditions (generalist) but must also fit into the weight
   characteristics of a given assembly. Species 3 times as large and/or 3
   times as small as their guild neighbors, are incompatible and do not
   occur. Hummingbirds have colonized the West Indies via 2 routes. The
   Greater Antilles and the Bahamas were reached from Central America,
   radiation on the Lesser Antilles originates in northern South America.
   This is evidenced by the close taxonomical relation to mainland species.
   Trochilus polytmus, T. scitulus and C. bicolor are still of doubtful
   taxonomic origin. The former 2, endemic on Jamaica form a superspecies.
   Based on ethological data (display, song) Trochilus should be placed
   systematically close to Chlorostilbon. The latter species, C. bicolor,
   endemic on Dominica and Martinique, has been associated systematically
   with the North American Cynanthus species group. It should have a
   systematic position closer to Hylocharis (cyanus-group) rather than to
   Cynanthus. Members of the Hylocharis cyanus-group are not only very
   similar to C.

AB This paper examines how oil palm migrant farmers in Papua New Guinea are
   responding to shortages of land for food gardening. Despite rapid
   population growth and planting nearly all of their land to oil palm,
   virtually all families continue to grow sufficient food for their
   families. The paper outlines the diverse range of adaptive strategies
   that households have employed to maintain food security, involving both
   intensification and innovation in farming systems. While gains from
   intensification have been significant and built resilience, they have
   been incremental, whereas innovation has been transformative and led to
   large gains in resilience. The adoption of more flexible land access
   arrangements on state leasehold land that revive' and adapt indigenous
   systems of land sharing and exchange that operated through kinship
   networks on customary land are innovative; they have increased the
   supply of land for food gardening thereby reducing risk for individual
   households and the broader smallholder community. The paper highlights
   the value of understanding farmer-driven innovations and the role of
   indigenous institutions and cultural values in sustaining and enhancing
   household food security.

   of the termite diversity in New Guinea. Altogether, 6 genera and 15
   species are recorded, among which two species, Coptotermes gambrinus and
   Parrhinotermes barbatus, are new to science. The genus Heterotermes is
   reported from New Guinea for the first time, with two species restricted
   to the southern part of the island. We also provide the first New Guinea
   records for six species of the genera Coptotermes and Schedorhinotermes.
   We briefly describe soldiers and imagoes of each species and provide a
   key based on soldier characters. Finally, we discuss the taxonomic and
   biogeographical implication of our results. A replacement name,
   Schedolimulus minutides Bourguignon, is proposed for the termitophilous
   staphylinid Schedolimulus minutus Bourguignon, to solve a question of
   secondary homonymy.

AB Remipedia is one of the most recently discovered classes of crustaceans,
   first described in 1981 from anchialine caves in the Bahamas
   Archipelago. The class is divided into the order Enantiopoda,
   represented by two fossil species, and Nectiopoda, which contains all
   known extant remipedes. Since their discovery, the number of nectiopodan
   species has increased to 24, half of which were described during the
   last decade. Nectiopoda exhibit a disjunct global distribution pattern,
   with the highest abundance and diversity in the Caribbean region, and
   isolated species in the Canary Islands and in Western Australia. Our
   review of Remipedia provides an overview of their ecological
   characteristics, including a detailed list of all anchialine marine
   caves, from which species have been recorded. We discuss alternative
   hypotheses of the phylogenetic position of Remipedia within Arthropoda,
   and present first results of an ongoing molecular-phylogenetic analysis
   that do not support the monophyly of several nectiopodan taxa. We
   believe that a taxonomic revision of Remipedia is absolutely essential,
   and that a comprehensive revision should include a reappraisal of the
   fossil record.

AB Osteological differences confirm the validity of two species of
   Grammatorcynus, G. bicarinatus (Quoy and Gaimard 1825) and the
   long-recognized G. bilineatus (Ruppell 1836). In addition to having
   fewer gill rakers (12-15 vs. 18-24), a smaller eye (3.1-4.6% vs.
   4.0-6.0% FL), small black spots on the lower sides of the body, and
   reaching a larger size (110 cm FL vs. 60 cm), G. bicarinatus differs
   from G. bilineatus in having a shorter neurocranium, shorter
   parasphenoid flanges, lower posterior edge of maxillary shank, shorter
   quadrate process, narrower first postcleithrum, wider ethmoid, wider
   vomer, wider lachrymal, longer teeth, wider palatine tooth patch, wider
   opercle, and a thin posttemporal shelf between the anterior processes.
   All but one of the 16 osteological differences previously found between
   Grammatorcynus bilineatus and Scomberomorus and Acanthocybium are
   confirmed with the inclusion of G. bicarinatus in the genus.
   Grammatorcynus bilineatus is widespread in tropical and subtropical
   waters of the Indo-West Pacific from the Red Sea to Tokelau Islands in
   Oceania. The range of G. bicarinatus is restricted to the western and
   eastern coasts of Australia and southern Papua New Guinea.

AB Carrying capacity, or the maximum potential population in a particular
   environment, has been an attractive concept for grasping
   human-environment relationships. This concept is expected to predict the
   future potential for human survival in rural areas of developing
   countries, taking sustainable development parameters into account. Since
   there are various problems in applying the carrying capacity to the real
   situations, however, revisions and additions to the conventional concept
   are apparently needed. Based on empirical information from Papua New
   Guinea communities, this paper aims to criticize the concept and
   proposes some alternations to it.

AB Spatial and temporal biodiversity patterns of free-living marine
   nematodes were studied in Cienfuegos Bay, a tropical semi-enclosed basin
   in the Caribbean Sea. Taxonomic (to species level) and functional
   (biological trait) approaches were applied for describing the assemblage
   structure and relating it to abiotic environment based on a sampling
   scheme in six subtidal stations and three months. Biological trait
   approach added relevant information to species pattern regarding
   relationships between diversity patterns and the abiotic environment.
   The most common morphotypes were deposit feeding nematodes, with
   colonising abilities of 2-3 (in a scale from 1 to 5), tail conical
   cylindrical or filiforme and body slender; and their abundance were
   correlated with depth, organic matter and silt/clay fraction. In spite
   of a high turnover of species, functional diversity of assemblages did
   not change notably in space and time. A result probably due to sampling
   of the habitat pool of species and to low heterogeneity of the studied
   muddy bottoms. Chemical pollution (organic enrichment and heavy metals)
   and hydrodynamic regime possibly drove the biodiversity patterns.
   Spatial distribution of assemblages support the existence of two well
   differentiated basins inside the bay, the northern basin more polluted
   than the southern one. The low hydrodynamic regime would determine a
   poor dispersion of nematodes resulting in high spatial variance in the
   assemblage structure; and also the associated hypoxic conditions and
   pollutants in sediments can explain the dominance of tolerant nematode
   species such as Daptonema oxycerca, Sabatieria pulchra, Terschellingia
   gourbaultae, and Terschellingia longicaudata. A comparison of
   spatial-temporal patterns of biodiversity between Cienfuegos Bay and
   other semi-enclosed bays in temperate regions suggests several
   similarities: nematode assemblages are strongly influenced by
   anthropogenic disturbance, temporal trends are weak or overridden by
   spatial ones, and few cosmopolitan genera/species tolerant to pollution
   and hypoxic conditions are dominant. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

AB The emergence of obesity and fatness across the second part of the 20th
   century has been documented for a number of Pacific Island populations.
   While dietary change and reduced physical activity levels associated
   with economic modernisation have been identified as the key factors
   fuelling the emergence of obesity, it is argued here that increasing
   numbers of Pacific Island migrants in the United States, New Zealand,
   France and Australia have provided the basis for the acceleration of the
   modernisation process by way of remittances, and the transmission of
   ideas of economic opportunity and change. Potential for migration for
   the Pacific Island nations is estimated from available data on
   population growth, total fertility rates and total mortality rates.
   Pacific Islander migrants form approximately one quarter of the total
   global Pacific Islander population, the majority of whom are from Tonga,
   Fiji, French Polynesia, and the Federated States of Micronesia. Per
   capita energy and fats and meat intake for the period 1961 to 2000 is
   described for five Pacific Island nations, showing that, in general,
   energy intakes have increased, as have the energy densities of the diets
   consumed. Thus the increase in mean body mass index observed in Pacific
   Islanders in the second half of the twentieth century can in general be
   attributed to dietary change associated with greater food and energy
   intake, and with increased consumption of fatty foods and meat, most of
   which are imports.

AB A peculiar aspect of western marginal seas is that some of them
   accommodate large transports whereas others, apparently similar seas,
   accommodate relatively small transports. For instance, about 30-40 Sv of
   Atlantic upper water passes through the Caribbean and yet only 2 Sv or
   so passes through the Sea of Japan. The passages connecting the
   Caribbean to the Atlantic are somewhat larger than their Sea of Japan
   counterparts, but the dimensions of the gaps are too similar to each
   other to account for the large difference in the transports.
   Four different baroclinic models are used to investigate the problem.
   First, we used a wind-driven, layer-and-a-half isopycnal model with an
   idealized basin and an adjacent marginal sea separated from the main
   basin by a thin and long island. In this scenario, thermocline water
   enters the marginal sea via a gap to the Youth of the island and exits
   the sea via a gap to the north of the island. The mean latitudinal
   position of the marginal sea is gradually increased and the numerical
   transport across the sea is measured. We then compared the transport
   determined this way to that computed using three analytical baroclinic
   models: Godfrey's island rule (Godfrey, J. S. (1989). A Sverdrup model
   of the depth-integrated flow for the world ocean allowing for island
   circulations. Geophysical and Astrophysical Fluid Dynamics, 45,
   89-112.), the 'beta-controlled' transport formula (Nof, D. (1993). The
   penetration of Kuroshio water into the Sea of Japan. Journal of Physical
   Oceanography, 23, 797-807), and the general gap transport formula (Nof,
   D., (1995). Choked flows and wind-driven interbasin exchange. Journal of
   Marine Research, 53, 23-48). The results were also compared to Minato
   and Kimura's (Minato, S., & Kimura, R. (1980). Volume transport of the
   western boundary current penetrating into a marginal sea. Journal of the
   Oceanographic Society of Japan, 36, 185-195) barotropic calculations.
   All four baroclinic models show that, when the marginal sea is situated
   in low and midlatitude, the penetration of thermocline water into the
   marginal sea decreases rapidly with increased latitude. By contrast, in
   equatorial marginal seas, the penetration of thermocline water increases
   with increasing latitude, Minato and Kimura's (1980) barotropic model
   shows a similar behavior except that the maximum transport occurs at a
   much higher latitude, Excellent agreement between the numerics and
   Grodfrey's island rule formula is found in equatorial seas. As the
   latitude of the marginal sea increases to low and mid latitudes, the
   deviations from the: numerics increase dramatically though the agreement
   is still very reasonable,
   Both the beta-controlled formula and the gap formula are relatively
   accurate in mid latitudes when the sea is close to the separation
   latitude. The importance of frictional forces within the western
   boundary current results in the beta-controlled formula failing for
   marginal seas situated far away from the separation latitude, Similarly,
   the general gap formula fails in equatorial latitudes where there is no
   western boundary current south of the island.
   On the basis of all four baroclinic models, it is suggested that the
   reason for the small transport within the Sea of Japan (relative to the
   Caribbean) is its relatively high latitude and not the size of the gaps
   connecting it to the pacific Ocean (or frictional effects), (C) 2000

AB Every year 2800 deaths in Pacific island countries result from
   diarrhoea, and most are children under five years of age. These tragic
   diarrheal deaths are preventable as they are often linked to unsafe
   water, lack of proper sanitation facilities and poor hygienic practices.
   Effective preventive management through the framework of a drinking
   Water Safety Plan (WSP) is an efficient mechanism for ensuring the safe
   quality of drinking water thereby reducing the burden of water related
   diseases. The large proportion (81%) of people in Pacific island
   countries living in rural or outer island communities mostly have their
   own water supply (for example rainwater tanks or hand-dug wells), and
   often the water is consumed untreated. The remoteness and isolation of
   these rural communities prevent national surveillance authorities to
   regularly visit and provide advice on drinking water safety issues. In
   such circumstances empowering rural communities to ensure the safety of
   their drinking water, through trained local facilitators, could be
   promoted and utilised effectively. However, WSPs for rural communities
   have to be relatively simple hence tools such as modified sanitary
   inspections and the presence/absence hydrogen sulfide test could be
   used. The approach of empowering communities through trained local
   facilitators to promote the WSP framework has been implemented in the
   Republic of Marshall Islands (RMI). Positive feedback has been received
   by trained facilitators in RMI on the use of modified sanitary
   inspections (translated into Marshallese) and the hydrogen sulfide test.
   It is believed that the approach of empowering communities on WSPs
   through training local facilitators and equipping them with the above
   mentioned simple tools is effective and has potential for further
   replication in rural Pacific communities to improve drinking water
   quality and reduce the burden of water related diseases.

AB Scyllaeidae represents a small clade of dendronotoid nudibranchs.
   Notobryon wardi Odhner, 1936, has been reported to occur in tropical
   oceans from the Indo-Pacific and eastern Pacific to temperate South
   Africa. The systematics of Notobryon has not been reviewed using modern
   systematic tools. Here, specimens of Notobryon were examined from the
   eastern Pacific, the Indo-Pacific, and from temperate South Africa.
   Additionally, representatives of Scyllaea and Crosslandia were studied.
   Scyllaeidae was found to be monophyletic. Notobryon was also found to be
   monophyletic and is the sister group to Crosslandia plus Scyllaea. The
   molecular data also clearly indicate that within Notobryon, at least
   three distinct species are present, two of which are here described.
   Genetic distance data indicate that eastern Pacific and South African
   exemplars are 1023% divergent from Indo-Pacific exemplars of Notobryon
   wardi. Scyllaea pelagica has been regarded as a single, circumtropical
   species. Our molecular studies clearly indicate that the Atlantic and
   Indo-Pacific populations are distinct and we resurrect Scyllaea fulva
   Quoy & Gaimard, 1824 for the Indo-Pacific species. Our morphological
   studies clearly corroborate our molecular findings and differences in
   morphology distinguish closely related species. Different species
   clearly have distinct penial morphology. These studies clearly reinforce
   the view that eastern Pacific, Indo-Pacific, and temperate biotas
   consist largely of distinct faunas, with only a minor degree of faunal
   overlap. (c) 2012 The Linnean Society of London, Zoological Journal of

AB In February 1998, green mussels were first observed during the
   collection of mangrove roots from Kingston Harbour on the south coast of
   Jamaica by researchers at the University of the West Indies, Mona.
   Preliminary observations of its morphological characteristics identified
   the mussel as Perna viridis, and this was confirmed by reference to the
   retractor muscle scars on the inside of the shells and ultimately by
   chromosome number. Prior to the first sighting in Jamaica, P. viridis
   was seen in Trinidad (1990), and subsequently in Tampa Bay, Florida
   (1999). A preliminary survey of 29 random sites was carried out in July
   1999, which revealed that the mussel had established itself at numerous
   sites around the Harbour. Ten of these sites were monitored monthly for
   one year from February 2000 to January 2001 for mussel density,
   physicochemical parameters, suspended solids, microalgae, and gut
   contents. Densities varied throughout the year and appeared to be
   affected by salinity, substrate availability and removal by persons.
   Analysis of the gut contents of several of these mussels revealed the
   presence of four species of toxic microalgae, as well as a large amount
   of organic material. Further studies aimed at following the spread of
   this invading species are in progress.

AB Although it is commonly assumed that female sea turtles always return to
   the beach they hatched, the pathways they use during the years preceding
   their first reproduction and their natal origins are most often unknown,
   as it is the case for juvenile green turtles found in Martinique waters
   in the Caribbean. Given the oceanic circulation of the Guiana current
   flowing toward Martinique and the presence of important nesting sites
   for this species in Suriname and French Guiana, we may assume that a
   large proportion of the juvenile green turtles found in Martinique are
   originating from the Suriname-French Guiana beaches. To confirm this
   hypothesis, we performed mixed stock analysis (MSA) on 40 green turtles
   sampled in Martinique Island and satellite tracked 31 juvenile green
   turtles tagged in Martinique to (a) assess their natal origin and (b)
   identify their destination. Our results from MSA confirm that these
   juveniles are descendant from females laying on several Caribbean and
   Atlantic beaches, mostly from Suriname and French Guiana, but also from
   more southern Brazilian beaches. These results were confirmed by the
   tracking data as the 10 turtles leaving Martinique headed across the
   Caribbean-Atlantic region in six different directions and 50% of these
   turtles reached the Brazilian foraging grounds used by the adult green
   turtles coming from French Guiana. One turtle left the French Guianan
   coast to perform the first transatlantic migration ever recorded in
   juvenile green turtles, swimming toward Guinea-Bissau, which is the most
   important nesting site for green turtles along the African coast. The
   extensive movements of the migrant turtles evidenced the crossing of
   international waters and more than 25 exclusive economic zones,
   reinforcing the need for an international cooperative network to ensure
   the conservation of future breeders in this endangered species.

AB During 2010-2012, northern South America experienced one of the
   strongest wet seasons during the recent decades, with socio-economic
   implications of wide proportions. This period was characterized by two
   stronger-than-average La Nia events, one occurred in 2010-2011 and
   another less intense event in 2011-2012. This study focused on
   identifying the main moisture sources, besides the eastern Pacific, for
   the anomalous wet season occurred in this region during 2010-2012, and
   their association with the La Nia events observed in the equatorial
   Pacific. The results discussed here suggest that the main moisture
   sources to this anomalous wet season were the Pacific Ocean (via the
   westerly flow of the Choco jet) and the Caribbean Sea (via the weakening
   of the Caribbean low-level jet and the development of southward
   anomalies toward northern South America). Such changes appear to be
   associated not only to El Nio-Southern Oscillation (ENSO)-driven sea
   surface temperature anomalies in the eastern Pacific, Caribbean Sea, and
   north Atlantic, but also to ENSO-independent variability in the Atlantic
   Ocean. The latter is related to an enhanced Atlantic Meridional Mode.

AB Jamaica's water supply sector is recognized as the largest electricity
   consumer in the island's public sector. This paper evaluates whether
   replacing high-cost groundwater abstraction with surface water treatment
   and distribution is a viable option to minimize electricity consumption
   in the water sector. The findings suggest that a change from groundwater
   abstraction to surface water treatment and distribution by conveying
   surface water around the island incurs higher electricity costs compared
   to the present supply model (reliance on ground water). However, as part
   of a strategy for a more efficient water sector it is recommended that
   the above approach be further evaluated with more economic
   considerations, engineering designs and possible storage facilities to
   reduce the time of pumping of ground water.

   Pterois volitans on Caribbean fish communities requires a thorough
   understanding of the species' predation behaviour in the invaded range,
   including the types and amounts of prey consumed and how foraging
   patterns vary in relation to extrinsic conditions. We studied the
   activity levels and prey consumption rates of lionfish on 12 shallow
   coral reefs in the Bahamas in relation to time of day and prey
   availability. Lionfish predation rates and activity levels were
   significantly higher during crepuscular (dawn and dusk) periods than at
   mid-day. Available prey fish biomass was highest at dawn but lower at
   mid-day and dusk, suggesting that lionfish predation activity is not
   limited by prey availability alone. Our calculated average daily
   mass-specific prey consumption rates, which incorporated daily
   variation, was similar to 3 times the estimates obtained from studies of
   captive lionfish in their native range and of invasive lionfish observed
   only during the day. Our results will help to predict more accurately
   the effect of predation by invasive lionfish on native reef fish
   communities.

AB Solomon Islanders are highly dependent on their coastal resources for
   food and livelihoods. Parts of some islands are now quite densely
   populated and some groups are being forced to adapt to resource
   scarcities. One such adaptation is the relatively recent development of
   nocturnal fisheries for small coastal pelagic fish in Langalanga Lagoon,
   Malaita Province, in tandem with declining reef fish stocks. The
   technique involves using lights to attract fish to gill nets and
   strike-lines deployed from dugout canoes anchored in and around lagoon
   passages. In the first detailed study of a fishery based on this gear
   combination in the Pacific, we report a mean catch-per-unit-effort
   (CPUE) from over 190 light fishing trips of 3.41 kg/h/person. This
   figure is two to five times higher than CPUE's obtained for
   reef-associated fisheries in Solomon Islands, including sites with much
   lower population and market pressures. The main targets of the light
   fishery were clupeids, along with small carangids, small sphyraenids and
   small scornbrids. Interviews with fishers revealed there were regular
   seasonal fluctuations in the abundance of the dominant species
   (Amblygaster sirm, the Spotted Sardinella) but no long-term (i.e.
   decadal) variation. Langalanga people now rely heavily on this
   high-yielding fishery for subsistence and cash, and some said they would
   need to relocate in search of alternate livelihoods if it did not exist.
   The high fecundity, rapid growth, early maturation and short life span
   of the key target species indicate that stocks are likely to be much
   more resilient than those of most reef-associated species. Many aspects
   of the behaviour and ecology of the key species remain poorly
   understood. However we argue that this study should encourage more
   scientists and fishery managers to think beyond reef-centric and larval
   connectivity-based models of tropical coastal fishery production and
   food security, and to pay much closer attention to biological
   oceanographic processes, including nutrient inputs, which fundamentally
   underpin the productivity of these increasingly important small pelagic
   fisheries. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Hurricanes are common, potentially catastrophic events for ecosystems in
   the Caribbean.  We synthesize the work reported in this issue, together
   with the existing literature, to discuss effects of hurricanes on
   Caribbean ecosystems and to highlight priorities for future work. 
   Comparisons of the impacts of hurricanes on different ecosystems are
   made difficult by the lack of detailed meterological data, lack of
   prehurricane ecological data and differences between studies in types
   and timing of measurements made.
   Effects of recent hurricanes on Caribbean forest ecosystems include: 
   defoliation, ranging from complete in lowland wet forest in Nicaragua
   after Hurricane Joan to negligible in parts of Jamaican montane forest
   after Hurricane Gilbert; felling of trees by uprooting and snapping (80%
   in Nicaragua to 14% in Jamaica); and tree mortality, which is rarely
   recorded and generally low (13% in the Yucatan following Hurricane
   Gilbert to 3% in Puerto Rican montane forests following Hurricane Hugo).
   Damage to individual trees varies with topographic location, stand
   characteristics, tree size (large ones uprooting and small ones snapping
   in Dominica during Hurricane David, but not in Jamaica), and species
   characteristics (such as wood density), but it is difficult to
   generalize about these factors.
   Effects on animal populations are both direct and through reductions in
   food supplies.  Frugivorous and nectarivorous birds were more severely
   affected than insectivorous species in the Virgin Islands and Jamaica. 
   There is little information about hurricane effects on insect
   populations, but populations of two species of walking sticks in Puerto
   Rico declined sharply after Hurricane Hugo.  Numbers of adults of one
   frog species in Puerto Rico quadrupoled after Hurricane Hugo, but
   numbers of juveniles were severely reduced by the storm.
   Effects of hurricanes on the physical environment include modified
   microclimates due to increased light penetration through defoliated
   canopies and landslides triggered by rainfall.  Increased litterfall led
   to increases in some soil nutrients, and fine root biomass was
   drastically reduced in a Puerto Rican montane forest.
   Recovery of forest ecosystems from hurricanes depends on a combination
   of seedling growth and resprouting of canopy trees.  In several studies,
   seed germination was promoted by higher light and/or higher temperature,
   but seedling mortality also increased.  The relative importance of newly
   germinated seedlings, advance regeneration, and regrowth of damaged
   adults has not been studied.  The few long-term studies of adult trees
   show the expected decline in the proportion of pioneer and intolerant
   species with time after disturbance.
   Hurricanes may be the most important factor controlling species
   composition and some aspects of ecosystem dynamics in the Caribbean;
   there is much still to be learned, and we suggest some priorities for
   future research.

AB Many coral reef fishes have restricted depth ranges that are established
   at settlement or soon after, but the factors limiting these
   distributions are largely unknown. This study examines whether the
   availability of microhabitats (reef substrata) explains depth limits,
   and evaluates whether juvenile growth and survival are lower beyond
   these limits. Depth-stratified surveys of reef fishes at Kimbe Bay
   (Papua New Guinea) showed that the abundance of new settlers and the
   cover of coral substrata differed significantly among depths. A field
   experiment investigated whether settling coral reef fishes preferred
   particular depths, and whether these depth preferences were dependent on
   microhabitat. Small patch reefs composed of identical coral substrata
   were set up at five depths (3, 6, 10, 15 and 20 m), and settlement
   patterns were compared to those on unmanipulated reef habitat at the
   same five depths. For all species, settlement on patch reefs differed
   significantly among depths despite uniform substratum composition. For
   four of the six species tested, depth-related settlement patterns on
   unmanipulated habitat and on patch reefs did not differ, while for the
   other two, depth ranges were greater on the patch reefs than on
   unmanipulated habitat. A second experiment examined whether depth
   preferences reflected variation in growth and survival when microhabitat
   was similar. Newly settled individuals of Chrysiptera parasema and
   Dascyllus melanurus were placed, separately, on patch reefs at five
   depths (as above) and their survival and growth monitored. D. melanurus,
   which is restricted to shallow depths, had highest survival and growth
   at the shallowest depth. Depth did not affect either survival or growth
   of C. parasema, which has a broader depth range than D. melanurus
   (between 6 and 15 m). This suggests that the fitness costs potentially
   incurred by settling outside a preferred depth range may depend on the
   strength of the depth preference.

AB Palynologists interested in better understanding the sedimentation and
   energy of depositional environments have often included studies of
   palynomaceral fragments, particularly when performing palynofacies
   analyses. Due to the difficult nature of classifying these fragments,
   researchers have developed numerous, often overlapping, classification
   schemes. These different schemes make it difficult to compare and
   contrast between research projects. Determining the appropriate scheme
   to apply when counting these fragments can be confusing, and application
   of these schemes can yield inconclusive results, especially when
   sedimentation and energy are in constant flux. A scheme of five
   categories, including brown wood (palynomaceral 1-2), leaf cuticle
   (palynomaceral 3), black debris (palynomaceral 4), structureless organic
   matter (SOM) and resin, is utilised here. It is applied to the analysis
   of 64 modern samples from the top 0-4 cm of sediment collected
   throughout the Gulf of Papua, Papua New Guinea. These samples span a
   suite of common marine depositional environments: river mouths and
   deltas, the proximal portion of the continental shelf dominated by a
   large clinoform, and turbidite and hemipelagic/pelagic deposits on the
   slope and in the deep ocean basin. Principal component analysis (PCA)
   confirms this simplified classification scheme provides an indirect
   means of assessing distance from shore and shelf-slope break, overall
   water depth and sediment accumulation rate, but other factors, such as
   processing technique, marine productivity, sediment source, time in
   transport and residence and bioturbation, are taken into account to
   fully explain distribution.

AB The high-resolution delta O-18 and delta C-13 records of benthic
   foraminifera from a 150,000-year long core from the Caribbean Sea
   indicate that there was generally high delta C-13 during glaciations and
   low delta C-13 during interglaciations. Due to its 1800-m sill depth,
   the properties of deep water in the Caribbean Sea are similar to those
   of middepth tropical Atlantic water. During interglaciations the water
   filling the deep Caribbean Sea is an admixture of low delta C-13 Upper
   Circumpolar Water (UCPW) and high delta C-13 Upper North Atlantic Deep
   Water (UNADW). By contrast only high delta C-13 UNADW enters during
   glaciations. Deep ocean circulation changes can influence atmospheric
   CO2 levels (Broecker and Takahashi, 1985; Boyle, 1988a; Keir, 1988;
   Broecker and Peng, 1989). By comparing delta C-13 records of benthic
   foraminifera from cores lying in Southern Ocean Water, the Caribbean
   Sea, and at several other Atlantic Ocean sites, the thermohaline state
   of the Atlantic Ocean (how close it was to a full glacial or full
   interglacial configuration) is characterized. A continuum of circulation
   patterns between the glacial and interglacial extremes appears to have
   existed in the past. Subtracting the deep Pacific (similar to mean ocean
   water) delta C-13 record from the Caribbean delta C-13 record yields a
   record which describes large changes in the Atlantic Ocean thermohaline
   circulation. The delta C-13 difference varies as the vertical nutrient
   distribution changes. This new proxy record bears a striking resemblance
   to the 150,000-year-long atmospheric CO2 record (Bamola et al., 1987).
   This favorable comparison between the new proxy record and the
   atmospheric CO2 record is consistent with Boyle's (1988a) model that
   vertical nutrient redistribution has driven large atmospheric CO2
   changes in the past. Changes in the relative contribution of NADW and
   Pacific outflow water to the Southern Ocean are also consistent with
   Broecker and Peng's (1989) recent model for atmospheric CO2 changes.

AB Dinoflagellates are frequently abundant in the coral-reef mangrove
   lagoons off the coast of Belize. Margalef predicted that marine
   environments with low turbulence and high nutrient inputs would favor
   dinoflagellates. A long-term study of coral-reef mangrove embayment cays
   of Belize, including this study, has shown that these systems contain
   abundant dinoflagellate species. Consistent with Margalef's prediction,
   these habitats are protected from wind mixing, show a high degree of
   stratification, and have restricted water exchange with surrounding
   oligotrophic waters of the open barrier-reef system. This limited water
   exchange favors retention of dinoflagellate cells and the trapping of
   nutrient rich organic material that is rapidly recycled providing a
   relatively high-nutrient environment. Species-specific blooms are a
   common feature of these systems. In the study, the ecology and diversity
   of dinoflagellate species from two nutrient-enriched habitats, Douglas
   Cay and The Lair at Twin Cay, were examined in detail. A comparison of
   the species composition from both sites showed that Douglas Cay
   contained coastal planktonic and offshore oceanic dinoflagellates while
   The Lair at Twin Cay contained mainly benthic dinoflagellates. A total
   of 19 bloom-forming species were observed in these systems during three
   two-week studies. The morphology of eight of these bloom-forming species
   is illustrated in Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) photographs. These
   include Bysmatrum caponii, Dinophysis caudata, Gonyaulax grindleyi,
   Peridinium quinquecorne, Gonyaulax. polygramma, Gonyaulax spinifera,
   Lingulodinium polyedrum, and Pyrodinium bahamense var. bahamense.
   Approximately half of the bloom-forming dinoflagellates are known toxin
   producers. The congruence between Margalef's prediction and the
   distribution of dinoflagellates in these naturally eutrophic systems
   suggests that increased nutrient inputs in oligotrohic portions of the
   Caribbean will favor a shift in species dominance toward dinoflagellate
   species. The effect will be most pronounced in bays or other regions
   where turbulence is likely to be reduced. This species shift may have
   consequences for food web dynamics and the prevalence of dinoflagellate
   toxins in the food chain.

AB The analysis of environmental DNA (eDNA) is a powerful, non-destructive
   technique for detecting rare or hard to find freshwater organisms. In
   this study, we investigated the effectiveness of environmental DNA
   analysis as a method for detecting a rare amphibian, the golden tree
   frog (Phytotriades auratus). These frogs are believed to live
   exclusively within one species of tank bromeliad, Glomeropitcairnia
   erectiflora, found on the highest peaks of the island of Trinidad in the
   West Indies. Previous survey methods for this species involved bromeliad
   destruction, while here we collected and analyzed water samples from
   discrete pools within G. erectiflora plants for species-specific DNA. We
   found 1) that we can identify the presence of P. auratus in the
   bromeliads using environmental DNA analysis, and 2) that environmental
   DNA evidence indicates the presence of a previously undiscovered P.
   auratus population, increasing the species' range from two isolated 'sky
   islands' to three.

AB The Caribbean is experiencing a host of serious socioeconomic problems
   that prevent the majority of the population from realizing and
   maintaining a satisfactory standard of living.  Food and Nutrition
   Surveys of some countries identified a lack of information on health,
   food, and nutrition as a primary reason for the prevalence of
   malnutrition, infectious diseases, and nutrition related diseases. 
   "Misinformation" creates an often insurmountable barrier to effective
   communication between source and receiver, in this case the health,
   food, and nutrition sector and the wider community.  Misinformation
   occurs when the message is either incorrect, incomplete, inconsistent
   with other messages in the same program, or contradictory.  This element
   of "misinformation" can negate the effectiveness of the message and an
   entire communication program.  Some examples are cited which show that
   in programs aimed at effecting change in attitude or behavior it is
   essential to ensure that messages are clearly communicated to avoid
   misunderstanding and the right infrastructure is in place for the
   innovation proposed by the message to be carried out.  In the Jamaica
   Nutrition Education Program (JNEP) were used to communicate the
   messages.  Evaluation revealed that health staff were providing
   incorrect and contradictory advice about breastfeeding, which showed
   that they lacked basic information on the subject.  In Barbados, despite
   an intensified health education campaign, face to face instruction in
   the clinics, and extensive use of the Caribbean Food and Nutrition
   Institute (CFNI) Breastfeeding Package as well as other locally
   developed materials, a marked decline in breastfeeding was recorded over
   the 1969-81 survey period.  Misinformation and misunderstanding among
   mothers were identified as the key reasons for the failure of
   breastfeeding.  In relation to the decline in breaastfeeding and
   incorrect weaning practices, mass media was implicated as luring mothers
   away from natural feeding methods towards the use of expensive imported
   products.  A 1976 CFNI meeting established strong linkages between mass
   media and nutrition personnel and was the factor most responsible for
   the selection of an advertising/marketing approach as the chief
   component of the mass media strategy.  In sum, there is more to
   communication than mere information transfer.  Effective communication
   can produce/create the right climate for change to occur.  The nature of
   the message is an important determining factor in attitude and behavior
   change, and the message must fit the intended audience.  The medium of
   the message must be appropriate, culturally relevant, familiar and
   liked.

AB The beetle Brontispa longissima (Gestro) (Coleoptera: Chrysomelidae) is
   a serious invasive pest of the coconut palm, Cocos nucifera L., in
   Southeast Asia and the Pacific region. Genetic analysis is essential to
   ecological and evolutionary study of such invasive species. We therefore
   conducted molecular analyses by using partial sequences (1044 bp) of the
   mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase subunit I (COI) genes of B. longissima
   collected from several locations. We found two monophyletic groups: one
   distributed over a limited area (Australia, Papua New Guinea, Samoa, and
   Sumba Island; referred to as the Pacific group) and the other collected
   from a wide area of Asia and the Pacific region (referred to as the
   Asian group). We compared the biological and morphological traits of the
   two groups. We found that insects in the Pacific group had a shorter
   developmental time from hatching to adult emergence, produced fewer
   eggs, and had a larger adult body size than insects in the Asian group.
   Elytral color patterns did not differ between the two groups. Our
   interpopulation crosses produced significantly fewer progeny than
   intrapopulation crosses, suggesting that B. longissima represents two
   cryptic species.

AB Frugivorous dacine fruit flies were studied in a lowland tropical rain
   forest in Papua New Guinea to determine their host specificity,
   abundance, and the number of species attacking various plant species.
   Plant species hosted 0-3 fruit fly species at median (1-3 quartile)
   densities of 1. (0-17) fruit flies per 100 fruits. Fruit flies were
   mostly specialized to a single plant family (83%, species) and within
   each family to a single genus (88%) species), while most of the species
   (66%) were able to feed on > 1. congeneric plant species. Only 30 from
   the 53 studied plant species were colonized by fruit flies. The
   plant-fruit fly food web, including these 30 plant species and the total
   of 29 fruit fly species feeding on them, was divided into 14
   compartments, each including 1-8 plant species hosting mutually disjunct
   assemblages of fruit flies. This structure minimizes indirect
   interactions among plant species via shared herbivores. The local
   species pool was estimated at 152 132 ( SE) fruit fly species. Forty per
   cent of all taxonomically described species known from Papua New Guinea
   were reared or trapped in our study area. Such a high proportion
   indicates low beta-diversity of fruit flies. Steiner traps were highly
   efficient in sampling the lure-responsive fruit fly species as they
   re-collected 84% of all species trapped in the same area 5 y before.
   Fruit fly monitoring by these traps is a cheap, simple and efficient
   method for the study of spatial and temporal changes in rain-forest
   communities.

AB Rebeca Gasca (2009) Diversity of hyperiid amphipods (Crustacea:
   Peracarida) in the western Caribbean Sea: news from the deep. Zoological
   Studies 48(1): 63-70. Previous surveys of hyperiid amphipods from the
   western Caribbean were largely restricted to the epipelagic layer (0-200
   m in depth). The need for deeper sampling in the area has been
   recognized in some work; presumably, this strategy would significantly
   increase knowledge of the local and regional diversity of this and other
   zooplankton taxa. Hyperiid amphipods collected at an expanded sampling
   range (0-940 m) in Mexican waters of the northwestern (NW) Caribbean,
   were taxonomically analyzed. Samples were collected during 2 cruises
   (2002 and 2006), using different sampling gear on each one. In total, 92
   hyperiid species were found; 32 species had not hitherto been recorded
   in the area, thus increasing (from 60 to 92, 50%) the number of species
   currently known in this part of the Caribbean. Some of these species
   were recorded for the first time in the NW Caribbean or in Mexican
   territorial waters. A greater relative increase was observed among the
   Physosomata, a group known to contain mainly meso- and bathypelagic
   forms. A revised, expanded checklist of the hyperiids of the NW
   Caribbean is also provided; this area is now among the best studied in
   the NW tropical Atlantic, which in turn still has a low number of
   records compared to other regions of the world. These results confirm
   that 1) significant increases of local and regional lists of hyperiids
   may be expected from more sampling efforts in deeper layers, and 2) this
   and other groups of tropical oceanic zooplankton deserve further study
   in this environment. http://zoolstud.sinica.edu.tw/Journals/48.1/63.pdf

AB Objective: There has been little inquiry addressing whether or not
   concerns about adverse effects of energy drink usage are relevant in the
   Caribbean. This survey investigated energy drink usage and adverse
   consequences among tertiary level students in Trinidad and Tobago.
   Methods: A cross-sectional survey of 1994 students from eight
   institutions was conducted using a de novo questionnaire based on
   findings from a focus group of students. Chi-squared analyses and
   logistic regression were used to assess relationships between energy
   drink usage, adverse effects and other factors affecting energy drink
   use, and to verify predictors of energy drink use.
   Results: Prevalence of use was 86%; 38% were current users. Males were
   more likely to use, used more frequently and at an earlier age. Energy
   drinks were used most commonly to increase energy (50%), combat
   sleepiness (45%) and enhance academic performance (40%), and occurred
   during sports (23%) and mixed with alcohol (22.2%). The majority (79.6%)
   consumed one energy drink per sitting; 62.2% experienced adverse
   effects, most commonly restlessness (22%), jolt and crash (17.1%) and
   tachycardia (16.6%). Awareness of adverse effects was associated with no
   use (p = 0.004), but adverse effects were not a deterrent to continued
   use.
   Conclusion: Energy drink usage is prevalent among students. The use is
   not excessive, but associated with high rates of adverse effects and
   occurs in potentially dangerous situations like during exercise and with
   alcohol. There is a need to educate students about the potential adverse
   effects of energy drinks. (C) 2014 Ministry of Health, Saudi Arabia.

AB Background
   In response to a 2011 cholera outbreak in Papua New Guinea, the
   Government of the Solomon Islands initiated a cholera prevention program
   which included cholera disease prevention and treatment messaging,
   community meetings, and a pre-emptive cholera vaccination campaign
   targeting 11,000 children aged 1-15 years in selected communities in
   Choiseul and Western Provinces.
   Methodology and Principal Findings
   We conducted a post-vaccination campaign, household-level survey about
   knowledge, attitudes, and practices regarding diarrhea and cholera in
   areas targeted and not targeted for cholera vaccination. Respondents in
   vaccinated areas were more likely to have received cholera education in
   the previous 6 months (33% v. 9%; p = 0.04), to know signs and symptoms
   (64% vs. 22%; p = 0.02) and treatment (96% vs. 50%; p = 0.02) of
   cholera, and to be aware of cholera vaccine (48% vs. 14%; p = 0.02).
   There were no differences in water, sanitation, and hygiene practices.
   Conclusions
   This pre-emptive OCV campaign in a cholera-naive community provided a
   unique opportunity to assess household-level knowledge, attitudes, and
   practices regarding diarrhea, cholera, and water, sanitation, and
   hygiene (WASH). Our findings suggest that education provided during the
   vaccination campaign may have reinforced earlier mass messaging about
   cholera and diarrheal disease in vaccinated communities.

AB Pacific red lionfish Pterois volitans, introduced to Atlantic waters in
   the 1980s, represent a particularly successful invasive marine predator
   with strong effects on native prey. Previous experiments examining the
   effects of lionfish on native fish communities have been conducted on
   small patch reefs. However, the effects of lionfish on native reef-fish
   communities over larger spatial scales-scales at which conservation and
   management efforts are typically applied-have not been examined
   experimentally. Beginning in June 2009, I conducted a large-scale field
   experiment near Lee Stocking Island, Bahamas. Ten large (1400 to 4000
   m(2)) coral reefs were paired based on location and similarity of
   habitat, and baseline surveys of their fish communities were conducted.
   Quarterly removals of lionfish were then conducted on 1 reef in each
   pair, while the densities of lionfish on the other reefs were
   standardized at typical post-invasion levels. Through August 2010,
   quarterly surveys showed that lionfish caused significant changes in
   native reef-fish communities, including reductions in the total density
   (up to 46.3 +/- 13.7%, mean +/- SEM), biomass (31.9 +/- 10.7%), and
   species richness (21.4 +/- 9.1%) of prey-sized fishes (all individuals
   <10 cm total length). Lionfish also caused substantial reductions in the
   biomass of prey-sized herbivorous fishes (33.9 +/- 16.0%) and piscivores
   (98.6 +/- 39.5%). However, these negative effects on small fish did not
   translate to observable declines in a larger size-class (all individuals
   10 to 20 cm total length) over the 14 mo study period.

AB Objective. Determine the distribution and biogeographic affinity of the
   galateoid species found in Colombian waters. The study is based upon
   bibliographic data and samples collected during expeditions between 1999
   and 2002. Materials and methods. Samples of galateoids were collected
   from 100 locations, from depths ranging between 20 and 550 m, along the
   Pacific and Caribbean coasts of Colombia. The collected material and
   geographic information were used to create distribution maps, which were
   compared with the Marine Ecoregions of the World classification.
   Results. A total of 3247 specimens of 18 species of the genera
   Agononida, Anomoeomunida, Munida, Munidoposis y Pleuroncodes were
   collected in the Caribbean and Pacific regions, and the information was
   completed with bibliographic data from 40 species of the superfamily
   with known presence in Colombian waters. Five main distribution groups
   of species were established: Caribbean, Caribbean and Western Atlantic,
   pan-Atlantic, Eastern Pacific, and Pan-American. Comparisons with the
   Marine Ecoregions of The World Map showed that 53 % of the collected
   species in the Caribbean are also present in the temperate region of the
   North Atlantic and the East Tropical Pacific province. The greatest
   affinity among the Colombian Pacific species was found in the Eastern
   Tropical region of the Pacific Ocean. Conclusions. Ample geographic and
   bathymetric ranges of Galateoids are present in Colombian marine
   environments, showing a sympatric distribution among some species.
   Shallow water species presented more restrictions than deep water ones.
   The distribution mechanisms of the species correspond with their life
   cycle and the predominant currents of each province.

AB Studies on the role of diet in the development of chronic diseases often
   rely on self-report surveys of dietary intake. Unfortunately, many
   validity studies have demonstrated that self-reported dietary intake is
   subject to systematic under-reporting, although the vast majority of
   such studies have been conducted in industrialised countries. The aim of
   the present study was to investigate whether or not systematic reporting
   error exists among the individuals of African ancestry (n 324) in five
   countries distributed across the Human Development Index (HDI) scale, a
   UN statistic devised to rank countries on non-income factors plus
   economic indicators. Using two 24 h dietary recalls to assess energy
   intake and the doubly labelled water method to assess total energy
   expenditure, we calculated the difference between these two values
   ((self-report 2 expenditure/ expenditure) x 100) to identify
   under-reporting of habitual energy intake in selected communities in
   Ghana, South Africa, Seychelles, Jamaica and the USA. Under-reporting of
   habitual energy intake was observed in all the five countries. The South
   African cohort exhibited the highest mean under-reporting (-52.1% of
   energy) compared with the cohorts of Ghana (-22.5 %), Jamaica (-17.9 %),
   Seychelles (-25.0 %) and the USA (-18.5 %). BMI was the most consistent
   predictor of underreporting compared with other predictors. In
   conclusion, there is substantial under-reporting of dietary energy
   intake in populations across the whole range of the HDI, and this
   systematic reporting error increases according to the BMI of an

AB The interaction of clouds and radiation is a particularly difficult
   issue in the study of climate change. Clouds have a large impact on the
   earth's radiation budget but the range of spatial and temporal scales
   and the complexity of the physical processes associated with clouds made
   these interactions difficult to simulate. The Department of Energy's
   Atmospheric Radiation Measurement (ARM) program was established to
   improve the understanding of the interaction of radiation with the
   atmosphere with a particular emphasis on the effects of clouds. To
   continue its role of providing data for the study of these interactions,
   the ARM program deployed an Atmospheric Radiation and Cloud Station
   (ARCS) in the tropical western Pacific. This site began operation in
   October 1996. The tropical western Pacific is a very important climatic
   region. It is characterized by strong solar heating, high water vapor
   concentrations, and active convection. The ARCS is equipped with a
   comprehensive suite of instruments for measuring surface radiation
   fluxes and properties of the atmospheric state and is intended to
   operate for the next 10 years. The ARCS is an integrated unit that
   includes a data management system, a site monitor and control system, an
   external communications system, redundant electrical power systems, and
   containers that provide shelter for the equipment as well as work space
   for site operators, technicians, and visiting scientists. The dataset
   the ARCS produces will be invaluable in studying issues related to
   clouds and radiation in the Tropics. The site is located in Manus
   Province, Papua New Guinea, at 2.060 degrees S, 147.425 degrees E, 300
   km north of the island of New Guinea. Two more ARCS are planned for
   deployment across the tropical Pacific.

AB The aim of this paper is to determine the recovery rate and other
   performance parameters using a numerical model. The results are
   presented for a two-stage seawater reverse osmosis desalination unit
   with spiral-wound modules. The model, which is based on the mass and
   momentum transport equations, takes into consideration the longitudinal
   variation of the velocity, the pressure and the salt concentration in
   the membrane modules. Data given by plant authorities reveal that the
   plant is currently operating at a recovery rate of 67.53%. This project
   has shown that for the Desalination Company of Trinidad and Tobago, the
   recovery rate currently achieved by the plant (67.53%) might not be the
   most economical. Slightly reducing the recovery rate drastically reduces
   the energy cost, resulting in an overall reduced cost per cubic meter of
   desalinated drinking water.

AB The 18 719-km(2) Ramu drainage basin has a water quality regime largely
   unaffected by mining operations. The Ramu River Communities believe that
   this may change over the coming months and years, and have initiated
   their own state-of-the-art monitoring of the main river. These
   observations have centred on high-frequency (10-minute) observations of
   turbidity and flow giving possibly the first such annual data at this
   sampling frequency on New Guinea Island. The first year of monitoring
   has demonstrated a marked seasonality in the delivery of suspended
   sediment from the 5866 km(2) Upper Ramu basin, with considerably more
   natural variability in response within the 6-month wet season. Were new
   mining operations to release fine sediment (contaminated with heavy
   metals) into the watercourses of the Upper Ramu, then such shifts in the
   sediment signal may be more identifiable within the dry season. With
   evidence of an increase in fine sediment load, the Ramu Communities
   would have a more robust case to request increased monitoring of heavy
   metal levels within the Ramu, and if necessary to request improvements
   to the erosion and drainage management of mine areas.

AB The Papuan region, comprising New Guinea and nearby islands, has a
   complex geological history that has fostered high levels of biodiversity
   and endemism. Unfortunately, much of this diversity remains
   undocumented. We examine the evolutionary relationships of the venomous
   snake genus Aspidomorphus (Elapidae: Hydrophiinae), a Papuan endemic,
   and document extensive cryptic lineage diversification. Between
   Aspidomorphus species we find 22.2-27.9% corrected cyt-b sequence
   divergence. Within species we find 17.7-23.7% maximum sequence
   divergence. These high levels of genetic divergence may have complicated
   previous phytogenetic studies, which have had difficulty placing
   Aspidomorphus within the subfamily Hydrophiinae. Compared to previous
   studies, we increase sampling within Hydrophiinae to include all
   currently recognized species of Aspidomorphus and increase species
   representation for the genera Demansia and Toxicocalamus. We confirm
   monophyly of Aspidomorphus and resolve placement of the genus utilizing
   a set of seven molecular markers (12S, 16S, cyt-b, ND4, c-mos, MyHC-2,
   and RAG-1); we find strong support for a sister-group relationship
   between Aspidomorphus and a Demansia/foxicocalamus preussi clade. We
   also use one mitochondrial (cyt-b) and one nuclear marker (SPTBN1) to
   document deep genetic divergence within all currently recognized species
   of Aspidomorphus and discuss the Solomon Island Arc as a potential
   center of divergence in this species. Lastly, we find high levels of
   concordance between the mtDNA and nuDNA markers used for inter-species
   phylogenetic reconstruction. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB We explore the factors that affect the development of renewable energy
   in the Caribbean. The Caribbean region can serve as a laboratory in
   studying the institutional issues relating to energy development due to
   the differences in political jurisdictions over a short distance. Based
   on 12 case studies and 75 in-depth interviews with a variety of
   stakeholders, we identified five factors that appear to be critical for
   the development of renewable energy in the Caribbean: entrepreneurship
   attitudes, the role of local champions, the electric utility influence,
   informal institutions and the influence of international agencies.
   We built a multiple regression model to test these relationships through
   a survey of 34 political jurisdictions in the Caribbean. The statistical
   analysis we conducted suggests that informal institutions have a
   significant impact on the extent of renewable energy development, while
   the incumbent electricity utilities' influence may impede the
   development of renewable energy.
   Based on these findings, we provide recommendations on how best to make
   use of these factors identified, in order to develop effective energy
   policies throughout the Caribbean. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

AB Focusing primarily, but not exclusively, on urban and periurban Papua
   New Guinea (PNG), we discuss the significance of instant ramen noodles
   to those now known as the "bottom of the pyramid" (BOP). Although
   instant noodles are remarkable in that they are eaten by virtually
   everyone in the world, albeit in different amounts and for different
   reasons, they are marketed in PNG specifically as a "popularly
   positioned product" (PPP) for the BOP. Cheap, convenient, tasty,
   filling, and shelf stable, they are a modern addition to Sidney Mintz's
   classic "proletarian hunger killers" of sugar, tea, and coffee. But, we
   argue, instant noodles have a distinctive contemporary role: they do
   more than sustain the poor; they transform them into the aspiring
   consumers of the BOP. As such, instant noodles can be viewed as an
   antifriction device, greasing the skids of capitalism as it extends its
   reach.

AB The Cretaceous succession in Jamaica can be divided into sedimentary
   packages bounded by major unconformities (synthems). On the base of
   biostratigraphy and ages derived from strontium isotope ratios, these
   unconformities have been dated as Early Santonian, Late Campanian-Early
   Maastrichtian and Early Eocene. Each unconformity is also characterised
   by the widespread deposition of shallow water limestones, and a further
   shallow limestone depositional event occurred in the late Middle
   Campanian. Some unconformities can be related to known tectonic events
   (based on either Burke-type or Pindell-type models) that affected the
   Caribbean region. The Early Santonian event is widespread and occurred
   shortly after the creation of the Caribbean Large Igneous Province. The
   late Middle Campanian shallow water limestone event could correlate to
   the reversal of the Great Arc of the Caribbean in Burke-type models, but
   is unrepresented in Pindell-type models. The Late Campanian-Early
   Maastrichtian unconformity is related to the first collision of the
   Caribbean Plate with North America in both Burke-type and Pindell-type
   models. The Early Eocene event is associated with the onset of rifting
   that controlled Tertiary depositional patterns across Jamaica.

AB Non-consumptive effects of predators can have important impacts on
   aquatic food webs, but there are few data on how predators change the
   behaviour of Caribbean reef fishes. Such changes may include behavioural
   responses to the invasive predatory lionfish (Pterois volitans/P.
   miles). This study used an aquarium experiment to examine the behaviour
   of herbivorous parrotfish (Scarus iseri) in the absence of other fish
   (control), with a non-piscivore present, and with a predatory threat
   from a native grouper or lionfish. Treatments were repeated with and
   without additional parrotfish shelters to examine the potential effects
   of degraded reefs (loss of refuges). Using video, parrotfish behaviours
   (sheltering, swimming in open areas, foraging, aggressive conspecific
   interactions, bite rates, and shoaling behaviour) were recorded for
   groups of four parrotfish. Compared to the control, the average number
   of parrotfish hiding was reduced by 65 % and foraging shoals were 10 %
   larger when threatened by grouper, likely as a specific response to an
   ambush predator. When exposed to lionfish, parrotfish reduced their bite
   rates by 50 %, possibly to be more vigilant of this predator's unique
   stalking behaviour. The absence of additional shelter had limited
   effects although parrotfish formed 10 % larger shoals when swimming in
   open water, potentially as a defensive behaviour because of a perceived
   lack of refuges. The reduction in parrotfish bite rates caused by
   lionfish may have important demographic consequences. Furthermore,
   parrotfishes are important grazers of macroalgae, and these behavioural
   changes may exacerbate the direct effects of lionfish predation and
   potentially affect reef benthic dynamics.

AB Parasitoid wasps are an extremely speciose, ecologically and
   economically crucial group of insects. Despite this, they have received
   disproportionally little attention from scientists, in particular in
   certain areas of the world. One such area is the Caribbean, where
   studies are scarce despite the importance of parasitoid wasps, and the
   uniqueness and diversity of the Caribbean islands. To verify whether an
   adequate diversity of parasitoid wasps at family level can be found to
   warrant future studies, this study carries out preliminary sampling in
   three localities in Jamaica. A total of 1522 individual parasitoid
   wasps, belonging to at least 16 different families collected during 16
   events provide preliminary evidence there is in fact a high diversity of
   parasitoid wasps in Jamaica, and that future studies there, as in the
   rest of the Caribbean are definitely worthwhile.

AB The 1994 eruption of Rabaul, in Papua New Guinea, involved a small
   plinian eruption at Vulcan and a vulcanian eruption on the opposite side
   of the caldera at Tavurvur. Vulcan's ash leachates indicate seawater
   interaction that is consistent with earlier observations of low sulfur
   dioxide emissions and the presence of ice crystals in the initial
   plinian eruption cloud. In contrast, Tavurvur ash leachates indicate no
   seawater interaction, and later sulfur dioxide emissions remained high
   despite low-level eruptive activity. Silicic melt inclusions indicate
   that the andesitic melt contained about 2 weight percent water and
   negligible carbon dioxide. Mafic melt inclusions in Tavurvur ash have
   water and carbon dioxide contents that vary systematically over the
   course of the eruption. The mafic melt inclusions suggest that a mafic
   dike intruded from below the silicic chamber and provide further
   evidence that mafic intrusions drive caldera unrest.

AB Marine protected areas (MPAs), including no-take marine reserves (MRs),
   play an important role in the conservation of marine biodiversity. We
   document the status of MPAs and MRs in Latin America and the Caribbean,
   where little has been reported on the scope of such protection. Our
   survey of protected area databases, published and unpublished
   literature, and Internet searches yielded information from 30 countries
   and 12 overseas territories. At present more than 700 MPAs have been
   established, covering more than 300,000 km(2) or 1.5% of the coastal and
   shelf waters. We report on the status of 3 categories of protection:
   MPAs (limited take throughout the area), MRs (no-take throughout the
   area), and mixed-use (a limited-take MPA that contains an MR). The
   majority of protected areas in Latin America and the Caribbean are MPAs,
   which allow some or extensive extractive activities throughout the
   designated area. These 571 sites cover 51,505 km(2) or 0.3% of coastal
   and shelf waters. There are 98 MRs covering 16,862 km(2) or 0.1% of the
   coastal and shelf waters. Mixed-use MPAs are the fewest in number (87),
   but cover the largest area (236,853 km(2), 1.2%). Across Latin America
   and the Caribbean, many biogeographic provinces are underrepresented in
   these protected areas. Large coastal regions remain unprotected, in
   particular, the southern Pacific and southern Atlantic coasts of South
   America. Our analysis reveals multiple opportunities to strengthen
   marine conservation in Latin America and the Caribbean by improving
   implementation, management, and enforcement of existing MPAs; adding new
   MPAs and MRs strategically to enhance connectivity and sustainability of
   existing protection; and establishing new networks of MPAs and MRs or
   combinations thereof to enhance protection where little currently
   exists.

AB Aim This analysis of moth (Lepidoptera) communities colonizing an alien
   tree invading secondary rain forest vegetation in Melanesia examines the
   predictability of insect herbivorous communities across distances of
   tens to thousands of km and the effect of dispersal barriers on
   community composition in the tropics.
   Location Six secondary rain forest sites were studied within four
   equidistant yet distinct geographic areas of the New Guinea mainland and
   the Bismarck Archipelago, including two watershed areas (Madang and
   Sepik) on mainland New Guinea and the adjacent large island of New
   Britain and small island of Unea.
   Methods The analysis is based on feeding records obtained by
   quantitative sampling and rearing of caterpillars from the alien host
   Spathodea campanulata (Bignoniaceae). It examines the variation in
   Lepidoptera community composition at six study sites distributed on
   three adjacent islands ranging in size from 30 to 865,000 km(2).
   Results Spathodea campanulata was colonized by 54 folivorous species of
   Lepidoptera. Most of them were generalists, feeding on > 1 native plant
   family. However, the three most abundant species representing 83% of all
   individuals (Acherontia lachesis, Hyblaea puera complex and Psilogramma
   menephron) were relatively host specific, feeding predominantly on a
   single native family that is not the Bignoniaceae. Most of the 23
   species analysed in detail had a wide geographic distribution, including
   13 species spanning the entire 1000-km study transect. While the
   Lepidoptera in two New Guinea areas 280 km apart were similar to each
   other, there was a discontinuity in species composition between New
   Guinea and the smaller islands. However, no negative effect of small
   islands on species richness was detected.
   Main conclusions Spathodea campanulata was rapidly colonized by
   folivorous Lepidoptera communities with species richness and dominance
   structure indistinguishable from the assemblages feeding on native
   hosts, despite its phylogenetic isolation from the native vegetation.
   Although most species were generalists, the highest population densities
   were reached by relatively specialized species, similar to the
   communities on native hosts. The species turnover across distances from
   10 to 1000 km was relatively low as most of the species had wide
   geographic ranges.

AB Marine crustaceans are a well-known invertebrates group in Cuban waters,
   but some taxa are not well catalogued and the literature about them is
   scattered. In this work, we present the checklist of porcelain crabs of
   Cuban Archipelago, including the literature registers and unpublished
   author's data. A key to the identification of 8 genera and 23 species of
   the Cuban porcelain crabs is provided. Information about the local
   distribution of species is presented. In addition, we analyzed the
   porcelain crab faunal affinities between the ecoregions of the Cuban
   platform, Greater Antilles islands and the Tropical Northwestern
   Atlantic (TNA) province. For the first time, we record the presence of
   the monotypic genus Parapetrolisthes Haig in Cuba. On the Cuban
   platform, the highest similarities are between the Southcentral and
   Northwestern ecoregions (50%) and between Northcentral and Northeastern
   (40%). In the Greater Antilles, Cuba and Puerto Rico are the most
   similar (54%), but in general, the porcelain crab composition shows a
   high variation (e.g. 19% between Hispaniola and Puerto Rico). In the
   Tropical Northwestern Atlantic, five homogeneous groups of porcelain
   crab species are distinguished. Cuban fauna is most similar to that of
   Floridian, Western Caribbean and Southern Gulf of Mexico ecoregions. The
   decrease in species richness is evident from south to north in the TNA
   Province.

AB There is considerable variation in cannibalism between different species
   and also between individuals of different species, although relatively
   little is known about what creates this variation. We investigated the
   degree of cannibalism in guppy (Poecilia reticulata) populations
   originating from high and low predation environments in Trinidad, and
   also how cannibalism was affected by the presence of refuges. Females
   from two populations were allowed to feed on juveniles from two
   populations in aquaria trials. The cannibalism was size-dependent and
   varied depending on both juvenile and female origin. Low predation
   females were more efficient cannibals and low predation juveniles were
   better at avoiding cannibalism compared to high predation guppies when
   no refuges were present. The high predation females were superior
   cannibals and the high predation juveniles were better at escaping
   cannibalism than the low predation guppies when refuges were present. We
   discuss whether the differences in cannibalism and response to refuge
   addition relate to predation-induced habitat shifts and differences in
   the guppies' natural environment.

AB We employ a battery of 33 polymorphic microsatellite loci to describe
   geographical population structure of the mangrove killifish
   (Kryptolebias marmoratus), the only vertebrate species known to have a
   mixed-mating system of selfing and outcrossing. Significant population
   genetic structure was detected at spatial scales ranging from tens to
   hundreds of kilometres in Florida, Belize, and the Bahamas. The wealth
   of genotypic information, coupled with the highly inbred nature of most
   killifish lineages due to predominant selfing, also permitted treatments
   of individual fish as units of analysis. Genetic clustering algorithms,
   neighbour-joining trees, factorial correspondence, and related methods
   all earmarked particular killifish specimens as products of recent
   outcross events that could often be provisionally linked to specific
   migration events. Although mutation is the ultimate source of genetic
   diversity in K. marmoratus, our data indicate that interlocality
   dispersal and outcross-mediated genetic recombination (and probably
   genetic drift also) play key proximate roles in the local 'clonal'
   dynamics of this species.

AB The Anthropocene is linked to massive land use changes as a result of

   documented, the effects on belowground microbial communities are less
   understood, yet could impact on many ecosystem functions. Here we aimed
   to identify differences in belowground microbial diversity between
   forest and grassland sites in a humid tropical mosaic landscape in Papua
   New Guinea. Using DNA-based amplicon sequencing targeting the 16S rRNA
   gene, prokaryotic community composition was assessed from surface soil
   samples. The composition of prokaryotic communities (beta diversity)
   differed between forest and grassland sites despite maintaining similar
   richness (alpha diversity) levels. Changes in community structure were
   small at higher taxonomic levels, but strong at the operational
   taxonomic unit (OTU) level but for a small subset of taxa. Changes in
   community composition between sites (based on Bray-Curtis distance)
   reflected a large rearrangement with species assemblage (OTU) differing
   by 68%. The results suggest that ecosystem change in this landscape
   leads to ecological filtering and selection at lower, but not higher
   taxonomic levels.

AB The need for a global priority list for threatened plants has been
   widely recognized by the conservation community, yet the threatened
   status of the majority of the world's plants species remains poorly
   known. This is especially true in the tropics and the oceanic islands of
   the Pacific, where progress towards the targets of the Global Strategy
   for Plant Conservation (GSPC) 2011-2020 is hindered by the paucity of
   complete species distribution data. Here we outline a new methodology to
   undertake threatened species assessments where detailed contemporary
   population data is lacking. This new interdisciplinary methodology draws
   upon the synthesis of archaeological and botanical data to calculate a
   percentage of long-term decline in habitat quality. We use this method
   to assess the threatened status of the endemic flora of Palau,
   Micronesia, a Pacific island nation known for its high levels of plant
   diversity and endemism, by utilizing data extending back to human
   colonization of the archipelago. For Palau, we calculate the percentage
   of a long-term decline in habitat quality to be 31-39% of the total
   available range of 55% of the endemic plant species. These data are also
   used to address a long debated question in the western Pacific: Are the
   origins of the savanna vegetation anthropogenic? Strong evidence for
   anthropogenic savannas in Micronesia support the estimated extent of
   historic deforestation in Palau. This new method worked well in our case
   study, and can be used in other locations with incomplete species
   distribution data to establish a first basis for conservation
   prioritization. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Do changes in food resources lead to evolutionary changes in phenotypic
   plasticity or in different constant phenotypes? I addressed this
   question by studying plasticity of larval feeding arms for "geminate
   species pairs" in three echinoid genera. These closely related species
   were geographically isolated when the Panamanian Isthmus raised 2.8-3.1
   million years ago, creating two different food level environments: high
   but variable food levels in the eastern Pacific versus chronically low
   food levels in the western Caribbean. I reared larvae of geminate
   species in different replicated food environments for 10 days
   postfertilization, collected morphological measurements of individual
   arm and body lengths, and calculated degrees of plasticity of relative
   arm length for each species. In contrast to previous studies with
   temperate echinoids, there was no significant plasticity of arm length
   in either the Pacific or Caribbean species considered here. Caribbean
   species, however, had significantly longer relative arm lengths than
   Pacific species, regardless of food levels. These results suggest that
   historical changes in food levels have led to the evolution of constant
   rather than plastic differences between Pacific and Caribbean echinoids.
   The evolution of plasticity may be limited by the timing of reproduction
   or by egg size in this system.

AB The concentrations of Po-210 and Pb-210 have been determined in many
   local foods consumed by societies residing on different atolls in the
   Marshall Islands. The average daily intake of these two naturally
   occurring radionuclides from local and imported food is estimated to be
   2.18 and 0.36 Bq, respectively. Local foods contribute 87% of the Po-210
   and 47% of the Pb-210 associated with the diet. The items contributing
   the majority of the activity to the diet are derived from the marine
   environment and include parts of fish, invertebrates, seabirds and eggs
   of seabirds. The committed effective dose from ingestion of Po-210 and
   Pb-210 is approximately 2 mSv/year (200 mrem/year). This pathway now
   contributes 83% of the natural background irradiation received by
   residents in the Marshall Islands. Because the naturally occurring
   radionuclides are omnipresent in terrestrial and marine foods at all
   atolls, the annual intake and computed dose can be considered as typical
   values for individuals with comparable diets and inhabiting other
   islands in the Pacific.

   Distributed through tropics and subtropics in Indo-Pacific and
   Caribbean, extending into temperate zones in Atlantic, Indian, and North
   Pacific Oceans. In western Palearctic, found mainly in UK, Ireland,
   France, and Azores. Population size 814 pairs in Britain and Ireland, c.
   100 in France, and c. 1000 in Azores. Experienced a large population
   decline in Britain and Ireland from 3000 pairs in the 1960s to 472 pairs
   in 1984: now recovering mainly due to growth of single colony in Co.
   Dublin, Ireland. Subject to intense conservation work in breeding range,
   including legal protection, management of nesting habitat, prevention of
   disturbance, and control and exclusion of predators. Education work in
   Ghana also conducted to reduce incidence of trapping by children.
   Survival of adults relatively low: between 75 and 85%; first-year
   survival rates between 30 and 50%. Low survival rates probably explain
   population decline. Migratory, western Palearctic birds move along East
   Atlantic seaboard to winter in West Africa, especially Ghana. Some
   Azores birds migrate to Brazil and winter with Caribbean population.
   Specialized forager, feeding on relatively narrow range of small
   epipelagic fish species in Britain and Ireland, though wider range of
   prey including deep-water fish taken in Azores. Breeding success high in
   Britain, Ireland, and USA owing to selection of high-quality breeding
   locations and conservation management. Failure generally associated with
   poor food availability and predation, rarely flooding. Will move
   colonies in response to breeding failures or habitat loss, and this
   explains variations in distribution in north-west Europe. For reviews of
   Roseate Tern biology beyond western Palearctic, see Gochfeld et al.

   and to increase those due to diseases of excessive food consumption,
   which are affecting adults and a growing number of children.
   This article reviews the main dietary factors which have an influence on
   cardiovascular disease and cancer, and discusses the link between
   economic development and increased rates of chronic diseases. There is
   evidence that the noncommunicable diseases and their risk factors have
   risen rapidly in countries of the WHO Western Pacific Region. Data from
   29 countries and areas in the region indicate that 70% of them show
   lifestyle diseases in three or more of the top five causes of death.
   While public health measures have been implemented by some countries to
   prevent and control nutrition-related chronic diseases, further action
   is needed.

AB Habitat maps are frequently invoked as surrogates of biodiversity to aid
   the design of networks of marine reserves. Maps are used to maximize
   habitat heterogeneity in reserves because this is likely to maximize the
   number of species protected. However, the technique's efficacy is
   limited by intra-habitat variability in the species present and their
   abundances. Although communities are expected to vary among patches of
   the same habitat, this variability is poorly documented and rarely
   incorporated into reserve planning. To examine intra-habitat variability
   in coral-reef fishes, we generated a data set from eight tropical
   coastal habitats and six islands in the Bahamian archipelago using
   underwater visual censuses. Firstly, we provide further support for
   habitat heterogeneity as a surrogate of biodiversity as each predefined
   habitat type supported a distinct assemblage of fishes. Intrahabitat
   variability in fish community structure at scales of hundreds of
   kilometers (among islands) was significant in at least 75% of the
   habitats studied, depending on whether presence/absence, density, or
   biomass data were used. Intra-habitat variability was positively
   correlated with the mean number of species in that habitat when density
   and biomass data were used. Such relationships provide a proxy for the
   assessment of intra-habitat variability when detailed quantitative data
   are scarce. Intra-habitat variability was examined in more detail for
   one habitat (forereefs visually dominated by Montastraea corals).
   Variability in community structure among islands was driven by small,
   demersal families (e. g., territorial pomacentrid and labrid fishes).
   Finally, we examined the ecological and economic significance of
   intra-habitat variability in fish assemblages on Montastraea reefs by
   identifying how this variability affects the composition and abundances
   of fishes in different functional groups, the key ecosystem process of
   parrotfish grazing, and the ecosystem service of value of commercially
   important finfish. There were significant differences in a range of
   functional groups and grazing, but not fisheries value. Variability at
   the scale of tens of kilometers (among reefs around an island) was less
   than that among islands. Caribbean marine reserves should be replicated
   at scales of hundreds of kilometers, particularly for species-rich
   habitats, to capture important intra-habitat variability in community
   structure, function, and an ecosystem process.

AB The water resources of the atolls of the Republic of the Maldives are
   under continual threat from climatic and anthropogenic stresses, such as
   changing rainfall patterns, sea-level rise, and contamination from human
   activities and climatic events. Groundwater, a historically important
   resource of the island communities of the Maldives, is particularly
   affected due to the fragile nature of the freshwater lens on small atoll
   islands. In this study the dynamics of the freshwater lens are simulated
   during an extended (19982011) time period to determine the fluctuation
   of lens thickness of islands of the Maldives in response to annual and
   long-term changes in rainfall. Particularly, maximum and minimum lens
   thickness during the simulation period are assessed, as well as the
   occurrence of general trends, either decreasing or increasing, in lens
   thickness. Simulations are performed for a variety of island sizes,
   corresponding to the range of sizes of the islands of the Maldives, and
   for the various climatic regions of the Maldives. Results indicate that
   many of the atoll islands are expected to have a measurable freshwater
   lens during the majority of a long-term climatic period, although
   significant decreases in thickness can occur during the months of the
   dry season, with complete depletion occurring for small islands. Of
   particular note is the observation of a general decrease in lens
   thickness, approximately 2-4 cm/yr, over the 14-year period for the
   northern regions of the Maldives. If continued at current rates, these
   trends can have a significant impact on groundwater resources for the
   Maldives. Results imply that fresh groundwater, if properly protected
   from land surface-derived contamination and over-pumping and associated
   salinization, can be a valuable source of water for the Maldives,
   particularly for the larger islands. Overall, results provide water
   resource managers and government officials with valuable data for
   consideration in water security measures. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All

   have become transposed on the growing paradigm shift towards green
   economy pathways. Central to this is the challenge of implementing
   Caribbean energy policy in a manner that is aligned with green economy
   ideals and face the realities of regional indebtedness and environmental
   impacts. Here we analyze the current state of the Caribbean energy
   policy development arena and propose that the currently weak policy and
   institutional design regime might potentially benefit from the
   application of the Institutional Analysis and Design (IAD) model
   especially within the operational context of the green economy. It
   allows us to identify current policy dilemmas, bottlenecks and
   discrepancies and to disentangle some of them while offering up a way
   forward with others. We do not so much offer distinct recommendations
   but focus more on delineating how to clear the pathway for sound policy
   intervention and outcomes. By doing so we set forth a challenging agenda
   for future policy analysis research that will advance Caribbean energy
   policy in more robust ways. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Anthropometric data from the 1982/83 Papua New Guinea (PNG) National
   Nutrition Survey were analysed to identify geographical patterns of
   child growth and investigate their relation to a wide range of
   environmental, dietary and socio-economic variables. Standardized growth
   scores for length-for-age (LAZ), weight-for-age (WAZ) and
   weight-for-length (WLZ) were calculated based on an internal PNG growth
   reference. Hierarchical Bayesian spatial models based on conditional
   autoregressive (CAR) priors were subsequently used to model spatial
   patterns in scores and their relation to different sets of covariates.
   The geographical differences were bigger for linear growth than for
   increases in weight. Growth was most reduced in parts of Milne Bay
   Province, Madang Province, the Torricelli/Prinz Alexander Ranges, and in
   the area occupied by Angan people. Socio-economic status was the most
   important factor determining variation in growth within populations.
   Differences in diet and, to a lesser extent, the physical environment
   were the main determining factor of differences among populations.
   Covariate adjustment accounted for more spatially structured variation
   in LAZ and WAZ than in WLZ. All variables indicating higher
   socio-economic status were correlated with better growth, as was a high
   consumption of imported and local high quality foods such as cereals,
   legumes, tinned fish/meat or fresh fish. This indicates that nutritional
   interventions in PNG should aim at promoting the consumption of such
   high energy and high protein foods as well as strengthening the general
   economic base of rural populations.

   opening of Drake Passage and the closing of the Tethys Seaway,
   reorganized the global ocean currents to induce a reversal of the volume
   transport between Atlantic and Pacific. This flow reversal, which is
   timed near the Oligocene-Miocene boundary, allowed cool Pacific waters
   to enter the Caribbean Sea possibly affecting the habitat of warm water

AB Western Atlantic tonguefishes of the Symphurus plagusia (Schneider, in

   Symphurus species by the possession of 12 caudal fin rays, a 1-4-3
   pattern of interdigitation of dorsal-fin pterygiophores and neural
   spines, absence of a pupillary operculum, reduced or absent dentition on
   ocular-side jaws, and an unpigmented peritoneum.  Considerable taxonomic
   uncertainty has been associated with nominal species of this complex,
   but the most common practice has been to recognize one widespread
   species (S. plagusia) with two subspecies ranging from the Caribbean
   southward to Uruguay, and a second species, S. civitatium Ginsburg 1951,
   occurring in inshore areas along the southeastern and Gulf of Mexico
   coasts of the United States and northern Mexico.  The validity of S.
   civitatium is confirmed in this study.  Examination of tonguefishes from
   the Caribbean and southward indicates that specimens previously
   identified as S. plagusia do not comprise one species with two
   allopatric subspecies, but rather four largely sympatric, albeit not
   necessarily syntopic, species.  Symphurus plagusia, the first described
   species in this complex, occurs in inshore habitats ranging from the
   Caribbean to Rio de Janeiro.  Symphurus tessellatus (Quoy and Gaimard
   1824), removed from the synonymy of S. plagusia, occurs in nearshore,
   estuarine, and neritic waters throughout the Caribbean southwards to
   Uruguay.  Two new species, S. oculellus occurring in neritic waters off
   northern South America (Guyana to northern Brazil), and S. caribbeanus
   (nearshore habitats throughout the Caribbean), are described and
   figured.  A key to the western Atlantic species of this complex is

   domain, north of Jamaica, related to a left-lateral fault zone.
   Transpressive deformation of the southern tip of Beata Ridge suggests
   compressional intra-plate deformation of the Caribbean volcanic plateau.

AB National forest inventories (NFIs) have to be properly designed in order
   to yield statistically representative data and make best use of limited
   resources. A key element to accomplish this is the knowledge of the
   local variability in the sampled forest stand features. In this study,
   we estimated the variability of tree taxonomic richness and carbon (C)
   stock in logged-over and unlogged lowland tropical forests of Papua New
   Guinea, to define the optimal plot and sample size needed to estimate
   these characteristics in the context of the forthcoming implementation
   of the new NFI. We used data from 133 one-hectare permanent sample plots
   to calculate the coefficient of variation (CV) of C stock and taxonomic
   richness at different simulated plot sizes. CV was seen to rapidly
   decrease with increasing plot size up to 0.2-0.3 ha for both features
   following an inverse-exponential trend. Optimum plot size ranged between
   0.08 and 0.32 ha, with 75-164 plots needed to achieve an estimation
   within 5 per cent of the true mean (95 per cent confidence), depending
   on the stand feature and the previous silvicultural treatment. We
   concluded that the establishment of a network of 319 permanent sample
   plots between 0.2 and 0.3 ha in size would represent an efficient
   sampling scheme in lowland forests for the new NFI.

AB . We use a high-resolution numerical model to analyze the hydrodynamical
   exchange processes of the Cienfuegos Bay with the Caribbean Sea. Results
   show that freshwater inputs and wind are the main factors controlling
   the water exchange in the bay. Nine simulation case studies with three
   wind conditions and three freshwater inputs were carried out. The main
   conclusion is that the Cienfuegos Bay system has a slow exchange rate,
   with an average flushing time of 39 days during the rainy period and 50
   days during the dry one, for the most probable wind direction. Two new
   temporary scales for Cienfuegos Bay are discussed: the local e-flushing
   time and the flushing lag. The results obtained for these new variables
   validate the slow exchange capacity of the bay.

AB Subsistence systems in insular Southeast Asia and the western Pacific
   are geographically patterned: from west to east, grain crops disappear
   while root and tree crops become more important, and south of the Torres
   Strait no crops are grown. Previous explanations for these patterns have
   assumed either a historical cause ( the expansion of root and tree crops
   before grain crops) or some form of environmental filter. Paralleling
   the agricultural pattern is a west-to-east pattern of increasing
   variability in interannual rainfall variation. I propose that this
   variability limited the utility of annual crops and increased reliance
   on long-lived plants whose food production averages across longer
   periods. The range of human responses to these difficult conditions is
   illustrated by discussion of the anomalies represented by the unique
   qualities of the agricultural regimes of Botel Tobago and eastern
   Melanesia and by the distribution of crops and subsistence systems
   across the Torres Strait.

AB Purpose - This study sets out to assess public awareness and perception
   of genetically modified (GM) foods in Trinidad, West Indies.
   Design/methodology/approach - Respondents (113) were interviewed by
   structured questionnaire on demographics, awareness, perceived risks,
   perceived benefits, labelling, availability of GM foods and
   responsibility for information.
   Findings - Some respondents (31.0 per cent) had not heard of GM foods.
   Most (64.6 per cent) respondents were willing ("very" or "somewhat") to
   purchase GM foods, if considered healthier than conventionally-produced
   foods or to purchase GM foods if they were safe (47.8 per cent). Food
   labels were important for warnings (31.4 per cent), information (30.4
   per cent) and advertising (15.3 per cent). Some major perceived risks of
   GM foods were the toxic effects on health (41.6 per cent) and allergenic
   effects (28.3 per cent). Some benefits of GM were for increased
   productivity of crops and food availability (43.8 per cent), improved
   health and in disease control (27.9 per cent), economics (21 per cent),
   pest resistance (18.8 per cent) and improved nutrition (16 per cent).
   Most respondents (41.1 per cent) felt that the Government was
   responsible for giving information on GM foods. The public was
   indifferent (p > 0.05) as to whether GM foods should be grown in
   Trinidad and Tobago. The level of education and gender were not (p >
   0.05) influential factors on responses.
   Originahty/value - Although the sample size was small, the findings
   could be used to target effective public education and bio-safety
   policies.

   transitional events along a tide-dominated shoreline, and expands
   reconstructive detail for the wider southern PNG lowlands. Coinciding
   with recent regional archaeological research, this study also holds
   implications for interpretations of the Holocene settlement of Caution
   Bay and long-term people-landscape interactions. Data demonstrate a
   late-Holocene mangrove to mudflat transition, with vegetation patterns
   largely a function of low sediment loading, sedimentary redistributions
   and salinisation upon sea level decline c. 2000 cal. yr BP. These trends
   appear unique to Caution Bay, highlighting a variety of Holocene
   shoreline vegetation changes along the PNG south coast, each dependent
   on geomorphologic setting and hydrological fluxes. Further work is
   required to elucidate vegetation change inland of the coastal zone.
   Greater understanding of burning patterns and an archaeological
   collaboration are required to determine more concisely dryland plant
   spatial and temporal variability.

AB Purpose. To document the challenge to providing adequate resources for
   the clinical teaching of Food Animal Medicine at the School of
   Veterinary Medicine (SVM) on a small island in a developing region,
   while adopting new teaching methodologies for effective veterinary
   education.
   Method. The history of the development of the Food Animal Ambulatory and
   Theriogenology Clinical Rotation (FAATCR) in a newly established DVM
   program has been highlighted as it evolved at the Faculty of Medical
   Sciences, University of the West Indies, Trinidad campus. Student
   evaluation of their experiences on this rotation has pointed to
   strengths and weaknesses in the teaching and learning process.
   Results. There was evidence of the need for Time Management of schedules
   within the FAATCR at well as indications of FAATCR's inability to
   provide clinical experiences and clinical competency training in certain
   components of Food animal medicine. It was found that students had not
   been exposed to the full range of educational methodology expected
   during the rotation. In addition, there was evidence that although a
   number of identifiable clinical skills were acquired by the students,
   the anticipated level to which theory would be integrated with practice
   was not attained during the FAATCR.
   Conclusion. As a result of the review of student concerns and the
   performance appraisal of the FAATCR, recommendations on infrastructural
   changes have been identified. In addition, new courses and approaches
   have been suggested as complements to the current veterinary education
   curriculum at the SVM.

AB INTRODUCTION: An increasingly popular strategy to improving the food
   retail environment and promoting healthy eating in low-income and
   minority communities is the corner store conversion. This approach
   involves partnering with small 'corner' food stores to expand access to
   high-quality fruits, vegetables, and other healthy foods.
   METHODS: We conducted a structured review of the literature to assess
   inventories and sales in corner stores, as well as to identify
   intervention strategies employed by corner store conversions.
   RESULTS: Our review returned eight descriptive studies that discussed
   corner store inventories and sales, as well as ten intervention studies
   discussing six unique corner store conversion interventions in the
   United States, the Marshall Islands, and Canada. Common intervention
   strategies included: 1) partnering with an existing store, 2) stocking
   healthy foods, and 3) social marketing and nutrition education. We
   summarize each strategy and review the effectiveness of overall corner
   store conversions at changing peoples' food purchasing, preparation, and
   consumption behaviors.
   CONCLUSIONS: Consumption of fresh, healthy, affordable foods could be
   improved by supporting existing retailers to expand their selection of
   healthy foods and promoting healthy eating at the neighborhood level.
   Additional corner store conversions should be conducted to determine the
   effectiveness and importance of specific intervention strategies.

   dorsal-fin rays VI+I, 10-12, the spines slender, none filamentous;
   anal-fin rays 1,11-12; pectoral-fin rays 14-19, none free of membrane;
   pelvic disc with a frenum; scales on body largely ctenoid, 28-31 in
   longitudinal series; gill-rakers short, 1 + 3-4; anterior interorbital
   pores 2; sensory papillae on cheek primarily in a pattern of 4 or 5
   vertical rows; body moderately elongate, the depth 3.8-5.4 in SL; head
   and body compressed; dorsal profile of head initially near-vertical,
   often with a slight anterior protuberance above upper lip; lower lip
   with a ventral flap on side of jaw; mouth inferior, the gape slightly
   oblique; teeth anteriorly in jaws in several rows, the outer row in
   upper jaw as slender well spaced canines (outer row of teeth at front of
   lower jaw may or may not be caniniform); tongue bilobed; gill opening
   ending slightly below level of lower edge of pectoral-fin base; caudal
   fin rounded, usually longer than head; a dark line extending ventrally
   from eye, sometimes with one or more side branches. Of the 2 nominal
   Indo-Pacific species that have been described in Gnatholepis, only 5 are
   recognised as valid. G. anjerensis (Bleeker), for which a neotype is
   described, occurs from East Africa and the Red Sea to the Hawaiian
   Islands and French Polynesia [synonyms include G. deltoides (Seale), G.
   knighti Jordan and Evermann, and G. corlettei (Herre)]. G. cauerensis
   (Bleeker) is provisionally divided into 4 subspecies, mainly by modal
   differences in pectoral-ray counts and slight colour variation: G.
   cauerensis cauerensis from East Africa to the Society Islands (G.
   scapulostigma Herre and G. inconsequens Whitley are synonyms); G. c.
   australis from Rarotonga, Cook Islands to the Pitcairn Islands; G. c.
   hawaiiensis from the Hawaiian Islands; and G. c. pascuensisfron at
   Easter Island. G. davaoensis Seale, also provided with a neotype and
   description, ranges from the Ryukyu fislands to the Solomon Islands,
   Papua New Guinea, and Indonesia (G. gemmus Herre is a synonym). G.
   gymnocara, n. sp., is described from 26 specimens from shallow water of
   Queensland and the Northern Territory, Australia; it is unique in having
   12 anal-fin soft-rays, prepectoral scales, no scales on cheek and
   opercle, median predorsal zone naked or with only a few small scales
   across its anterior part, and a large black spot on fourth interspinous
   membrane of dorsal fin in males. Gnatholepis sp., also a new species
   from northern Australia will be described by Helen K. Larson; it is
   distinct in having 10 dorsal soft-rays, 15-17 pectoral-fin rays, nof
   scales on cheek, opercle, median predorsal zone, or prepectoral area;
   and the last 2 to 4 mid-lateral blotches of the male dark brown to
   black. The count of pectoral-fin rays is the most useful meristic
   character to separate die species and subspecies of Gnatholepis: G.
   anjerensis is, with 14-17 rays, has a strongly modal count of 16; G.
   cauerensis cauerensis and G. c. hawaiiensis have 16-19 rays (strongly
   modal 17); G. c. australis has 17-19 rays (modally 18); G. c. pascuensis
   has 18 or 19 rays, modally 19; G. davacensis has 15-17 rays, modally 17.

   that 70% of the Bikini Atoll zooxanthellate coral assemblage is
   resilient to large-scale anthropogenic disturbance. Species composition
   in 2002 was assessed and compared to that seen prior to nuclear testing.
   A total of 183 scleractinian coral species was recorded, compared to 126
   species recorded in the previous study (excluding synonomies, 148
   including synonomies). We found that 42 coral species may be locally
   extinct at Bikini. Fourteen of these losses may be pseudo-losses due to
   inconsistent taxonomy between the two studies or insufficient sampling
   in the second study, however 28 species appear to represent genuine
   losses. Of these losses, 16 species are obligate lagoonal specialists
   and 12 have wider habitat compatibility. Twelve species are recorded
   from Bikini for the first time. We suggest the highly diverse Rongelap
   Atoll to the east of Bikini may have contributed larval propagules to
   facilitate the partial resilience of coral biodiversity in the absence
   of additional anthropogenic threats. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

   turtle Carettochelys insculpta and the southern New Guinea soft-shelled
   turtle Pelochelys bibroni are riverine species. The New Guinea spotted
   turtle Elseya novaeguineae lives primarily in the tidal freshwater
   creeks and streams, flooded sinkholes and swamps of the lowland
   rainforest. The New Guinea painted turtle Emydura subglobosa resides
   almost exclusively in forest sinkholes and swamps. Pelochelys bibroni
   was the least-common species, and is probably locally endangered.
   Greatest turtle diversity occurred in the Karst Plains of the Kikori
   sub-basin, where there is a greater diversity of habitat available to
   turtles. Lowest diversity occurred in the highlands, where turtles were
   present in very low density as introduced populations, brought in from
   the Kikori lowlands, Mount Bosavi and the Western Province by visiting
   relatives. Linguistic diversity concurred with turtle diversity of the
   regions in which the languages were spoken. C. insculpta nests both on
   riverine sand beaches and on coastal beaches, sand spits and isolated
   sand bars where the Kikori River discharges into the Gulf of Papua.
   Adult females and eggs of C. insculpta are harvested heavily by local
   people for local consumption.

AB Pulley Ridge, a limestone ridge that extends nearly 300 km along the
   southwestern Florida shelf in the eastern Gulf of Mexico, supports a
   mesophotic coral ecosystem (59 to 94 m deep), surrounded by deeper
   waters. An ongoing evaluation of Porifera biodiversity observed and
   collected during expeditions by Harbor Branch Oceanographic Institute
   (2003-2015) have shown the existence of approximately 102 sponge
   species, with at least 20 species new to science. The present paper
   describes two novel Poecilosclerida from mesophotic reefs and deep
   escarpments in the Pulley Ridge Region, Eastern Gulf of Mexico, namely
   Discorhabdella ruetzleri n.sp. (Crambeidae, Poecilosclerida) and
   Hymedesmia (Hymedesmia) vaceleti n. sp. (Hymedesmiidae,
   Poecilosclerida). This is the first record of Discorhabdella for the
   greater Caribbean and the Central West Atlantic. The skeleton of D.
   ruetzleri n.sp. includes the unique pseudoastrose acanthostyles of the
   genus, and it is distinct from congeners in the size ranges of the
   megascleres and in the occurrence of predominantly smooth instead of
   tuberose choanosomal and ectosomal subtylostyles. The intense blue color
   and the spicule combination of Hymesdesmia (H.) vaceleti n.sp. makes
   this species unique among other Hymedesmia spp. from the western
   Atlantic. The discovery represents a considerable expansion in the known
   biogeographical distribution of the genus Discorhabdella which is
   represented now by six species with a discrete geographic distribution
   (New Zealand, Azores, Western Mediterranean Sea, Eastern Pacific in
   Panama). This work is the first contribution to an ongoing effort to
   discover and document the importance of sponge biodiversity on
   mesophotic reefs and associated deep-water habitats in the Gulf of
   Mexico and the Caribbean.

AB A major component of the "Our Planet Reviewed - Papua New Guinea"
   project was to evaluate insect diversity along an elevational gradient
   on Mt. Wilhelm (Madang Province, Papua New Guinea), the fourth highest
   peak in New Guinea. Flight intercept traps were installed at eight sites
   separated by approximately 500 m in elevation from 200 m a.s.l. to 3700
   m a.s.l. Here we focus on the water scavenger beetle genus Cetiocyon
   (Coleoptera: Hydrophilidae) collected as part of this project. Cetiocyon
   species are uniform in much of their external morphology, but diagnostic
   characters are found in the male genitalia. Our aim was to test the
   hypothesis that local species diversity was high, and that Cetiocyon
   species diversity is elevationally structured. A small amount of
   additional material from western New Guinea (Bird's Head Peninsula:
   Arfak Mts.) was also examined. Ten new species are described, seven from
   Mt. Wilhelm Cetiocyon paweli sp.n., C. depilis sp.n., C. onyx sp.n., C.
   augai sp.n., C. ibiscanus sp.n., C. mogianus sp.n., and C. gemellus
   sp.n., and three from the Arfak Mountains: C. jakli sp.n., C. colossus
   sp.n., and C. hamifer sp.n.. Twelve Cetiocyon species were found on the
   slopes of Mt. Wilhelm, most of which were only found at one or two
   neighboring elevations. The largest diversity of species was found at
   intermediate elevations (1200-1700 m). We successfully sequenced the 3'
   end of mitochondrial cox/ gene for 10 species, which we used along with
   morphological characteristics to infer a species level phylogeny and
   examine the effect of elevation on species diversity. Interspecific
   genetic distances were significantly lower at higher elevations on Mt.
   Wilhelm, and our phylogenetic reconstruction suggests that Cetiocyon
   ancestrally inhabited low or intermediate elevations. As the result of
   recent research eighteen Cetiocyon species are currently known form New
   Guinea. An updated identification key to all New Guinean species is
   included, along with photographs and illustrations of relevant
   morphological characters.

AB Two new species of Asteronotus are described from the Indo-Pacific
   tropics. Asteronotus mimeticus sp. nov. is described from specimens
   collected in the Philippines, Palau, Australia, and Papua New Guinea.
   Asteronotus spongicolus sp. nov. is described from the three localities
   in Tanzania and one in northern Queensland, Australia. Both species are
   remarkably cryptic on their prey sponges. Asteronotus mimeticus is
   variable in its color and notal ornamentation, depending upon the sponge
   on which it is feeding. Both species differ from the only recognized
   species in the genus, A. cespitosus (van Hasselt, 1824) in their smaller
   body size, lack of regular ridges and rows of tubercles and differences
   in the radular morphology and reproductive system. In A. cespitosus the
   outermost radular tooth is elongate while in the two new species the
   outermost tooth is reduced to an ovoid plate. The accessory gland of A.
   cespitosus is regular in shape with a straight stylet while in the two
   new species the accessory gland is irregularly shaped with a curved
   stylet. Asteronotus mimeticus has a rounded body shape while A.
   spongicolus is more elongate and ovoid. In A. mimeticus, the inner
   radular teeth are usually devoid of denticles, but may rarely have 1-2
   additional denticles on the outer side of the inner 14 radular teeth. In
   A. spongicolus the innermost tooth has 1-2 denticles on its inner side
   and the succeeding 7-11 teeth have 1-2 denticles on the outer side of
   the tooth. The outermost teeth of A. mimeticus are rounded ovoid plates
   while those of A. spongicolus are more quadrangular with an acute apex.
   The reproductive system of A. mimeticus has a bursa copulatrix that is
   smaller than the receptaculum seminis while in A. spongicolus the
   receptaculum is larger than the bursa. The genital atrium of A.
   mimeticus is shorter and narrower than that of A. spongicolus. The
   accessory spine of A. mimeticus has a narrow base and is gradually
   curved while in A. spongicolus the spine has a broad base with a sharply
   curved apex.

AB A long-term goal in evolutionary ecology is to explain the incredible
   diversity of insect herbivores and patterns of host plant use in
   speciose groups like tropical Lepidoptera. Here, we used standardized
   food-web data, multigene phylogenies of both trophic levels and plant
   chemistry data to model interactions between Lepidoptera larvae
   (caterpillars) from two lineages (Geometridae and Pyraloidea) and plants
   in a species-rich lowland rainforest in New Guinea. Model parameters
   were used to make and test blind predictions for two hectares of an
   exhaustively sampled forest. For pyraloids, we relied on phylogeny alone
   and predicted 54% of species-level interactions, translating to 79% of
   all trophic links for individual insects, by sampling insects from only
   15% of local woody plant diversity. The phylogenetic distribution of
   host-plant associations in polyphagous geometrids was less conserved,
   reducing accuracy. In a truly quantitative food web, only 40% of
   pair-wise interactions were described correctly in geometrids.
   Polyphenol oxidative activity (but not protein precipitation capacity)
   was important for understanding the occurrence of geometrids (but not
   pyraloids) across their hosts. When both foliar chemistry and plant
   phylogeny were included, we predicted geometrid-plant occurrence with
   89% concordance. Such models help to test macroevolutionary hypotheses
   at the community level.

AB The variability of rainfall has considerable implications on model
   parameter estimation and calibration, which may lead to a large degree
   of uncertainty in model output from climate change impact assessments,
   water resources planning, and management, design of hydraulic works and
   urban development. Small island developing states (SIDS) are more
   sensitive, and have a lower capacity to adapt to climate change than
   mainland countries, yet, estimates of future rainfall over SIDS are
   subject to large relative uncertainties. Ordinary least squares
   regression analyses are used to model mean annual and monthly rainfall
   in Mauritius over the period 2000-2011, and derive a physical basis for
   understanding spatial patterns in rainfall. The final models incorporate
   latitude, longitude, slope, distance to coast, elevation and their
   interactions and account for 68% of the variance in mean annual rainfall
   and 55-72% of variance in mean monthly rainfall across the island. The
   variables included in the model and the spatial patterns that they bring
   about are physically consistent with basic rainfall generating
   processes. We highlight the value of incorporating the modelled
   estimates into a hydrological model, and discuss the applicability of
   our modelling framework in terms of cost, computational efficiency and
   transferability to other mountainous areas, particularly on small island
   developing states. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Cyanobacterial mats, widely distributed in the inland alkaline marshes
   of northern Belize and other regions in the Caribbean, are not only
   important and functionally complex components of these habitats, but
   they are also significant reservoirs of biological diversity. Highly
   diverse and (relatively) isolated marshes have provided conditions
   suitable for cyanoprokaryotic organisms and conditioned the adaptation
   and stabilization of numerous specialized eco- and morphotypes. Species
   richness of cyanobacteria assemblages follows the conductivity gradient
   and is highest in the marshes of medium conductivity (c. 1000-2000 muS
   cm(-1)) and decreases at low (< 500 muS cm(-1)) and high (> 3000 muS
   cm(-1)) conductivities. This ecologically unique cyanobacterial
   microflora is very sensitive to nutrient enrichment, both directly and
   indirectly through shading by expanding macrophytes. Species richness of
   cyanobacterial assemblages decreases dramatically as a result of
   eutrophication. Similar cyanobacterial communities are widely
   distributed in limestone-based areas of Florida, Central America and
   Caribbean but none of them is currently under any legal protection
   status. The purpose of this paper is to bring attention to an
   ecologically important group of organisms that have traditionally not
   been considered in species diversity evaluations or conservation
   efforts.

AB Conservation priorities are calculated on the basis of species richness,
   endemism, and threats. However, areas ranked highly for these factors
   may not represent regions of maximal evolutionary potential. The
   relationship between geography and evolutionary innovation was analyzed
   in a dominant complex of Caribbean reef corals, in which morphological
   and genetic data concur on species differences. Based on geometric
   morphometrics of Pleistocene corals and genetically characterized modern
   colonies, we found that morphological disparity varies from the center
   to the edge of the Caribbean, and we show that lineages are static at
   well-connected central locations but split or fuse in edge zones where
   gene flow is limited. Thus, conservation efforts in corals should focus
   not only on the centers of diversity but also on peripheral areas of
   species ranges and population connectivity.

   hypophthalmus) were submitted to the University of the West Indies,
   School of Veterinary Medicine, Trinidad and Tobago, for diagnostic
   evaluation. These fish were part of a consignment that arrived from
   Kolkata two weeks earlier. Fish presented with perianal haemorrhage and
   blister-like swellings on the skin which ruptured to leave ulcers.
   Edwardsiella ictaluri was consistently recovered from the brain and
   skin. Repetitive sequence-mediated PCR analysis revealed genetic
   fingerprints consistent with E. ictaluri isolates from farm-raised
   channel catfish in Mississippi, USA. Plasmid analysis of the case
   isolates identified two unique plasmids that differ slightly in
   conformation and content from the pEI1 and pEI2 plasmids described for
   E. ictaluri from other fish hosts. The case isolates were also PCR
   negative for several E. ictaluri virulence factors. The biological
   implications of these genetic differences are unclear and warrant
   further study. This is the first report and documentation of E. ictaluri
   infection in Trinidad and Tobago, suggesting the pathogen may have been
   introduced concurrently with the importation of fish. This report
   emphasizes the importance of adequate health screenings of imported lots
   to minimize the threat of introducing E. ictaluri to non-endemic areas.

   Heron Reef and Moreton Bay in southwestern (SW) Pacific for the last 8
   ka derived from C-14 analysis of Th-230-dated corals. Most of our Delta
   R for the last similar to 5.4 ka agree well with their modern value, but
   large Delta R variability of similar to 410 yr (from trough to peak)
   with possible decadal/centennial fluctuations is evident for the period
   similar to 5.4-8 ka. The latter time interval also has significant
   variations with similar features in previously published Delta R values
   for other sites in the Pacific, including southern Peru-northern Chile
   in southeastern (SE) Pacific, the South China Sea, Vanuatu and Papua New
   Guinea, with the largest magnitude of similar to 920 yr from SE Pacific.
   The mechanisms for these large AR variations across the Pacific during
   the mid-Holocene are complex processes involving (1) changes in the
   quantity and C-14 content of upwelled waters in tropical east Pacific
   (TEP) (frequency and intensity of ocean upwelling in the TEP, and
   contribution of Subantarctic Mode Water to the upwelled waters, which is
   influenced by the intensity and position of southern westerly winds),
   and (2) variations in ocean circulation associated with climate change
   (La Nina/El Nino conditions, intensity of easterly trade winds,
   positions of the Intertropical Convergence Zone and the South Pacific
   Convergence Zone), which control the spreading of the older upwelled
   surface waters in the TEP to the western sites. Our results imply the
   need for employing temporal changes in AR values, instead of constant
   (modern) values, for age calibration of Holocene marine samples not only
   for the SW Pacific sites but also for other tropical and subtropical
   sites in the Pacific. Crown Copyright (C) 2015 Published by Elsevier

   including five new species of the genus Othelosoma Gray, 1869 and the
   introduced Bipalium kewense Moseley, 1878. One of the new species
   represents the first African land flatworm that has specks on its dorsal
   body surface, instead of stripes or a more or less uniform colouration.
   At least two of the new species were observed to prey on snails. The
   study details the fourth record of a sclerotic spermatophore in a
   species of land flatworm, and discusses the definition and homology of
   double female genital canals in African and Indian species of the genus
   Othelosoma.

AB Two statistical models are created for the Caribbean during its dry
   season. Canonical correlation analysis (CCA) confirms that there is a
   robust El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO) signal in the region during
   the dry season and that the mode manifests itself as oppositely signed
   precipitation anomalies over the north and south Caribbean. The
   south-eastern Caribbean becomes dry in response to a warm event. The
   first statistical model consequently uses a rainfall index averaged over
   the south-eastern Caribbean as the predictand. A model which retains an
   ENSO proxy as one of two predictors shows reasonable skill with hindcast
   predictions for the region. A second model is created using a Jamaican
   rainfall index as predictand. Jamaica falls in the transition zone i.e.
   between the oppositely signed north-south precipitation anomalies
   characteristic of the ENSO dry season mode. In this case no ENSO related
   predictor is retained in the final model. Composite analysis of select
   atmospheric variables for anomalously high and low rainfall years (for
   the dry season) give an understanding of the dynamics of the Caribbean
   dry season during phases of the ENSO, particularly those which lead to
   the creation of the transition zone.

AB Genealogical data, land clearance patterns, and garden inheritance
   histories from a patrilineal clan in the Highlands of Papua New Guinea
   are used to reconstruct population size and agrarian resources for the
   descent group over a period of 170 years. The resulting analysis reveals
   a strong relationship between fluctuations in population pressure on
   agrarian resources and changes in the composition of social groups that
   in turn accelerates change, then regulates it. Two quantitative
   relationships show that numbers of outsiders incorporated into the group
   and their kinship distance both covary closely with pressure on land as
   measured by an occupational density index.

AB We undertook a 3-week expedition to Papua New Guinea in April-May 2007
   to assess the breeding, threats and Population densities of the Papuan
   Harrier Circus spilonotus spilothorax and to determine a first global
   Population estimate for this almost entirely unknown species. Two of the
   first nests known were discovered in April 2007 with three chicks each,
   in the eastern lowlands, in rank grass and reeds. The melanistic form of
   this subspecies was more common in the lowlands (< 1,500 m a.s.l) than
   in the highlands, but interbreeding of this and the typical form
   occurred ill the lowlands. Movements of identifiable individuals through
   two highland grasslands indicated up to eight birds per day oil passage,
   corroborating local knowledge that other raptors move into the highlands
   at the start of the dry season (April). Linear road counts indicated no
   harriers in the wooded highlands but Up to 2.9 harriers 10 km(-1) in
   lowland grasslands. Area counts gave all average of 6.5 harriers 100
   km(-2) in the grasslands and a breeding density of 1.21. nests 100
   km(-2). Given that preferred grassland and swamp habitat comprises c. 7%
   of the forest-dominated island of New Guinea, the global Papuan Harrier
   Population can be no more than c. 3,600 birds and c. 740 breeding pairs.
   Wildfires peaked at 38 per month in the Study area, Occur throughout the
   dry season, and led to the loss of both nests. This suggests that many
   nests and prey may be lost at critical times and burning may be
   ultimately detrimental for the species. Grassland fires throughout
   Indonesia and Papua New Guinea are increasing with climatic warming and
   ENSO events, so we suggest that the Papuan Harrier may warrant a
   'Vulnerable' conservation ranking due to small total Population size and
   all accelerated reduction in habitat quality due to ongoing climate
   change.

AB The Convention on Biological Diversity requires that member nations
   establish protected area networks that are representative of the
   country's biodiversity. The identification of priority sites to achieve
   outstanding representation targets is typically accomplished through
   formal conservation assessments. However, representation in conservation
   assessments or gap analyses has largely been interpreted based on a
   static view of biodiversity. In a rapidly changing climate, the speed of
   changes in biodiversity distribution and abundance is causing us to
   rethink the viability of this approach. Here we describe three explicit
   strategies for climate change adaptation as part of national
   conservation assessments: conserving the geophysical stage, identifying
   and protecting climate refugia, and promoting cross-environment
   connectivity. We demonstrate how these three approaches were integrated
   into a national terrestrial conservation assessment for Papua New
   Guinea, one of the most biodiverse countries on earth. Protected areas
   identified based on representing geophysical diversity were able to
   capture over 90% of the diversity in vegetation communities, suggesting
   they could help protect representative biodiversity regardless of
   changes in the distribution of species and communities. By including
   climate change refugia as part of the national conservation assessment,
   it was possible to substantially reduce the amount of environmental
   change expected to be experienced within protected areas, without
   increasing the overall cost of the protected area network. Explicitly
   considering environmental heterogeneity between adjacent areas resulted
   in protected area networks with over 40% more internal environmental
   connectivity. These three climate change adaptation strategies represent
   defensible ways to guide national conservation priority given the
   uncertainty that currently exists in our ability to predict climate
   changes and their impacts. Importantly, they are also consistent with
   data and expertise typically available during national conservation
   assessments, including in developing nations. This means that in the
   vast majority of countries, these strategies could be implemented
   immediately.

AB Since the introduction of cane toads (Bufo marinus) to East New Britain
   75 years ago, they have spread rapidly across Papua New Guinea and
   several of its offshore islands. Their dispersal was thought to be
   limited by habitat constraints such as primary rainforest and altitude.
   However, during a scientific expedition into the Hargy Caldera and
   Nakanai Mountains in 2011, we made several observations of B. marinus
   existing within undisturbed primary rainforest habitat and at altitudes
   greater than 800 m above sea level. Given their propensity to reach
   considerable population densities and threat towards na < ve predators,
   these amphibians have the potential to have negative adverse effects on
   native Papua New Guinean wildlife. Future research on the potential
   ecological impacts of B. marinus in Papua New Guinea should be
   prioritized.

AB Aim To test whether phylogeographical barriers in the brooding sponge
   Callyspongia vaginalis match breaks previously identified in the
   Caribbean. We also compared patterns of subdivision in the sponge to
   those of three of its commensals, the broadcast spawning brittle star
   Ophiothrix suensonii and the brooding amphipods Leucothoe ashleyae and
   L. kensleyi, and tested whether any shared breaks arose simultaneously.
   Location Florida, Bahamas and the Caribbean.
   Methods Subdivision of C. vaginalis populations was inferred from one
   mitochondrial (COI) and six nuclear loci using clustering analyses. We
   identified phylogeographical breaks in the sponge and its invertebrate
   commensals by determining geographical patterns of genetic variation and
   tested simultaneous population divergence across barriers shared among
   taxa using hierarchical approximate Bayesian computation.
   Results Sponge populations were partitioned into western and eastern
   groups across the Caribbean, with hierarchical subdivision within
   regions. The sponge and its commensals shared barriers across their
   ranges despite differences in dispersal strategy: C. vaginalis, L.
   ashleyae and O. suensonii populations in Central America were isolated
   from the remainder of the Caribbean, and all four taxa shared a break
   between Florida and the Bahamas, although simultaneous population
   divergence could not be inferred with statistical certainty. Our results
   also suggest cryptic speciation within C. vaginalis.
   Main conclusions Phylogeographical patterns in C. vaginalis largely
   matched barriers previously identified at the Florida Straits, Mona
   Passage and Bay of Honduras in other Caribbean taxa. Oceanographic
   features such as deep water between locations, strong currents, and
   eddies are likely mechanisms responsible for these breaks.
