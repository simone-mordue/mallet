AB The Santa Cruz Islands region has high seismicity near a 90 degrees bend
   in the boundary between the Pacific and Australian plates. Southward,
   along the Vanuatu island arc, the Australian plate under-thrusts the
   Pacific plate in a well-defined subduction zone. Westward, a
   transpressional, predominantly transform boundary extends to the
   southern Solomon Islands subduction zone. The Santa Cruz Islands region
   has upper plate strike-slip and normal faulting, plate boundary
   under-thrusting, outer rise extensional faulting, and intraplate
   compressional faulting. On February 6, 2013 the largest under-thrusting
   earthquake (M-w 8.0) that has been instrumentally recorded in the region
   ruptured the megathrust The epicenter (10.738 degrees S, 165.138 degrees
   E) is about 1 degrees north of epicenters of prior large shallow
   under-thrusting events in Vanuatu in 1934 (M similar to 7.8) and 1966
   (M-S 7.9), and there is overlap of all three events' aftershock zones,
   but not their large-slip regions. At least 10 lives were lost, with 6
   more missing, due to tsunami similar to 15 m high striking the town of
   Lata and several villages on the main Santa Cruz Island of Nendo (Ndeni)
   and a nearby small island Nibanga. Inundation of 500 m flooded the Lata
   airport. The tsunami was well-recorded by DART buoys spanning an
   unusually wide three-quadrant azimuthal aperture. Iterative modeling of
   teleseismic broadband P waves and the deep-water tsunami recordings
   resolves the slip distribution. There are two large-slip patches with a
   southeastward rupture expansion at about 1.5 km/s, with the second patch
   appearing to have ruptured with large slip at the trench. The event has
   relatively low short-period seismic wave energy release, but a typical
   overall moment-scaled total energy. The shallow rupture depth may be
   associated with the low level of short-period energy, and a near-total
   stress drop may account for a lack of underthrusting aftershocks among a
   highly productive aftershock sequence that included three events with
   M-w >= 7.0. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB During 1991-1994, repeated measurements of current structure and water
   mass properties were made in the major southern passages to the
   Caribbean Sea between Trinidad and Dominica. A total of 10 cruises were
   performed in different seasons, consisting primarily of serial station
   occupations in the Grenada, St Vincent, St Lucia, and Dominica Passages.
   This data set is by far the most comprehensive available in these
   passages and better determines the mean flow and range of variability
   than do previous studies. The flow structure in these passages is
   characterized by a strong and relatively stable inflow above the
   thermocline (approximately the upper 100 m), and a more highly variable
   flow regime within and below the thermocline. Typical near-surface
   inflow velocities in Grenada and St Vincent passages were 40-60 cm
   s(-1), with maximum observed currents of 90 cm s(-1). Frequently,
   counterflows were observed below this surface layer flowing out of the
   Caribbean, trapped to the southern side of the passages. This subsurface
   counterflow appeared to be strongest and most prevalent in Grenada
   Passage, where outflow speeds as large as 30 cm s(-1) were observed. As
   a result, the ensemble mean sections for the three southern passages
   exhibit a deep inflow concentrated in the northern and central parts of
   the passages, and weak outflow on the southern sides. The ensemble of
   measurements from this program indicate a mean transport of 9.5 +/- 3 x
   10(6)m(3)s(-1) through the southern passages, with a range of
   variability from 3 to 17 x 10(6) m(3) s(-1). No clear annual cycle is
   apparent in the passage transports. Mean transports calculated for the
   individual passages were 4.7, 3.4, 0.9, and 0.5 x 10(6) m(3) s(-1),
   respectively, for Grenada, St Vincent, St Lucia, and Dominica Passages,
   decreasing monotonically northward and indicating that Grenada and St
   Vincent Passages largely dominate the inflow to the southern Caribbean.
   Consideration of this data set, historical data, Sverdrup theory and
   numerical model results suggests that very little of the mean inflow to
   the Caribbean through the southern passages can be attributed to
   wind-driven circulation, and that most of the transport (6-8 x 10(6)
   m(3) s(-1)) is derived from South Atlantic waters crossing the equator
   in the upper limb of the Atlantic thermohaline cell. The remainder of
   the upper ocean thermohaline transport likely follows a different route
   into the subtropical gyre, possibly flowing northward in the interior
   and entering the Caribbean through the more northern passages.

AB This study assessed nearshore, marine ecosystem function around Trinidad
   and Tobago (TT). The coastline of TT is highly complex, bordered by the
   Atlantic Ocean, the Caribbean Sea, the Gulf of Paria and the Columbus
   Channel, and subject to local terrestrial runoff and regional riverine
   inputs (e.g. the Orinoco and Amazon rivers). Coastal organisms can
   assimilate energy from allochthonous and autochthonous Sources, We
   assessed whether stable isotopes delta C-13 and delta N-15 Could be used
   to provide a rapid assessment of trophic interactions in primary
   consumers around the islands. Filter-feeding (bivalves and barnacles)
   and grazing organisms (gastropods and chitons) were collected from 40
   marine sites during the wet season. The flesh of organisms was analysed
   for delta C-13 and delta N-15. Results indicate significant variation in
   primary consumers (by feeding guild and sampling zone). This variation
   was linked to different energy Sources being assimilated by consumers.
   Results suggest that offshore production is fuelling intertidal
   foodwebs; for example, a depleted delta C-13 signature in grazers from
   the Gulf of Paria, Columbus Channel and the Caribbean and Atlantic
   coastline of 9 Tobago indicates that carbon with an offshore origin
   (e.g. phytoplankton and dissolved organic matter) is more important than
   benthic or littoral algae (luring the wet season. Results also confirm
   findings from other studies indicating that much of the coastline is
   subject to Cultural eutrophication. This Study revealed that ecosystem
   function is spatially variable around the coastline of TT, This has
   clear implications for marine resource management, as a single
   management approach is unlikely to be successful at a national level.

AB Limestone-based (karstic) freshwater wetlands of the Everglades, Belize,
   Mexico, and Jamaica are distinctive in having a high biomass of
   CaCO3-rich periphyton mats. Diatoms are common components of these mats
   and show predictable responses to environmental variation, making them
   good candidates for assessing nutrient enrichment in these naturally
   ultraoligotrophic wetlands. However, aside from in the Everglades of
   southern Florida, very little research has been done to document the
   diatoms and their environmental preferences in karstic Caribbean
   wetlands, which are increasingly threatened by eutrophication. We
   identified diatoms in periphyton mats collected during wet and dry
   periods from the Everglades and similar freshwater karstic wetlands in
   Belize, Mexico, and Jamaica. We compared diatom assemblage composition
   and diversity among locations and periods, and the effect of the
   limiting nutrient, P, on species composition among locations. We used
   periphyton-mat total P (TP) as a metric of availability. A total of 176
   diatom species in 45 genera were recorded from the 4 locations.
   Twenty-three of these species, including 9 that are considered
   indicative of Everglades diatom flora, were found in all 4 locations. In
   Everglades and Caribbean sites, we identified assemblages and indicator
   species associated with low and high periphyton-mat TP and calculated TP
   optima and tolerances for each indicator species. TP optima and
   tolerances of indicator species differed between the Everglades and the
   Caribbean, but weighted averaging models predicted periphyton-mat TP
   concentrations from diatom assemblages at Everglades (R-2 = 0.56) and
   Caribbean (R-2 = 0.85) locations. These results show that diatoms can be
   effective indicators of water quality in karstic wetlands of the
   Caribbean, but application of regionally generated transfer functions to
   distant sites provides less reliable estimates than locally developed
   functions.

AB Affordable renewable energy is one key criterion for the long-term
   economic growth of Caribbean small island countries. The southernmost
   Caribbean islands, Trinidad and Tobago, have one of the lowest
   electricity rates in the region due to an indigenous source of
   hydrocarbons. In this study, technical and economic assessments were
   conducted to determine the levelized cost of electricity (LCOE)
   generation from the wind in these Caribbean islands. The assessments
   used extrapolations of 10 m level wind data sets for the two sites with
   long-term measurements (1989-2009), Crown Point and Piarco, and wind
   turbine characteristics of eight wind energy conversion systems ranging
   from 20 kW to 3050 kW. The annual average wind speeds at the 80 m height
   above ground were estimated to be 6.93 m/s and 5.86 m/s at Crown Point
   and Piarco, respectively, while corresponding estimates of wind power
   densities were 381 W m(-2) and 296 W m(-2). The projected LCOEs for the
   large wind turbines, 1500 kW and greater, were less than the current
   subsidized residential tariff of US/$0.06/kWh. The Goldwind 1.5/87 1500
   kW model produced the lowest LCOEs, US$0.031-US$0.039/kWh. The large
   wind turbines also have projected capacity factors in the range
   0.22-0.39. Electricity generation from wind energy through the use of
   tall, large contemporary wind turbines could therefore be
   cost-competitive with electricity generation from hydrocarbons and is
   not prohibitively expensive as it is currently perceived. These results
   support government initiatives for large-scale wind farm developments as
   one avenue for diversifying the energy mix.

AB In this article we concentrate on the discursive links between climate
   change, migration, land, and imagined futures. We argue that the large
   tract of freehold land purchased by Kiribati's government in Fiji has
   led citizens in both countries to develop imaginings of migration, which
   we interpret as building blocks for a cultural construct of the future,
   in anticipation of projected hazards resulting from climate change and
   sea level rise. We show that, contrary to official pronouncements that
   the land had been acquired for reasons of food security, many citizens
   of Kiribati and Fiji associated the purchase with the option of a future
   relocation. Thus I-Kiribati have taken to perceiving this property in
   terms of their concept of land, hoping that, in the event of an
   existential threat, this new land will allow them to preserve culture,
   nation, and identity over the long term. Citizens of Fiji, too, rely on
   their concept of land, as when they see that survival for I-Kiribati
   will only be possible if they can ground it in a territory of their own.
   Moreover, the governments of Kiribati and Fiji both engage in a politics
   of hope that contributed to imaginings of migration. We conclude that
   the emerging discourses on migration related to the land purchase were
   fostered by cultural conceptions of land as well as the climate policies
   of the two Pacific Island states.

AB A relatively new development to the milieu of archaeological techniques
   routinely used in the Pacific Island region, the stable isotope analysis
   of human skeletal and dental remains has provided important insights
   into diet, methods of subsistence and also intra-population variation in
   diet that may be related to age, sex or status. This study is a stable
   isotope analysis of one of the largest skeletal samples discovered in
   the Pacific Islands, from the Namu burial ground (ca. 700-300 BP)
   located on the small island of Taumako, Southeast Solomon Islands. Here,
   the stable isotope ratios of carbon and nitrogen of bone collagen (n =
   142, delta(13)Cbone and delta(15)Nbone) and tooth dentine (n = 86,
   delta(13)Ctooth and delta(15)Ntooth) are analysed to assess adult
   (survivor) and subadult (non-survivor) diets and patterns of
   breastfeeding, which also provided insight into possible maternal and
   foetal/ perinatal stress in the population. The d13Cbone and d15Nbone
   results suggested that the adolescents and juveniles who died were
   eating foods from lower trophic levels than those who survived to
   adulthood, especially the males. The d13Ctooth and delta(15)Ntooth
   stable isotope values suggested that, during the ages of 5-9 years,
   individuals were eating more terrestrial and less marine foods than
   later in life as adults. The sex differences in adult diet
   (delta(13)Cbone and delta(15)Nbone values) were not present as children
   (delta(13)Ctooth and delta(15)Ntooth values). The intra-population
   variation is discussed in the context of wider Pacific island diet and
   cultural processes and recent developments in understanding stress and
   disease processes on human stable isotope values.

AB Global sea level rise clue to the thermal expansion of the warming
   oceans and freshwater input from melting glaciers and ice sheets is
   threatening to inundate low-lying islands and coastlines worldwide. At
   present the global mean sea level rises at 3.1 +/- 0.7 mm yr(-1) with an
   accelerating tendency. However, the magnitude of recent decadal sea
   level trends varies greatly spatially, attaining values of up to 10 mm
   yr(-1) in some areas of the western tropical Pacific. Identifying the
   causes of recent regional sea level trends and understanding the
   patterns of future projected sea level change is of crucial importance.
   Using a wind-forced simplified dynamical ocean model, the study shows
   that the regional features of recent decadal and multidecadal sea level
   trends in the tropical Indo-Pacific can be attributed to changes in the
   prevailing wind regimes. Furthermore, it is demonstrated that within an
   ensemble of 10 state-of-the-art coupled general circulation models,
   forced by increasing atmospheric CO2 concentrations over the next
   century, wind-induced redistributions of upper-ocean water play a key
   role in establishing the spatial characteristics of projected regional
   sea level rise. Wind-related changes in near-surface mass and heat
   convergence near the Solomon Islands, Tuvalu, Kiribati, the Cook
   Islands, and French Polynesia oppose-but cannot cancel-the regional
   signal of global mean sea level rise.

AB The Indo-Pacific is an area of intense ecological interest, not least
   because of the region's rich biodiversity. Important insights into the
   origins, evolutionary history, and maintenance of Indo-Pacific reef
   faunas depend upon the analysis of faunal occurrences derived from
   detailed stratigraphic sections. We investigated Neogene origination and
   extinction patterns derived from a combination of new coral occurrences
   and previously published records from the central Indo-West Pacific
   Ocean (cIWP, Indonesia, Papua New Guinea and Fiji). Two faunal turnover
   events were observed. In the first, an increase in generic richness of
   Scleractinia from the cIWP during the middle Miocene (17-14 Ma)
   coincided with both large-scale sea level fluctuations and the great
   Mid-Miocene collision event. We raise the hypothesis that Mid-Miocene
   origination was facilitated by habitat and population fragmentation
   associated with tectonism and sea level fall. The second, subsequent,
   turnover event was characterized by an overall lowering of generic
   diversity throughout the late Miocene and Pliocene (7-3 Ma), and was
   followed by a pronounced pulse of extinction at the Pliocene-Pleistocene
   boundary (similar to 2.6 Ma). With the exception of the onset of
   Pleistocene sea-level cycles and the onset of northern hemisphere
   glaciation around 2.5 Ma, which might explain increased extinction
   during this time interval, there are no tectonic, eustatic, climatic or
   oceanographic events that neatly coincide with this second episode of
   Neogene coral taxonomic turnover. Our results reveal a total of 62
   genera, including synonyms, from the Miocene to the Pleistocene. Neither
   episode of turnover among coral genera is exactly coincident with
   turnover in the Atlantic thus regional environmental change is found to
   drive Neogene reef dynamics.

AB Karst landscapes in the Caribbean cover nearly 130,000km(2), more than
   half the total land area of the region. Approximately 90% of the karst
   is on the Greater Antilles, with other significant areas in the Bahamas,
   Anguilla, Antigua, the Cayman Islands, the Virgin Islands, Guadeloupe,
   Barbados, Trinidad and Tobago, and the Netherlands Antilles. There is
   considerable heterogeneity, but the Caribbean contains many "classic"
   karst landscapes, including cockpits, towers, dry valleys, dolines
   (sinkholes), blue holes and caves. The karst has played an important
   role in Caribbean history, as a focus of resistance to colonial power,
   and as a basis for subsistence agriculture following emancipation and
   independence, increasingly incorporating commercial agriculture,
   urbanization and industrial activities, and tourism. Karst landscape
   provides a critical physical backdrop for many of the Caribbean's
   environmental, agricultural, economic and cultural issues, and its
   sustainability is critical to regional wellbeing.
   The Caribbean karstlands are challenging to human habitation, since they
   possess a broad array of natural hazards, such as drought and flooding,
   but they are also inherently fragile, at risk of degradation and
   vulnerable to environmental change. Despite this vulnerability to
   environmental change, under rational management regimes there is no
   inherent reason why human use should not be sustainable in the long
   term. Human impacts, however, have been long-term and severe,
   particularly through destruction of natural vegetation, contamination of
   water supplies, urbanization and quarrying.
   The Caribbean karst continues to play important roles locally,
   nationally and regionally in water supply, mining and quarrying,
   agriculture, tourism and conservation, all of which represent specific
   and collective challenges to sustainability of the karst environment.
   Additionally, sustainability is threatened by the consequences of
   anthropogenic climatic change, which is predicted to lead to increasing
   air and water temperatures, rising sea levels and changing weather
   patterns, including decreasing precipitation totals, and the increasing
   frequency of extreme events, such as droughts and hurricanes, the
   effects of all of which will be magnified in the karst, particularly
   with respect to karst hydrology.
   Disruption of the karst hydrological cycle may lead to increasing
   aridity and desertification, with concomitant impacts on ecology and
   potential land use. Increasing population and economic development will
   further exacerbate human impacts on the karst landscapes. Climate change
   and other human impacts will increasingly threaten already at-risk and
   vulnerable ecosystems and human communities, necessitating integration
   of climate change parameters and the adoption of appropriate risk
   management measures. The severity of these impacts may be reduced by
   appropriate land management and land use planning, which are necessary
   ingredients for long-term sustainability.

AB The relationship between salinity and the stable oxygen isotope ratio of
   seawater (O-18(sw)) is of utmost importance to the quantitative
   reconstruction of past changes in salinity from O-18 values of marine
   carbonates. This relationship is often considered to be uniform across
   water masses, but the constancy of the O-18(sw)-salinity relationship
   across space and time remains uncertain, as O-18(sw) responds to varying
   atmospheric vapor sources and pathways, while salinity does not. Here we
   present new O-18(sw)-salinity data from sites spanning the tropical
   Pacific Ocean. New data from Palau, Papua New Guinea, Kiritimati, and
   Galapagos show slopes ranging from 0.09 /psu in the Galapagos to
   0.32/psu in Palau. The slope of the O-18(sw)-salinity relationship is
   higher in the western tropical Pacific versus the eastern tropical
   Pacific in observations and in two isotope-enabled climate model
   simulations. A comparison of O-18(sw)-salinity relationships derived
   from short-term spatial surveys and multiyear time series at Papua New
   Guinea and Galapagos suggests spatial relationships can be substituted
   for temporal relationships at these sites, at least within the time
   period of the investigation. However, the O-18(sw)-salinity relationship
   varied temporally at Palau, likely in response to water mass changes
   associated with interannual El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO)
   variability, suggesting nonstationarity in this local O-18(sw)-salinity
   relationship. Applying local O-18(sw)-salinity relationships in a coral
   O-18 forward model shows that using a constant, basinwide
   O-18(sw)-salinity slope can both overestimate and underestimate the
   contribution of O-18(sw) to carbonate O-18 variance at individual sites
   in the western tropical Pacific.

AB Migration and remittances characterise many small Pacific islands, where
   local livelihoods are limited, and the need for money has increased. A
   majority of Paamese have left the island of Paama, in the central island
   chain of Vanuatu, and more now live in the capital city, Port Vila, than
   on Paama. Remittances are bidirectional, between the island and Vila, a
   duality that has rarely been discussed in Melanesia. Almost every
   household on Paama and in Vila is involved in sending and receiving
   remittances. Remittances usually involve food: modern' foods (such as
   rice) flowing from Vila, and island foods (yams and laplap) travelling
   to Vila. While such transfers make little formal economic sense, they
   emphasise a constant process of negotiating and manipulating social
   relationships. Food, as an expression of identity and locality, is a
   powerful and repetitive reminder of moral obligations and rural-urban
   kinship connections. The material significance of exchange is thus less
   than its affective significance, within the field of reciprocity that
   structures kin relationships. Food and remittances have become metaphors
   for defining the experience of migration, as their meaning and function
   are more than to merely provide a source of nutrition. They have also
   become the means of structuring a translocal moral economy.

AB Contemporary movements towards trade liberalisation have influenced

   growth have always been restricted. The new free trade, centred on
   comparative advantage, is especially challenging for countries producing
   sugar, where diversification is difficult, and for the smallest states
   where trade options have always been limited. New regional trade
   agreements have been introduced in the Pacific as a step towards global
   free trade, but have emphasised trade rivalry and conflict,
   characterised by the 'kava-biscuit war' between Fiji and Vanuatu, rather
   than complementary trade and cooperation. Movement towards free trade
   poses acute problems for island states, yet international agreements
   have not recognised their particular disadvantages, and continue to
   stress benefits that are nowhere apparent in the Pacific.

AB Contemporary precipitation patterns in the Caribbean region are
   spatially variable, and the small number of Holocene paleoclimatic
   records may not adequately capture patterns of variation in the past.
   The hydrological history of Grenada was inferred from paleolimnological
   analyses of sediment cores from two crater lakes on the island. The
   basins were formed by volcanic activity some time during the Last
   Termination, but were dry between ca. 13 000 and ca. 7200 cal. a BP.
   After filling, the lakes were initially very shallow, and sedimentation
   was interrupted by a hiatus ca. 6300-5500 cal. a BP, followed by
   deposition of a thick tephra in both sites. After 5500 cal. a BP, lake
   level shows considerable multi-centennial variability, superimposed upon
   a long-term trend of generally higher lake level after 3200 cal. a BP.
   The pattern of lake-level variation in Grenada shows some similarity
   with other Caribbean paleoclimatic records in terms of the timing of
   transitions, but differs from several classic studies in the sign of
   inferred precipitation change. The differences among records may reflect
   spatially variable precipitation patterns in the past in response to the
   position of the Intertropical Convergence Zone and to sea surface
   temperature influences on the trade winds and Caribbean low-level jet.

AB In many Least Developed Countries (LDCs) and Small Island Developing

   programmes are currently being operationalised or are in the pipeline. A
   key focus is on motivating householders to adapt in anticipation of
   climate change through pilot community projects. In this paper, we argue
   that the water sector must pay equal attention to how communities
   cognitively perceive the process of adaptation if interventions are to
   be effective. Adopting a cognitive model to gain such insights we
   conclude that individual's belief in their own abilities to manage water
   stress play a crucial role in driving intentions to adapt and therefore
   greater attention needs to be placed on understanding the underling
   drivers shaping such beliefs. Crown Copyright (C) 2010 Published by

AB Invasive Red Lionfish (Pterois volitans) continue to spread along
   tropical and subtropical coasts of the Western Atlantic, Caribbean, and
   Gulf of Mexico. They may have escaped natural controls present in their
   native Pacific, thus facilitating their immense success as predators in
   the Atlantic. We hypothesized that such ecological release would
   translate into faster individual growth and larger average body lengths
   in the invaded range relative to the native range. We used
   mark-release-recapture methods to monitor lionfish growth in two island
   systems in both the Pacific and the Atlantic. We compared the average
   individual lionfish growth rates among all four islands and between the
   two oceans, and compared population-level von Bertalanffy growth
   functions between oceans. While our study was limited to two sites in
   each ocean basin, we found consistent growth patterns within oceans and
   a significant difference between oceans, with lionfish in the Atlantic
   growing 1.25 to 2.25 times faster than lionfish in the Pacific. The von
   Bertalanffy model predicted larger average asymptotic lengths for the
   Atlantic population (322 vs. 225 mm). Given that lionfish consume prey
   up to half their body length, and that larger lionfish may be less
   vulnerable to predation, these findings, if broadly representative,
   suggest that invasive lionfish may consume larger native fish and may
   have higher survival than lionfish in their native range.

AB Pacific island countries face significant challenges in improving
   livelihoods and overcoming poverty, particularly with the food and fuel
   price surges in 2008, the impact of the global economic crisis, a number
   of natural disasters, difficulties maintaining infrastructure, and the
   negative effects of climate change. In addressing some of these
   challenges, Pacific island countries and international agencies
   recognise that improving the competitiveness of industries, which
   provide a platform for stronger economic growth, is the basis of
   overcoming many of these challenges. The importance of agricultural
   development in alleviating poverty and providing a catalyst for
   sustainable economic growth has been widely documented.
   In the Pacific, agricultural productivity tends to be derived from
   traditional small-holder farming systems, with horticultural production
   and associated supply chains representing one of the fastest growing
   components. Issues affecting the horticultural sector in the Pacific
   include distance from markets, small and inconsistent scale of
   production, high transport costs, eroding tariff preferences, technical
   market access barriers, migration of skilled labour, resource depletion
   and degradation, and risks from climate change. In meeting these
   challenges, a network of Australian universities and agencies, the
   Secretariat of Pacific Island Communities (SPC) and the University of
   the South Pacific, supported by ACIAR, have developed an innovative
   approach to horticultural development based around intervention
   priorities generated by supply chain and market analysis. Rather than
   pre-defining a specific set of commodities or researchable priorities
   the Pacific Agribusiness Research for Development Initiative (PARDI)
   incorporates a 'market-oriented' approach to identify horticulture
   products and chain opportunities. PARDI delivery has integrated
   horticultural scientists with social scientists and market analysts.
   This paper outlines the methodologies and preliminary project outcomes,
   with specific focus on horticulture development in Fiji, Vanuatu and the
   Solomon Islands.

AB This paper reviews work on the currents of northern Papua New Guinea and
   then examines recent observations with a research vessel, moored
   instruments, simple drifters, and NOAA satellite AVHRR and RADARSAT
   synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imagery. The dominant large scale
   features are: the strong New Guinea Coastal Undercurrent that flows
   through Vitiaz Strait and then reaches along the coast towards Irian
   Jaya; the New Guinea Coastal Current that reverses with the monsoons;
   and a wind-driven upwelling plume from SW New Britain during the SE
   monsoon that joins Solomon Sea waters to flow through Vitiaz Str to
   bathe the offshore islands, as well as spreading along the PNG coast.
   During the ship survey in the SE monsoon season the surface plume from
   the Sepik River was only about 2 m thick and it moved offshore similar
   to 10 km at 1 m s(-1) before being turned to the NW by the underlying
   currents. A coincident SAR scene provided a large-scale snapshot of the
   plume. The plume switched to flow SE at the end of the several-day ship
   survey. During the NW monsoon another SAR scene showed the plume
   streaming to the SE. The waters down to several hundred metres in the
   Sepik study area were comprised of stacks of many mixed layers, with
   enhanced loads of suspended sediment at the bases of most of them. These
   subsurface sediment plumes became depleted with increasing distance
   offshore. Although the tides in the region are small, moored instruments
   showed semi-diurnal internal tidal currents to have amplitudes up to
   0.15 m s(-1) and to be associated with vertical oscillations of perhaps
   40-50 m. The waters of Goodenough Basin in eastern PNG were mixed from
   500 m to the bottom at 1300 m, with energetic subsurface flows at the
   sills.

AB We investigated the distribution and relative abundance of adult
   flyingfish by transect visual survey across a 67 500 square nautical
   mile (nmi(2)) area of the eastern Caribbean from April 10 to May 6,
   1988, using a 26 m research vessel and a rotating team of 23 observers.
   Flyingfish abundance (no. of fish per 0.5 nmi) was significantly
   correlated between data sets from port and starboard viewing stations,
   and we detected no evidence of observer bias. Flyingfish abundance
   varied significantly across the survey area, but was not correlated with
   any of the surface water characteristics measured (temperature,
   salinity, NO2-NO3-N, PO4-P, silicate). For the commercially harvested
   species Hirundichthys affinis, as well as for the smaller Parexocoetus
   brachypterus, abundance was high west (leeward) of the Lesser Antilles
   island chain and in an area between and to the east of Barbados and
   Tobago, and it was low between the Lesser Antilles chain and Barbados
   and Tobago. Cypselurus cyanopterus was less common than H. affinis and
   P. brachypterus, and was largely restricted to the northeast of the
   survey area. Flyingfish distribution was patchy in all geographical
   zones of the survey area, mean patch width being 3.9 nmi and mean
   inter-patch distance 2.0 nmi. Patch width and patch density (fish
   density in patch) were positively correlated with each other and with
   flyingfish abundance on a transect, and inter-patch distance was
   negatively correlated with fish abundance. Both within and outside of
   patches, flyingfish occurred in schools. Flyingfish fleets from eastern
   Caribbean islands presently fish across areas of both high and low H.
   affinis abundance. Moreover, H. affinis abundance did not appear to
   decrease towards the east or west boundaries of the survey area,
   suggesting that catch rates may be similar to current rates if fishing
   fleets expanded their present geographical range. The high abundance
   indices obtained for P. brachypterus indicate that the feasibility of
   developing a small-scale fishery for this species in the eastern
   Caribbean should be further explored.

AB The Statistical Downscaling Model (SDSM) is used to investigate future
   projections of daily minimum and maximum temperature extremes for 45
   stations and rainfall extremes for 39 stations across the Caribbean and
   neighbouring regions. Models show good skill in reproducing the monthly
   climatology of the mean daily temperatures and the frequencies of warm
   days, warm nights, cool days and cool nights between 1961 and 2001.
   Models for rainfall exhibit lower skill but generally capture the
   monthly climatology of mean daily rainfall and the spatial distribution
   of the mean annual maximum number of consecutive dry days (CDD) and mean
   annual count of days with daily rainfall above 10mm (R10). Future
   projections suggest an increase (decrease) in warm (cool) days and
   nights by 2071-2099 under the A2 and B2 scenarios relative to 1961-1990.
   An increase in CDD is suggested for most stations except some eastern
   Caribbean stations and Bahamas. Decreases in RX1 (monthly maximum 1-day
   precipitation), R10 and R95p (annual total rainfall above the 95th
   percentile) are also suggested for some northern Caribbean locations and
   Belize under the A2 scenario, compared to a mixture of increases and
   decreases for the eastern Caribbean. Atmospheric predictors used in SDSM
   correlate well with known oceanic and atmospheric drivers of Caribbean
   climate, e.g. the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation (AMO) on a seasonal
   timescale. Atlantic sea surface temperatures and the Caribbean low level
   jet appear to have significant influence on Caribbean temperature and
   rainfall extremes.

AB Background
   In 2012 the World Health Assembly adopted resolution WHA65.21 on
   elimination of schistosomiasis, calling for increased investment in
   schistosomiasis control and support for countries to initiate
   elimination programs. This study aims to analyze prevalence and
   intensity of Schistosoma mansoni infection in children in Latin America
   and the Caribbean countries and territories (LAC), at the second
   administrative level or lower.
   Methodology
   A systematic review of schistosomiasis prevalence and intensity of
   infection was conducted by searching at PubMed, LILACS and EMBASE.
   Experts on the topic were informally consulted and institutional web
   pages were reviewed (PAHO/WHO, Ministries of Health). Only SCH infection
   among children was registered because it can be a 'proxi-indicator' of
   recent transmission by the time the study is conducted.
   Principal Findings
   One hundred thirty two full-text articles met the inclusion criteria and
   provided 1,242 prevalence and 199 intensity of infection data points.
   Most of them were from Brazil (69.7%). Only Brazil published studies
   after 2001, showing several 'hot spots' with high prevalence. Brazil,
   Venezuela, Suriname and Saint Lucia need to update the epidemiological
   status of schistosomiasis to re-design their national programs and
   target the elimination of Schistosoma mansoni transmission by 2020. In
   Antigua and Barbuda, Dominican Republic, Guadeloupe, Martinique,
   Montserrat and Puerto Rico schistosomiasis transmission may be
   interrupted. However the compilation of an elimination dossier and
   follow-up surveys, per WHO recommendations, are needed to verify that
   status. Hence, the burden of subtle SCH chronic infection may be still
   present and even high in countries that may have eliminated
   transmission. Heterogeneity in the methodologies used for monitoring and
   evaluating the progress of the schistosomiasis programs was found,
   making cross-national and chronological comparisons difficult.
   Conclusions
   There is a need for updating the schistosomiasis status in the
   historically endemic countries and territories in LAC to address the
   required public health interventions for control and elimination
   programs or to verify the elimination of transmission of Schistosoma
   mansoni. Improved reporting and standardization of the monitoring and
   evaluation methodologies used are recommended, while using available WHO
   guidelines. Meeting a regional elimination goal will require additional
   and improved epidemiological data by age group and sex.

AB Phytoplankton growth in the eastern equatorial Pacific Ocean today
   accounts for about half of the 'new' production-the fraction of primary
   production fuelled by externally supplied nutrients-in the global ocean.
   The recent demonstration that an inadequate supply of iron limits
   primary production in this region(1) supports earlier speculation that,
   in the past, fluctuations in the atmospheric deposition of iron-bearing
   dust may have driven large changes in productivity(2). But we argue here
   that only small (similar to 2 nM) increases in the iron concentration in
   source waters of the upwelling Equatorial Undercurrent are needed to
   fuel intense diatom production across the entire eastern equatorial
   Pacific Ocean. Episodic increases in iron concentrations of this
   magnitude or larger were probably frequent in the past because a large
   component of the undercurrent originates in the convergent island-are
   region of Papua New Guinea, which has experienced intensive volcanic,
   erosional and seismic activity over the past 16 million years. Cycles of
   plankton productivity recorded in eastern equatorial Pacific sediments
   may therefore reflect the influence of tectonic processes in the Papua
   New Guinea region superimposed on the effects of global climate forcing.

AB Species assemblages vary in structure due to a wide variety of processes
   operating at ecological and much broader biogeographical scales.
   Cross-scale studies of assemblage structure are necessary to fully
   understand this variability. Here, we evaluate the abundance and
   occupancy patterns of hierarchically sampled coral assemblages in three
   habitats ( reef flat, crest, and slope) and five regions ( Indonesia,
   Papua New Guinea, the Solomon Islands, American Samoa, and the Society
   Islands) across the west-central Pacific Ocean. Specifically, we compare
   two alternative models that unify spatial variance and occupancy via the
   negative binomial distribution. The first assumes a power-law scaling
   between the mean and variance of abundance; the second assumes a
   quadratic variance-mean relationship and a constant abundance-invariant
   aggregation parameter. Surprisingly, the well-established power-law
   model performs worse than the model assuming abundance-invariant
   aggregation, for both variance-mean and occupancy-abundance
   relationships. We also find strong evidence for regional and habitat
   variation in these relationships and in the levels of aggregation
   estimated by the abundance-invariant aggregation model. Among habitats,
   corals on reef flats exhibited lower occupancy and higher levels of
   aggregation compared to reef crests and slopes. Among regions, low
   occupancy and high aggregation were most pronounced across all habitats
   in American Samoa. These patterns may be related to habitat and regional
   differences in disturbance and recovery processes. Our results suggest
   that the spatial scaling of abundance and occupancy is sensitive to
   processes operating among these habitats and at regional scales.
   However, the consistency of these relationships across species within
   assemblages suggests that a theoretical unification of spatial variance
   and occupancy patterns is indeed possible.

AB The destruction caused by tropical cyclone (TC) Pam in March 2015 is
   considered one of the worst natural disasters in the history of Vanuatu.
   It has highlighted the need for a better understanding of TC impacts and
   adaptation in the Southwest Pacific (SWP) region. Therefore, the key
   aims of this study are to (i) understand local perceptions of TC
   activity, (ii) investigate impacts of TC activity and (iii) uncover
   adaptation strategies used to offset the impacts of TCs. To address
   these aims, a survey (with 130 participants from urban areas) was
   conducted across three SWP small island states (SISs): Fiji, Vanuatu and
   Tonga (FVT). It was found that respondents generally had a high level of
   risk perception and awareness of TCs and the associated physical
   impacts, but lacked an understanding of the underlying weather
   conditions. Responses highlighted that current methods of adaptation
   generally occur at the local level, immediately prior to a TC event
   (preparation of property, gathering of food, finding a safe place to
   shelter). However higher level adaptation measures (such as the
   modification to building structures) may reduce vulnerability further.
   Finally, we discuss the potential of utilising weather-related
   traditional knowledge and non-traditional knowledge of empirical and
   climate-model-based weather forecasts to improve TC outlooks, which
   would ultimately reduce vulnerability and increase adaptive capacity.
   Importantly, lessons learned from this study may result in the
   modification and/ or development of existing adaptation strategies.

AB This paper examines the resilience of households in Vanuatu and Solomon
   Islandstwo small island developing states in Melanesia renowned for
   their vulnerabilitiesto the adverse effects of global macroeconomic
   shocks. The focus is on the spike in international food and fuel prices
   in 2008 and the subsequent shock to global demand, known as the Global
   Economic Crisis (GEC). Using a unique retrospective cross-section
   survey, the results show that experience of these shocks was widespread
   across urban and rural areas. Households with more education, access to
   income-generating activitiesparticularly in the informal sectorand
   greater wealth were best placed to withstand a deterioration in their
   well-being, measured as a fall in self-reported disposable income.
   Households also employed a variety of coping strategies in response to
   the shocks. Local food gardens and informal insurance are seen as key
   safety nets in times of stress, yet neither provided full insurance from
   the shocks. Some households, particularly in urban areas, employed
   harmful coping strategies, such as reducing spending on health,
   education, and food. While potentially effective in withstanding a
   temporary fall in disposable income, these responses are likely to
   weaken overall resilience and leave households vulnerable to future

AB Three tropical islands - Trinidad, Dominica and St. Lucia - in the
   British Caribbean were surveyed for location of coastal herbaceous
   halophytic plant communities native to upper, intertidal sandy beaches.
   Comparisons of earlier and later drawn topographical maps displayed
   marked urban expansion indicating the disappearance of native beach
   vegetation. Hierarchial cluster analysis revealed marked similarities
   among sites on these islands. Studies of alpha and gamma diversity of
   the few, viable communities located along back beaches revealed that,
   like temperate sandy communities, these communities were generally
   characterized by a small number of perennial halophytic species. At most
   locations, the community was dominated by only one species - Ipomea
   pes-caprae - accompanied by a few sub-dominant species. Governments of
   these islands should consider preserving the few remaining native beach
   plant communities for future scientific studies.

AB The state of our taxonomic and geographic knowledge of Collembola from
   the West Indies Archipelago is presented, country by country, with their
   bibliography. Among these 218 species, 73 are presumed endemic (about
   33.5%), 58 are neotropical (26%), 30 cosmopolitan (14%), 26 from the
   West Indies (12%), 14 from the American continent (6.5%), 7 pantropical
   (3%) and 10 are common to Europe, Asia or the Holarctic. Up to 72% of
   the fauna are Neotropical. The best represented families are
   Entomobryidae with 58 species, Isotomidae with 26 species,
   Hypogastruridae with 23 species, Neanuridae-Pseudachorutinae and
   Paronellidae with 17 species each, followed by Tullbergiidae with 10
   species. Endemic species are especially readily found in Entomobryidae
   (26), followed by Paronellidae (9), Hypogastruridae and
   Neanuridae-Neanurinae (5 species each). Only Collembola from Cuba,
   Puerto Rico, Guadeloupe and Martinique seem to be rather well known.
   Collembola of the West Indies insular arch might have originated by
   dispersal on and above the sea, especially from the South American
   continent. In fact these little Hexapoda are readily transported by
   transoceanic rafts and wind, since some Collembola have been collected
   in aerian plankton, up to an altitude of 2000 m. The latest colonists
   must have been introduced by human activities. Collembola from the
   Greater Antilles differ much from those of the Lesser Antilles. As
   nearly all insular populations of Collembola are small, they are usually
   subjected to stronger human activities such as habitat destruction
   through urbanization and human overpopulation, as well as agri- and
   horticulture with accompanying introductions of alien species. All this
   brings about biodiversity impoverishment.

   - вест-индские (12%), 14 с материковой Америки (6,5%), 7 -
   пантропические (3%), а 10 - общие с Европой, Азией или Голарктикой.
   Всего неотропические элементы составляют до 72% фауны. Самые богатые
   семейства (или лучше других изученные) - это Entomobryidae с 58 видами,
   Isotomidae с 26 видами, Hypogastruridae с 23,
   Neanuridae-Pseudachorutinae и Paronellidae, каждое с 17 видами, а также
   Tullbergiidae с 10 видами. Эндемичных видов больше всего среди
   Entomobryidae (26), потом следуют Paronellidae (9), Hypogastruridae и
   Neanuridae-Neanurinae (по 5 видов в каждом). Лишь фауны коллембол Кубы,
   Пуэрто-Рико, Гваделупы и Мартиники, верояно, можно признать сравнительно
   хорошо известными, но с креном в сторону отдельных наиболее полно
   изученных групп, таких как Entomobryidae с Больших Антильских и
   Виргинских островов, а также Poduromorpha и Isotomidae с Малых
   Антильских островов. Население коллембол островной дуги Вест-Индии могло
   возникнуть в результате расселения по поверности моря и над ним, в
   основном, из Южной Америки. В действительности эти мелкие гексаподы
   легко переносятся трансокеаническими «рафтерами» и ветрами, т.к. многие
   коллемболы были собраны в воздушном «планктоне» вплоть до высоты в 2000
   м. Самые последние колонисты прибыли, очевидно, благодаря деятельности
   человека. Collembola Больших Антиллов сильно отличаются от таковых Малых
   Антиллов. Поскольку все островные популяции коллембол невелики, они
   обычно сильнее подвержены воздействию в виде разрушения биотопов путем
   урбанизации и перенаселения людьми, а также их сельско- и
   садово-хозяйственной деятельности с сопутствующими вселениями чужеродных
   видов. Всё это приводит к обеднению биоразнообразия.

AB Many least-wealthy, rural, remote and resource-poor small island
   communities are unlikely to benefit from high-profile global water
   improvement initiatives. Their small landmasses, geologic composition,
   geography, social and technological isolation, colonial history, and
   weak educational and financial resources constitute significant barriers
   to improving access to safe drinking water. This paper discusses the
   relatively unique position of such island societies in the international
   community, providing a case study of the Federated States of Micronesia
   that integrates data and information pertaining to water resources
   management and governance, spanning from the island village to national
   scale. A vision is offered regarding the interaction between small
   island human and biophysical water systems, manifesting ways to pursue
   water resource development to improve public health which are
   constructed to be economically, physically and culturally sustainable.

   monkeys living either in the wild or in captive colonies derived from
   the wild populations on the island of St. Kitts in the Eastern
   Caribbean. All measures were taken during the same week, eliminating
   bias that might result from changing seasonal environmental conditions.
   Vervets on St. Kitts are all descended from a small number of
   individuals brought to the island approximately 400 years ago from West
   Africa, thus eliminating bias that might result from subspecific size
   differences. We conducted a principal components analysis (PCA) and
   compared individual traits between captive and wild adult animals.
   Morphological measures such as body, arm, and leg length did not differ
   significantly between animals living in the wild and animals in
   captivity. Weight and measures indicating condition-including body mass
   index (BMI), chest, thigh, and upper arm girth were all higher for
   animals living in captivity. More consistent available food is probably
   the cause of differences in measures reflecting condition.

   vestimentifera Blake, 1985. The currently used name Hesiospina similis
   (Hessle, 1925) is treated as a junior synonym of both Hesiospina
   aurantiaca and Castalia longicornis Sars, 1862. A lectotype is
   designated for H. aurantiaca, and the same specimen is used as neotype
   for C. longicornis, making the two objective synonyms. Hesiospina
   aurantiaca is widely distributed and recorded from the Caribbean, Gulf
   of Mexico, European Atlantic and Mediterranean waters, Japan, Papua New
   Guinea, the Great Barrier Reef, and New Caledonia, mainly from shallow
   waters, but down to over 500 m depth. Whereas there are some differences
   between populations from different regions, including distribution of
   uni- and bidentate chaetae, the different populations are not
   characterized by any obvious apomorphies and are treated as a single
   species. Hesiospina vestimentifera is associated with hydrothermal vents
   and is widely distributed in the east Pacific.

   on coral reefs in three areas of its range: the Solomon Islands (Russell
   and Florida Islands), Papua New Guinea (Milne Bay Province), and Borneo,
   Malaysia (Mabul, Kapalai, and Sipadan). Using remote video for periods
   up to 55 h, we monitored diel behavior of adults (to 57 cm TL) at their
   burrow entrances. A customized miniature underwater video endoscope
   enabled us to view inside the burrows. Yolk-sac stage larvae (6-7 mm TL)
   and planktivorous juveniles (7-11 mm TL) are site-attached. At dawn
   young emerged from their burrows in swarms of dozens to thousands.
   Larval swarms stayed close to their burrow entrance, but swarms of
   juveniles swam away to feed on plankton. Juveniles resemble the
   sympatric, venomous catfish, Plotosus lineatus (Plotosidae), in
   appearance and unique swarming behavior. During the day, adult
   Pholidichthys leucotaenia excavated and cleaned their burrows by
   spitting out sand and rubble at the entrance. At dusk larvae and
   juveniles retired into their home burrows with two or three adults. None
   emerged from burrows at night. Clusters of larvae or juveniles hung from
   the burrow ceiling by mucus secreted from glands on their heads and
   often were scooped into mouths of adults and then released apparently
   unharmed. The food source of adult P. leucotaenia remains unknown. An
   undescribed galeommatid bivalve lives in the fish's burrows but
   apparently is not their food source. Our specimens raised at Mote Marine
   Laboratory on standard fish food showed strong asymmetry in color
   pat-terns during development to the adult stage.

AB The ram's horn squid Spirula spirula is a unique deep-water marine
   organism whose life cycle remains enigmatic. Interpretations of its
   ecology and habitat preferences are currently based solely on dredging,
   on fishery data, stable isotope data and rare molecular genetic analyses
   of dead specimens. These methods form the basis to decipher
   phylogeographic questions of otherwise unobservable deep-sea animals
   such as S. spirula. Here, new morphological data from internal shells
   (specimens n = 408, analysed n = 260) are presented from 12 different
   populations over huge distances, from the Atlantic, Indian and the
   Pacific Oceans. A monospecific status is assumed for Spirula, with its
   species S. spirula. The dataset shows a highly variable shell morphology
   including size distribution within distinct populations. Populations
   from the Indian Ocean are larger than those from the Atlantic and the
   Pacific. Specimens from the northern Indian Ocean (Maldives, Sri Lanka,
   Thailand) are larger than specimens from the eastern Indian Ocean
   (Mauritius, Tanzania) and the south-eastern Indian Ocean (western
   Australia). Specimens from the eastern Atlantic (Canary Islands) are
   smaller than those of the western Atlantic (Brazil, Tobago). The Canary
   Islands yielded by far the smallest specimens, while the largest
   specimen comes from Thailand. Specimens from the locality at eastern
   Australia (south-west Pacific) have an intermediate size range.
   Morphologic and geographic data suggest a geographically induced size
   differentiation within S. spirula. Preliminary findings on conchs mirror
   the known (from soft parts) existence of two sexual dimorphs in Spirula.
   The next step would be to collect more material from other localities. A
   more detailed morphometric approach based on specimens from which the
   sexes are known is required to enable a detection of the presence of
   sexual dimorphism by morphometric analyses on internal shells of
   Spirula.

   tuberculatus/Acanthopleura granulata (chitons), and body sizes of both
   Sparisoma viride (stoplight parrotfish) and Serranidae (sea basses and
   groupers) all indicate prehistoric overexploitation. Declines in total
   number of identified marine taxa as well as average trophic levels of
   exploited marine vertebrates suggest reduced species diversity and
   "fishing down the marine food web." These findings indicate that a
   relatively minor prehistoric human population (500-1000 people) can have
   significant environmental impacts, especially on small, vulnerable

   in whaling nationsat least those trends that are within the control of
   culture and society. The results of this survey support a challenge to
   the conventional theory that whaling is a dying form of artisanal food
   production by showing that the food products obtained through whaling

AB Tridacna gigas (L.) populations were sampled from 13 locations
   throughout the west Pacific in 1990-1491 and screened for allozyme
   variation at seven polymorphic loci. Significant genetic differences
   were found between the few large stocks of T. gigas remaining in the
   world. Cluster analysis identified two major regional groups of
   populations: a ''Central Pacific'' group consisting of Kiribati and the
   Marshall Islands, and a ''West Pacific'' group comprising all other
   populations. Within the latter group, the Great Barrier Reef populations
   were significantly differentiated from those in the Solomon Islands. The
   main routes of gene flow did not run parallel with known major surface
   currents as might be expected, but crossed them. Gene exchange was
   limited east-west between the Central and West Pacific groups and the
   GBR and the Solomon Islands. The lack of correspondence between the
   major surface currents and the routes of gene flow suggests that the
   genetic structure of T. gigas reflects historical patterns of migration
   that no longer occur, rather than present-day dispersal. These findings
   raise fundamental questions concerning the origin and maintenance of
   genetic diversity in Pacific faunas, and have important implications for
   the mariculture and conservation of T. gigas.

AB The Caribbean Islands are one of the ten insular biodiversity hotspots
   that are defined based on endemicity, massive habitat loss and
   vulnerability to extinction. Asteraceae genera endemic to islands have
   provided well known examples of plant radiation worldwide and illustrate
   the importance of these insular systems for evolutionary and
   conservation studies. A review of known patterns of taxonomic diversity
   and molecular cladistics is provided for Asteraceae genera and species
   endemic in the Caribbean Island biodiversity hotspot. We found that when
   compared with other island systems worldwide the Caribbean Islands have
   the highest number of endemic genera (41), have endemic genera in the
   highest number of tribes, and harbor the only Asteraceae tribe endemic
   to an island system, the Feddeeae which is restricted to Cuba. These
   unique patterns identify the Caribbean Islands as the most important
   insular area of endemism for this major plant family. Molecular
   cladistic studies are limited to only seven species in seven endemic
   genera and six endemic species in five non-endemic genera. These few
   studies are however relevant as: (1) they confirm the tribal status of
   the Feddeeae, (2) suggest colonization events from the highlands of Cuba
   toward low elevation and geologically recent areas of the Bahamas and
   South Florida, (3) provide evidence for biogeographical links to remote
   regions of the Pacific Basin, and (4) identify sister relationships with
   continental taxa, mostly from North America.

AB This paper is concerned with food security and access to land for food
   crop gardening among first and second generation migrant oil palm
   producers in West New Britain Province, Papua New Guinea. We examine
   changes in food security due to the rapid population growth in the
   presence of growing demand for land for oil palm production. Despite oil
   palm providing the major source of income for most migrant households,
   food crop gardening remains a primary livelihood activity, particularly
   for women, and especially so, during periods of low oil palm prices.
   Rising population and land pressures pose a threat to household food
   security and have implications for the supply of food to the rapidly
   growing urban population in the province. The paper begins by describing
   how household food security and access to land have changed over the
   past two decades. Then the paper examines how smallholder households are
   responding to shortages of garden land through the intensification of
   land use, intercropping immature oil palm with food crops and seeking
   access to land beyond the oil palm block. The paper also considers the
   role that research, agricultural extension and the milling companies can
   play in supporting strategies to promote food security among
   smallholders.

AB This document examines bio-physical limits of bio-fuels and
   bio-sequestration of carbon by examining available solar radiation and
   observed efficiencies with which natural ecosystems and agricultural
   systems convert that energy to biomass. It compares these energy/carbon
   exchanges with national levels of energy use and carbon emissions for
   Australia, Brazil, China, Japan, Republic of Korea, New Zealand, Papua
   New Guinea, Singapore, Sweden, United Kingdom and United States.
   Globally primary energy consumption (related carbon emissions) is
   currently equivalent to similar to 0.06% of the incident solar energy,
   and 43% of the energy (carbon) captured by photosynthesis.
   The nations fall into three categories. Those with primary energy
   consumption that is: 1-10% (Japan, Korea and Singapore); similar to 0.1%
   (China, UK and the US) and; 0.1-0.01% (Australia, Brazil, Papua New
   Guinea, New Zealand and Sweden) of incident solar radiation. The
   percentage of energy captured in biomass follows this pattern, but
   generally lower by similar to 3 orders of magnitude.
   The energy content of traded wheat, corn and rice represents conversion
   efficiencies of solar radiation of 0.08-0.17% and for sugar close to 1%,
   ignoring energy use in production and conversion of biomass to fuels.
   The study implies that bio-fuels or bio-sequestration can only be a
   small part of an inclusive portfolio of actions towards a low carbon
   future and minimised net emissions of carbon to the atmosphere. (c) 2013

AB To study the movement patterns of Green Seaturtle (Chelonia mydas)
   populations in the Caribbean region using Cuban habitats, tag-recapture
   data from local (Cuban National Tagging Program 19892002) and
   international programs (1959-2002) were compiled and compared. Of the
   742 turtles tagged in Cuba at fishing areas, nesting beaches and
   head-start facilities, 5.5% were recaptured, mostly outside of Cuban
   waters and with a majority of these (76.9%) off the coast of Nicaragua.
   Green Seaturtles tagged elsewhere and recaptured in Cuba included
   head-started juveniles from Grand Cayman (45% of the total), Mexico
   (2.3%), and Florida (1.8%); wild juveniles from the Bahamas (14.1%),
   Bermuda (5.4%), and Florida (1.5%); and adults from Tortuguero (26%),
   Florida, USA (1.3%), Mexico (1%), Venezuela (1.3%), and U.S. Virgin
   Islands (0.3%0). Recaptures of tags placed at sites north of Cuba
   (Bermuda and the Bahamas) clustered in the northeast region of Cuba,
   whereas those from the south (Grand Cayman) were recaptured in southern
   areas. Recaptures from Tortuguero tags were concentrated in the
   southeast and westward regions of Cuba. Turtles from the Bahamas, Grand
   Cayman, and Bermuda showed the highest recapture rates in Cuban
   habitats, with 3.2, 1.9, and 1.0% of the total number of tags applied,
   respectively. These results for a broad range of populations and across
   life stages underscore the regionwide significance of Cuban sites as
   critical habitats or migratory corridors.

AB In regions highly exposed to climatic variability and longer-term
   climate change, vulnerable communities undertake a number of measures to
   manage the effects of extreme weather events. Results from a survey of
   1059 low income persons in agriculture and tourism in Belize, Grenada,
   Jamaica and St. Lucia point to a need for a new balance to reduce risk,
   transfer risk, and effectively prepare for climatic stressors. This
   corroborates the findings from the IPCC Special Report on Managing the
   Risks of Extreme Events and Disasters to Advance Climate Change Adaption
   (SREX). This article seeks to bolster limited evidence to understand the
   consequences of these measures, and assess whether financial risk
   management tools could complement current asset-depleting approaches:
   The results reveal that the dominant responses to managing extreme
   weather events included: using savings (36 %), borrowing (12 %) and
   government assistance (9 %). However, one-tenth of the sample is at risk
   from 'doing nothing', which can contribute to loss of productive
   capacity and income sources, loss of access to finance, depletion of
   assets, health problems and social isolation. Study respondents
   indicated a need for alternative financial risk management approaches.
   The results also indicate a moderate explicit demand for weather-related
   microinsurance. Overall the results reveal that where vulnerability and
   exposure to extreme weather events are high, and capacity is low, a
   rethinking of risk management measures is needed to reduce loss and
   damage for low-income people.

AB Systematic description of the rich Lower Pliocene echinoid fauna from
   Yule Island, Papua New Guinea, and recently available palaeogeographic
   data from onshore Papua, the Gulf of Papua and Torres Strait have
   provided new insights into the origins of the extant tropical northern
   Australian echinoid fauna. Previous studies of echinoderm origins,
   hindered by a lack of fossil evidence, concluded that tropical northern
   Australian echinoderms were derived predominantly by Recent migrations
   from East Indian and West Pacific stocks. However, 47 per cent of
   species from the Yule Island fauna are extant in northern Australian
   waters, indicating that present faunistic patterns were to a large
   extent, in-place by at least the Lower Pliocene. Palaeogeographic
   evidence supports the earlier observations of H. Barraclough Fell, that
   migration of echinoid stock into (and out of) eastern New Guinea and
   tropical northern Australia probably occurred during the Lower to Middle
   Miocene, when widespread tropical to sub-tropical reef development
   occurred across a 5600 km belt from SE Asia through New Guinea and into
   the SW Pacific as far as Fiji. This favourable pathway for exchange
   between echinoid stocks disappeared during the Upper Miocene, when the
   onset of tectonic instability throughout the region, and the
   establishment of a discontinuous volcanic arc, resulted in influx of
   terrigenous sediments and may have caused the death of the reef complex.
   This pattern of sedimentation has persisted to the present.

AB Ocean warming is expected to impact biodiversity and fisheries in the
   tropics through shifts in species' distributions, leading to local
   extinctions and changes in species composition of catches. However,
   regional-scale patterns may differ from global trends due to the
   influence of important environmental factors such as ocean warming,
   fishing and habitat availability. Here, we used the mean temperature of
   the catch to test the hypothesis that, for the period of 1971 to 2010,
   regional variation in species-turnover of exploited reef fish
   assemblages among 9 Caribbean countries can be explained by differences
   in the rate of warming, species' thermal preferences, changes in trophic
   structure due to fishing and potential reef habitat across the region.
   Sea surface temperature and the mean temperature of the catch displayed
   rates of increase of 0.14 and 0.19 degrees C decade(-1) respectively, on
   par with the global average and higher when compared to the global
   average for all tropical fisheries. These rates also varied across the 9
   Caribbean countries, ranging from 0.04 to 0.18 degrees C decade(-1) for
   sea surface temperature and 0.10 to 0.62 degrees C decade(-1) for the
   mean temperature of the catch. The negative interaction between
   potential reef habitats in each country and sea surface temperature in
   relation to the mean temperature of the catch suggests possible
   moderating effects of available habitats on the sensitivity of fish
   communities to warming. In addition, the negative relationship of
   trophic level with the mean temperature of the catch suggests that
   fishing increases their vulnerability. Findings from this study can help
   elucidate factors driving variations in the sensitivity of exploited
   fish communities to warming, and have implications for the management of
   living marine resources in the Caribbean region.

AB A total of 3,559 flyingfish (Hirundichthys affinis) were tagged and
   released at three locations across the eastern Caribbean (Barbados,
   Dominica and Tobago) at the beginning of the 1988 fishing season
   (January and February) and at Tobago near the end of the season (May),
   to examine the extent and direction of their subsequent movements. A
   further 3,460 flyingfish were tagged and released at Tobago during the
   1989 fishing season, between January and May, to examine seasonal
   variation in movements. Overall recapture rate was 4.5%. Post-tagging
   survival was not affected by sex or by the method of capture at tagging.
   However, recapture rates varied with both place and time of release.
   Total recapture rates were highest for fish released at Tobago and
   lowest for fish released at Dominica. Total recapture rates off Tobago
   were highest for fish released near the beginning (January/February) and
   at the peak (March/April) of the fishing season, and lowest for fish
   released near the end of the season (May). Some fish remained in the
   release location for several weeks. However, there was considerable
   mixing of adult flyingfish among eastern Caribbean islands, with 10% of
   all recaptures being from territorial waters other than those in which
   the fish were released. This suggests that H. affinis in the eastern
   Caribbean is probably not segregated into island-specific populations.
   Dispersion migrations were recorded in all directions, although
   north-westerly was most common. Dispersion rate was not affected by fish
   size or sex, but varied with maturity state and time of year at release.
   Fish at maturity Stages 2 (maturing) and 3 (mature) showed greater
   dispersion than fish in Stages 4 (running ripe) and 5 (spent). For
   flyingfish released at Tobago, dispersion was greatest in the early part
   of the year and decreased steadily through the season.

AB Kuphus polythalamius (Teredinidae) is one of the world's largest, most
   rarely observed, and least understood bivalves. Kuphus polythalamius is
   also among the few shallow-water marine species and the only teredinid
   species determined to harbor sulfur-oxidizing chemoautotrophic
   (thioautotrophic) symbionts. Until the recent discovery of living
   specimens in the Philippines, this species was known only from
   calcareous hard parts, fossils, and the preserved soft tissues of a
   single large specimen. As a result, the anatomy, biology, life history,
   and geographic range of K. polythalamius remain obscure. Here we report
   the collection and description of the smallest living specimens of K.
   polythalamius yet discovered and confirm the species identity of these
   individuals by using sequences of three genetic markers. Unlike
   previously collected specimens, all of which have been reported to occur
   in marine sediments, these specimens were observed burrowing in wood,
   the same substrate utilized by all other members of the family. These
   observations suggest that K. polythalamius initially settles on wood and
   subsequently transitions into sediment, where this species may grow to
   enormous sizes. This discovery led us to search for and find previously
   unidentified and misidentified wood-boring specimens of this species
   within museum collections, and it allowed us to show that the recent
   geographic range (since 1933) of this species extends across a 3000-mile
   span from the Philippines to Papua New Guinea and the Solomon Islands.

   geography, the production systems, and resource distribution.  Atoll
   populations are grouped as dependent and independent, and demographic
   trends in population growth, migraiton, urbanization, and political
   dependency are reviewed.  Examination of the carrying capacity includes
   a dynamic model, the influences of the West, and philopsophical
   considerations.  The carrying capacity is the "maximal population
   supportable in a given area".  Traditional models are criticized because
   of a lack in accounting for external linkages.  The proposed model is
   dynamic and considers perceived needs and overseas linkages.  It also
   explains regional disparities in population distribution, and provides a
   continuing model for population movement from outer islands to district
   centers and mainland areas.  Because of increased expectations and
   perceived needs, there is a lower carrying capacity for outlying areas,
   and expanded capacity in district centers.  This leads to urbanization,
   emigration, and carrying capacity overshot in regional and mainland
   areas.  Policy intervention is necessary at the regional and island
   community level.  Atolls, which are islands surrounding deep lagoons,
   exist in archipelagoes across the oceans, and are rich in aquatic life. 
   The balance in this small land area with a vulnerable ecosystem may be
   easily disturbed by scarce water supplies, barren soils, rising sea
   levels in the future, hurricanes, and tsunamis.  Traditionally,
   fisheries and horticulture (pit-taro, coconuts, and breadfruit) have
   sustained populations, but modern influences such as blasting, reef
   mining, new industrial technologies, population pressure, and
   urbanization threaten the balance.  Population pressure, which has lead
   to pollution, epidemics, malnutrition, crime, social disintegration, and
   foreign dependence, is evidenced in the areas of Tuvalu, Kiribati, the
   Marshall Islands, and the Maldive Islands, independent islands.  Other
   areas with low migration, low growth rates, and minimal urbanization
   include the Tokelau Islands, the Northern Cook Islands, the Tuamotu
   Archipelago, and the outer islands in the Federated States of
   Micronesia.  Additional research is needed to identify and develop
   drought resistant and salt resistent varieties of trees, root crops, and
   other resources.  Fresh water areas need protection from overland
   latrines and irrigation projects, and construction projects. 
   Improvements are needed for regional cooperation and collaboration in
   industrial development.  Tourism and the export industries yield income
   but produce urban problems.  Addressing low growth areas with economic
   means alleviates spillover effects.

AB Water pricing policy is determined by multiple, though conflicting
   objectives. This paper analyzes flat water charges for households based
   on property values, using Trinidad as a case study. A major finding is
   that this tariff is economically inefficient and encourages water
   wastage which becomes environmentally unsustainable. Also, while social
   equity is a main objective in using this method of water pricing, in
   reality this is compromised. A key contribution of this paper is that
   water supply is regular in many countries where flat rates are used, but
   Trinidad consumers suffer from water shortages. The politics of water
   pricing and poor governance explain this anomaly in service, economic
   inefficiency, social inequity, and environmentally unsustainable water
   management.

AB Vagarious descriptions of species boundaries in jellyfishes have been
   attributed to inconsistent phenotypic variation between individuals,
   size-classes, populations, and species. However, the historical
   predominance of subjective and largely qualitative analyses of
   geographic variation has made it difficult to know where, if not in the
   analyses themselves, the real problems lie. Statistical analyses of
   morphological variation provide more objective and quantitative
   datasets. They also can be integrated with, for example, molecular
   genetics, geography, and paleoclimatology to provide an evolutionary
   perspective on biodiversity. Here, I illustrate some of the benefits of
   integrative statistical analyses of morphological variation in the
   golden jellyfish, Mastigias L. Agassiz, that inhabit lagoon and marine
   lake ecosystems in Palau, Micronesia. The morphology of Mastigias varies
   considerably between medusae, size-classes, populations, and
   environments and, although medusae generally showed location-specific
   morphologies, none of the variable features measured diagnosed all
   medusae from any location. DNA sequence data from cytochrome c oxidase
   subunit I and internal transcribed spacer one showed little variation
   and also did not reliably distinguish medusae from different locations.
   These results are consistent with post-glacial changes in sea-level and
   topography that suggest recent evolution of marine lake populations from
   an ancestral lagoonal form. Remarkably, many morphological features show
   greater variety in Mastigias in Palau than in all other members of the
   genus described from eastern Africa to the tropical South Pacific. Their
   morphological similarity, however, may mask considerable genetic
   divergence, as is the case for lagoonal forms in Palau and Papua New
   Guinea. There is, therefore, considerable heterogeneity in evolutionary
   process and morphological variation may be decoupled from variation in
   commonly used molecular markers. These results contribute to our
   understanding of inconsistencies in the taxonomy of scyphozoans and
   confirm that there is no widely applicable taxonomic standard for
   divining species. An evolutionary approach, however, provides a diverse
   set of tools for satisfactorily interpreting geographic variation for
   systematic purposes.

   long-range atmospheric transport (LRT) were identified and quantified in
   the atmosphere of a Saharan dust source region (Mali) and during Saharan
   dust incursions at downwind sites in the eastern Caribbean (U.S. Virgin
   Islands, Trinidad and Tobago) and Cape Verde. More organochlorine and
   organophosphate pesticides (OCPPs), polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons
   (PAHs), and polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) congeners were detected in
   the Saharan dust region than at downwind sites. Seven of the 13 OCPPs
   detected occurred at all sites: chlordanes, chlorpyrifos, dacthal,
   dieldrin, endosulfans, hexachlorobenzene (HCB), and trifluralin. Total
   SOCs ranged from 1.9-126 ng/m(3) (mean = 25 +/- 34) at source and
   0.05-0.71 ng/m(3) (mean = 0.24 +/- 0.18) at downwind sites during dust
   conditions. Most SOC concentrations were 1-3 orders of magnitude higher
   in source than downwind sites. A Saharan source was confirmed for
   sampled air masses at downwind sites based on dust particle elemental
   composition and rare earth ratios, atmospheric back trajectory models,
   and field observations. SOC concentrations were considerably below
   existing occupational and/or regulatory limits; however, few regulatory
   limits exist for these persistent organic compounds. Long-term effects
   of chronic exposure to low concentrations of SOCs are unknown, as are
   possible additive or synergistic effects of mixtures of SOCs,
   biologically active trace metals, and mineral dust particles transported
   together in Saharan dust air masses. Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB The second half of the twentieth century has been characterised by a
   major divergence in economic performance between small island developing
   states (SIDS), and nowhere has this been more marked than in the
   Caribbean. Countries in that region with the highest growth rates have
   been those with the greatest investment in tourism. The tendency
   therefore has been for governments to place an increasing emphasis on
   this industry, especially in light of the declining role of agriculture
   in the region. In Jamaica, tourism is a priority in national plans and
   the trend has been towards mass tourism, with a high spatial
   concentration on the coastal zone. The demands of mass tourism for
   natural resources and environmental services are huge and have not been
   calculated in the cost of the industry against which the economic
   returns are balanced. This paper compares the contribution of the
   tourism industry to gross domestic product in Jamaica with a preliminary
   estimate of the environmental costs of the industry, as represented by
   the hotel sector, taking as basic indicators the usage of fresh water,
   the extent of waste absorption and of carbon dioxide sequestration.

AB Two morphological types of Bacillus popilliae, causal agent of the milky
   disease, have been isolated from tare beetles (Papuana spp, Coleoptera:
   Scarabaeidae). B. popilliae from P. woodlarkiana woodlarkiana (Papua New
   Guinea) was a type A1 with a small sporangium (4.1 x 1.6 mu m) and a
   large spore (2.1 x 1.4 mu m) and parasporal body (1.8 x 1.2 mu m) that
   sometimes overlap. B. popilliae from P. uninodis and P. woodlarkiana
   laevipennis (Solomon Islands) was a type B2 with a small sporangium (2.8
   x 1.3 mu m), a small eccentric spore (1.1 x 0.7 mu m), and no parasporal
   body. The infectivity of these B. popilliae to Papuana uninodis larvae
   was compared with two B. popilliae samples from Popillia japonica in
   injection tests. The hemolymph of P. uninodis supported the germination
   and growth of isolates from Papuana and P. japonica. Results were
   similar in third instars and adults. Highest infection (spores present)
   and mortality was caused by the isolates from Papuana: mortality reached
   almost 100% 4 weeks after injection of the B2 type B. popilliae with 40%
   of larvae and 52% of adults infected. Injection of type A1 caused lower
   mortality but a similar percentage infected, Of two A1 B. popilliae from
   P. japonica, one caused a mortality comparable to type A1 from Papuana
   but lower infection; an older isolate resulted in low mortality and only
   one infected larva. B. popilliae type A1 from P. woodlarkiana was
   produced in the Solomon Islands by injection of spores in P. uninodis.
   Thirty four percent of the injected larvae and 31% of the adults
   produced spores with an average yield of 3.2 and 0.8 x 10(9)
   spores/insect, respectively. Oral application of a single dose of 10(7)
   spores of the B. popilliae isolates from P. uninodis or P. japonica did
   not cause infection and similarly inoculation of the food with spores of
   B. popilliae type B2 did not result in infections. However, when
   different rates were applied to the food of second- and third-instar P.
   uninodis, the B. popilliae type A1 from P. woodlarkiana caused up to 15%
   infection and concentration-related mortality. (C) 1999 Academic Press.

AB Aspects of transboundary, water shortage, and fisheries issues are

   Waters Assessment (GIWA) for the Pacific Islands. The region encompasses
   some 30 million km(2) and approximately 12% of the world's ocean space,
   and features great geographic, demographic and developmental diversity.
   Global change, especially sea level rise and sea surface temperature
   increases, is the dominant transboundary concern as it impacts all
   aspects of life. Water shortage and unsustainable fishing issues are
   selected for discussion, as they will dominate the region into the
   foreseeable future, and they are illustrated with examples from Fiji,
   Kiribati, and Tonga. The environmental impacts are exacerbated by
   socioeconomic issues such as high population growth rates, urban drift,
   the breakdown of traditional life styles and the rapid adoption of the
   cash economy. Policy options that may assist in addressing these issues
   are proposed.

AB Population structure and lineage diversification within a small,
   non-dispersive hammerhead shark species, the bonnethead shark Sphyrna
   tiburo, was assessed. Sphyrna tiburo is currently described as one
   continuously distributed species along the Atlantic continental margins
   of North, Central and South America, but recent genetic analysis of an
   insular population (Trinidad) suggests the possibility of cryptic
   speciation. To address this issue S. tiburo were sampled at six sites
   along c. 6200 km of continuous, continental coastline and from one
   island location (Grand Bahama) across a discontinuity in their
   distribution (the Straits of Florida), in order to test if they
   constitute a single lineage over this distribution. A total of 1030 bp
   of the mitochondrial control region (CR) was obtained for 239 S. tiburo,
   revealing 73 distinct haplotypes, high nucleotide diversity
   (0<bold></bold>01089) and a pair of highly divergent lineages estimated
   to have separated 3<bold></bold>61-5<bold></bold>62 million years ago.
   Mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase I and nuclear internal transcribed
   spacer loci show the same pattern. Divergence is similar within S.
   tiburo to that observed between established elasmobranch sister species,
   providing further evidence of cryptic speciation. A global AMOVA based
   on CR confirms that genetic diversity is primarily partitioned among
   populations (phi(ST) = 0<bold></bold>828, P < 0<bold></bold>001) because
   the divergent lineages are almost perfectly segregated between Belize
   and North America-The Bahamas. An AMOVA consisting solely of the North
   American and Bahamian samples is also significantly different from zero
   (phi(ST) = 0<bold></bold>088, P < 0<bold></bold>001) and pairwise F-ST
   is significantly different between all sites. These findings suggest
   that S. tiburo comprises a species complex and supports previous
   research indicating fine population structure, which has implications
   for fisheries management and biodiversity conservation.

AB Effective approaches for the prevention and reduction of obesity and

   store-centered programs represent one approach that may be both
   effective and sustainable. The authors developed a food store-based
   intervention in the Marshall Islands using qualitative and quantitative
   formative research methods, including a store usage survey (n = 184) and
   in-depth interviews with large-store managers (n = 13), small-store
   managers (n = 7), customers (n = 10), and community leaders (n = 4).
   This process was followed up by development and piloting of specific
   intervention components and workshops to finalize materials. The final
   intervention combined mass media (newspaper articles, video, radio
   announcements) and in-store components (shelf labels, cooking
   demonstrations, posters, recipe cards) and had high store-owner support
   and participation. High levels of exposure to the intervention were
   achieved during the 10-week period of implementation. This model for
   developing food store-based interventions is applicable to other

AB Observations made in Antigua indicate that children consume significant
   amounts of food between main meals. Some of the constituents of snacks
   are nutritionally valuable but much of this intake is undesirable and
   could be laying the foundations of ill-health. Continuing efforts in the
   field of education on nutrition are clearly necessary for both the
   children and their parents.
AB Protein malnutrition remains a problem throughout much of the Caribbean
   region.  In Antigua 5-7% of children are malnourished, and 15% of
   children aged 17-19% are obese and at risk for diabetes, hypertension,
   and stroke later in life.  Problems of malnutrition are exacerbated by
   the high cost of fruits and vegetables and nonnutritious imports from
   the US of fatty fast foods that are high in sugar, fat, and additives. 
   Nutrition education is introduced in home economic courses in schools
   and in parental education efforts.  The Caribbean Food and Nutrition
   Institute has a pilot education project operating in elementary and
   secondary schools.  The aim is to study the nature, extent, and quality
   of snacking among children aged 9-11 years of age.  The study involves
   20 children who keep a log of foods consumed in the course of a day. 
   Snacks are considered to be all food consumed between meals or after the
   evening meal.  Nonbasic foods are identified as those not fitting the
   basic six food groups.  Findings show that every child eats between
   meals.  60% of the children eat between breakfast and lunch.  41% of all
   energy is obtained from foods consumed as snacks between lunch and
   dinner, and 8% of all energy is obtained from morning snacks.  Principal
   snack foods include soft drinks, fresh fruit and unsweetened fruit
   juices, sweets and chocolates, sugar, and based products (listed in
   highest to lowest frequency of consumption).  Over 33% of daily energy
   intake, almost 50% of carbohydrate intake, and almost 66% of added sugar
   are obtained from snacks.  Daily consumption averages 61 g of sugar and
   ranges from 8 to 101 g.  33% of average energy intake is obtained from
   meals.

   with various states of the skeletal architecture as main synapomorphous
   (shared derived) characters. After examination of all available type
   species of the nominal genera of the family, the species groups are now

AB The flow path of the Antarctic Intermediate Water north and east of
   Papua New Guinea is investigated with use of hydrographic data collected
   in 1985-1986.  The most original form of the Antarctic Intermediate
   Water in the study region is transported from the Solomon Sea to the
   equator by a narrow western boundary undercurrent (New Guinea Coastal
   Undercurrent) flowing northwestward through the Vitiaz Strait and along
   the north coast of Papua New Guinea.  On the basis of this finding and
   previous studies by REID (1965, Johns Hopkins Oceanographic Studies, 2)
   and REID and MANTYLA (1978, Journal of Physical Oceanography, 8,
   946-951), which indicated that the Antarctic Intermediate Water crosses
   the equator in the far western Pacific and the major part continues
   northward along the western boundary of the North Pacific, it is
   concluded that the New Guinea Coastal Undercurrent plays an important
   role in transporting the Antarctic Intermediate Water from the South
   Pacific to the North Pacific.

AB Existing maps of satellite (free-air) gravity and bathymetry, and the
   CRUST 2.0 global crustal structure model have been used to make new
   Bouguer gravity anomaly and crustal thickness maps of the SW Pacific
   region to analyse the region's crustal structure. The new maps clearly
   outline the limits of the rifted, largely submerged continent of
   Zealandia. The Bouguer gravity anomalies of ocean crust, large igneous
   provinces and backarc basins vary simply and predictably with age. The
   bathymetric Fiji Platform lies in a water depth of <500 m and is some
   400 x 200 km in size. This is significantly broader than the nearby
   volcanic LauColville or TongaKermadec ridges. Prominent low Bouguer
   anomalies (+20 to -10 mGal) typify the Fiji Platform, New Caledonia and
   the northwest of Lord Howe Rise. Our analysis confirms a crustal
   thickness of >19 km for the entire Fiji Platform, comparable to
   stretched and submerged parts of Zealandia. The question whether the
   continental crustal thickness of Fiji is due to its actually being a
   rifted part of GondwanaZealandia or due to enhanced EocenePliocene
   magmatism remains open, but testable, with the latter more likely. Using
   the new accurate 3-D crustal thickness and published radiometric dating
   of lavas, we estimate that the magmatic portions of Southwest Pacific
   Cenozoic subduction-related arcs (three Kings, Tonga and Vanuatu) have
   grown at net volumes which vary from 263 to similar to 1400 km3 km1 with
   net addition rates of 1731 km3 km1 Ma1.

AB Biodiversity in the Solomon Islands is extremely rich, and in the
   Pacific is second only to Papua New Guinea. Despite this high diversity
   there are only rough estimates for the biodiversity of most taxa in the
   Solomon Islands. As part of a terrestrial biodiversity survey, we
   conducted nocturnal surveys for frogs in a range of habitats from 10-1
   060 m on Choiseul Island. This work was carried out between June 2005
   and January 2006. In addition to the nocturnal surveys, we also
   conducted opportunistic diurnal searches for reptiles as well as
   community environmental education and awareness workshops. Fifteen frog
   species (65% of all Solomon Island frogs) including all five endemic
   species, were found during our surveys of Choiseul Island. Most of the
   species were fairly widespread and abundant, however, four species
   (Discodeles bufoniformis, Palmatorrapia solomonis, Brachylodes trossulus
   and B. wolfi) were fairly restricted in their distribution. In addition,
   we found 20 reptile species during opportunistic surveys (30% of all
   Solomon Island reptiles including four endemics). Important habitats on
   Choiseul Island based on frog species richness and abundance are
   mid-altitude rainforest (500-600 m), primary lowland rainforest and
   lowland coastal forest. Unfortunately, it is these habitats that are
   most threatened by logging operations on the island. In order to aid
   biodiversity conservation on Choiseul Island we recommend a number of
   activities including additional biodiversity surveys, increased
   community awareness and education about biodiversity and the impacts of
   logging, and the drawing up of a management plan including all
   terrestrial taxa for Choiseul Island forests.

AB Killer whales Orcinus orca are considered to be relatively uncommon in
   tropical waters. Few sightings have been reported from the west coast of
   Africa due to a paucity of survey coverage. We present data on 32 killer
   sightings from tropical waters off Angola (N = 18), Gabon (N = 7), Sao
   Tome (N = 6) and Cameroon (N =1), comprising a combination of dedicated
   survey sightings (N = 21) and reliable anecdotal records (n = 11).
   Killer whales were reported from coastal waters, the shelf edge and
   deep, oceanic areas. Sightings indicate a probable year-round occurrence
   of killer whales within the region. Mean group size was 5.6 animals.
   There was no difference in group size between sightings in waters >200 m
   deep and those on the continental shelf. No photo-identification matches
   were found between Angola, Gabon and Sao Tome. Re-sightings of two
   individuals occurred annually in Sao Tome during 2002-2004. Killer
   whales had external appearance consistent with the Type A nominate
   species form. Antagonistic encounters were recorded between killer
   whales and humpback whales Megaptera novaeangliae off Angola, Gabon and
   Cameroon, and with sperm whales Physeter macrocephalus off Angola.
   Predation on ocean sunfish Mola mola was recorded in Sao Tome, and
   possible predation on sharks was recorded twice in Gabon.

AB This revision completes a taxonomic survey of fireflies (Coleoptera:
   Lampyridae) in the area encompassed by Australia, the Republic of Palau,
   Federated States of Micronesia, Papua New Guinea, Indonesia (West
   Irian/Papua), Solomon Islands, New Caledonia, Vanuatu and Fiji. It
   finalises the taxonomic issues arising from the 1969-70 voyage of the
   scientific vessel Alpha Helix to New Guinea. The firefly fauna of this
   area is exclusively Luciolinae. The scope of the revision was extended
   to include all known Luciolinae genera and certain species from SE Asia,
   and a phylogenetic analysis of 436 morphological characters of males,
   females, and associated larvae includes 142 Luciolinae species
   (Ballantyne & Lambkin 2009, and Fu et al. 2012a). The phylogenetic
   analyses infer four major groups within the Luciolinae. The monotypic
   Missimia Ballantyne is sister to all remaining Luciolinae and forms a
   grade to Aquatica Fu et Ballantyne. The large clade of Curtos
   Motschulsky, Photuroluciola Pic, Colophotia Motschulsky, Poluninius gen.
   nov., Pyrophanes Olivier, Pteroptyx s. str. Olivier, Medeopteryx gen.
   nov., Trisinuata gen. nov., and Australoluciola gen. nov. forms a grade
   to the clade of Luciola s. str. Laporte (including Bourgeoisia Olivier).
   The monotypic Emeia Fu et al. forms a grade with a clade of Luciola and
   Pygoluciola Wittmer, sister to a large clade of Convexa Ballantyne,
   Pacifica gen. nov., Magnalata Ballantyne, Lloydiella Ballantyne,
   Asymmetricata Ballantyne, Pygatyphella s. str. Ballantyne, Atyphella
   Olliff, Aquilonia Ballantyne, and Gilvainsula Ballantyne. Luciola is
   paraphyletic, found in up to six clades across the tree. Together with
   Luciola, Magnalata, Aquilonia, and Gilvainsula render Atyphella
   paraphyletic. The new genera described here are all monophyletic and
   supported in the phylogenetic analyses that also provide evidence for
   the inclusion of taxa within them. Twenty-three genera including five
   new ones, and ten new species, are recognised and keys are presented for
   the males and females. Certain females are characterised by the nature
   of their bursa plates.
   Australoluciola gen. nov. is proposed for ten species from Australia and
   New Guinea, seven transferred from Luciola and three new, with species
   keyed from males, all of which have an entire light organ in ventrite 7.
   Aus. anthracina (Olivier), Aus. aspera (Olivier), Aus. australis (F.),
   Aus. flavicollis (MacLeay), Aus. foveicollis (Olivier), Aus. nigra
   (Olivier) and Aus. orapallida (Ballantyne) are transferred from Luciola
   with males assigned to Aus. aspera( Olivier), and a lectotype designated
   for Luciola foveicollis Olivier; Aus. baduria sp. nov., Aus. fuscamagna
   sp. nov., Aus. fuscaparva sp. nov., Aus. japenensis sp. nov. and Aus.
   pharusaurea sp. nov. are described. Females of Aus. australis and Aus.
   flavicollis have two pairs of wide bursa plates.
   The bent-winged fireflies of New Guinea and Australia are removed from
   Pteroptyx Olivier and assigned to Medeopteryx gen. nov. and Trisinuata
   gen. nov. Medeopteryx gen. nov. is erected for 17 species including two
   new; all have ventrite 7 with an entire light organ, trisinuate
   posterior margin and short posterolateral projections; the following 14
   species in which males have deflexed elytral apices are transferred from
   Pteroptyx Olivier: M. amilae (Sat), M. antennata (Olivier), M. corusca
   (Ballantyne), M. cribellata (Olivier), M. effulgens (Ballantyne), M.
   elucens (Ballantyne), M. flagrans (Ballantyne), M. fulminea
   (Ballantyne), M. hanedai (Ballantyne), M. platygaster (Lea), M.
   similisantennata( Ballantyne), M. sublustris (Ballantyne), M. tarsalis
   (Olivier), and M. torricelliensis (Ballantyne). M. clipeata sp. nov. is
   described. Two species without deflexed elytral apices include M.
   pupilla (Olivier) which is transferred from Luciola, and M.
   similispupillae sp. nov. A Lectotype is designated for Luciola pupilla
   (Olivier). Females of M. corusca( Ballantyne), M. cribellata (Olivier),
   M. effulgens (Ballantyne), and M. similispupillae sp. nov. have two
   pairs of wide bursa plates. The second genus including species in which
   the males have deflexed elytral apices is Trisinuata gen. nov., where
   all males have light organ in ventrite 7 bipartite and posterolateral
   projections expanded; it is proposed for eight New Guinean species: T.
   microthorax (Olivier), T. minor (Ballantyne), T. papuae (McDermott) and
   T. similispapuae( Ballantyne) are transferred from Pteroptyx Olivier, T.
   papuana (Olivier) previously known only from a female, has males
   associated and is transferred from Luciola, and T. caudabifurca sp.
   nov., T. dimidiata sp. nov. and T. apicula sp. nov. are described.
   Females of T. similispapuae (Ballantyne) have two pairs of wide bursa
   plates.
   Luciola s. str. is defined by scoring the type species L. italica (L),
   Bourgeoisia Olivier and Lampyroidea (based on its type species syriaca
   Costa) both of which are submerged into Luciola; Luciola s. str is
   addressed here from four Pacific Island species: L. hypocrita Olivier,
   L. antipodum Bourgeois both transferred from Bourgeoisia; L.
   aquilaclarasp. nov. and L. oculofissa sp. nov. are described. L.
   oculofissa sp. nov. is the only Luciolinae male known to lack light
   organs. Females of L. italica and L. hypocrita lack bursa plates.
   Pacifica gen. nov. is proposed for five species from the Solomon Islands
   transferred from Pygatyphella( Ballantyne), and which the phylogenetic
   analysis shows to be distinctive viz. P. limbatifusca (Ballantyne), P.
   limbatipennis (Pic), P. plagiata (Blanchard), P. russellia (Ballantyne),
   and P. salomonis (Olivier).
   A monotypic genus Poluninius gen. nov. is proposed for Pol.
   selangoriensis sp. nov. from Selangor, Malaysia. The genera Colophotia,
   Pteroptyx, Pyrophanes, and Pygoluciola are treated in an abbreviated
   fashion with generic diagnoses, lists of, and keys to, species.
   Pteroptyx bearni Olivier and P. tener Olivier are characterised from
   type specimens and female bursae and P. similis Ballantyne is
   synonymised with P. bearni. Luciola semilimbata Olivier is transferred
   to Pyrophanes, and Luciola cowleyi Blackburn to Pygoluciola. The
   following species are treated as species incertae sedis: L. melancholica
   Olivier, L. ruficollis Guerin-Meneville. The New Guinean records of
   Luciola tenuicornis Olivier, L. timida Olivier and Photinus cinctellus
   Motschulsky are suspect. Fifteen of the species treated here are
   recognised by flashing patterns. The functions of the terminal abdominal
   modifications, origins of the Australopacific firefly fauna, and use of
   female and larval characters in interpretations of relationships are
   considered.

AB 1. Tropical, high islands of the Pacific have developed unique
   freshwater fish faunas that are currently threatened by a range of human
   activities. This paper documents distinct differences in life history
   strategies from fish communities found in streams of Fiji compared with
   fish assemblages in freshwater systems on larger continental land
   masses. While river systems of northern Australia and Papua New Guinea
   have a high proportion of freshwater residents, the Fiji fauna is
   dominated by amphidromous gobiids that migrate across a broad range of
   habitats throughout their life cycle.
   2. The number of amphidromous fish species and the number of all fish
   species in mid-reaches of Fiji rivers are significantly affected by loss
   of catchment forest cover and introductions of tilapia (Oreochromis
   spp.). On average, stream networks with established Oreochromis spp.
   populations have 11 fewer species of native fish than do intact systems.
   The fish that disappear are mostly eleotrid and gobiid taxa, which have
   important dietary and economic value.
   3. Based on the strong links between catchment land clearing, non-native
   species introductions and loss of migratory pathways for freshwater
   fish, spatial information was compiled on a national scale to identify
   priority areas for conservation in Fiji with intact connectivity between
   forests, hydrologic networks and coral reefs. Areas with high
   connectivity included remote, largely undeveloped regions of Vanua Levu
   (Kubulau, Wainunu, Dama, Udu Point, Natewa, Qelewara) and Taveuni, as
   well as smaller mapping units (Naikorokoro, Sawakasa) of Viti Levu with
   low density of roads and high relative amounts of mangroves and reefs.
   4. These priority areas for conservation can only be effectively
   protected and managed through cross-sectoral collaboration and
   ecosystem-based approaches. Copyright (C) 2009 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB Determining how ecosystem function and services are related to diversity
   is necessary for predicting the consequences of diversity loss and for
   setting goals and priorities for marine conservation. The consequences
   of biodiversity loss for ecosystem functions and services depend on the
   level of functional redundancy - the number of species with similar
   ecological functional traits. Using field data on fish assemblages from
   199 coral reef and lagoon sites from six islands, and on local fisheries
   from four islands in The Bahamas, we examined levels of functional
   diversity and redundancy within these assemblages and determined how
   fish biomass and local fisheries catches vary with local diversity. A
   majority of functional groups contain few species, suggesting that these
   assemblages have limited functional redundancy. Most also include
   species targeted by local fisheries, thus fishing has the potential to
   broadly impact food webs. Comparisons between a large marine reserve and
   fished reefs confirm that fishing significantly reduces functional
   redundancy and removes whole functional groups. Positive exponential
   relationships of fish biomass and fisheries catches with species and
   functional diversity highlight that even small declines in biodiversity
   may result in large reductions in secondary production and seafood
   provision. Taken together, these results indicate that Caribbean fish
   assemblages have low functional redundancy and high vulnerability of
   ecosystem functions and services to diversity loss, and that protection
   of multi-species assemblages is needed to maintain functions and
   services. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Both archaeological and isotopic data document dietary changes over the
   first five centuries of Western Pacific island settlement, a time period
   beginning with the Lapita expansion about 3000 years ago. This change is
   marked by a decrease in marine food intake and an increase in vegetal
   food intake occurring in the Late Lapita/ immediately post-Lapita
   populations. The recent discovery of human burials at Talasiu (similar
   to 2700-2600 cal. BP) in the Kingdom of Tonga opens new opportunities to
   assess this matter. We characterize the nature of the food items
   consumed by the Talasiu humans (n=21) using collagen and apatite carbon
   and nitrogen stable isotope ratios. We conducted an intra-Pacific
   comparison to examine the use of marine resources and the contribution
   of horticultural products and to look at the homogeneity of dietary
   practices within the Tongan group. Isotope results indicate a mixed diet
   of terrestrial and marine resources including a differential
   contribution of more specific marine foods (e.g., non-reef fish/inshore
   fish and shellfish). The Talasiu dietary pattern appears closer to that
   of the early Lapita population of Teouma than to other Late Lapita
   populations suggesting a different pattern of dietary change at the
   eastern end of the Lapita distribution. The slower rate of change may be
   due to the small size of both the island and the population, and also
   the additional potential role of social or cultural factors.

AB Hunting and invasive species are amongst the main causes of species
   extinctions on oceanic islands. On the island of Sao Tome hunting of
   introduced mammals (monkeys, civets and pigs) and endemic bird species
   has contrasting effects in terms of conservation. Hunting of introduced
   mammals may benefit native fauna and flora but pressure on endemic birds
   poses a threat to some species. We conducted semi-structured interviews
   with 119 hunters to assess the relative importance of native and
   introduced prey species, gathering information on personal profiles,
   preference and practice, and hunters' perceptions of trends in prey
   populations. Eleven species were hunted, including five invasive mammals
   and five endemic birds of high conservation importance. Based on species
   hunted, techniques used and final destination of the quarry we
   distinguished three groups of hunters, using cluster analyses: bird,
   monkey and feral-pig hunters. Bird hunters were all from urban areas but
   most pig hunters were rural. Monkey hunters were mostly rural workers
   but a small proportion were from urban areas. Bird and monkey hunters
   were primarily motivated by commercial gains but they also hunted for
   enjoyment and food. In general, hunting of mammals is an opportunistic
   activity that, if regulated, can be sustainable and contribute to
   mitigating the effects of invasive species on local fauna as well
   contributing to local livelihoods. Given the economic drivers involved
   in hunting of birds, intervention to reduce or eliminate this form of
   hunting will require enforcement of legislation and raising awareness of
   the issues involved.

AB Current models for the tectonic evolution of northeastern South America
   invoke a Palaeogene phase of inter-American convergence, followed by
   diachronous dextral oblique collision with the Caribbean Plate, becoming
   strongly transcurrent in the Late Miocene. Heavy mineral analysis of
   Cretaceous to Pleistocene rocks from eastern Venezuela, Barbados and
   Trinidad allow us to define six primary clastic domains, refine our
   palaeogeographic maps, and relate them to distinct stages of tectonic
   development: (1) Cretaceous passive margin of northern South America;
   (2) Palaeogene clastics related to the dynamics of the Proto-Caribbean
   Inversion Zonebefore collisionwith the Caribbean Plate; (3) Late
   Eocene-Oligocene southward-transgressive clastic sediments fringing the
   Caribbean foredeep during initial collision; (4) Oligocene-Middle
   Miocene axial fill of the Caribbean foredeep; (5) Late Eocene-Middle
   Miocene northern proximal sedimentary fringe of the Caribbean
   thrustfront; and (6) Late Miocene-Recent deltaic sediments flowing
   parallel to the orogen during its post-collisional, mainly transcurrent
   stage. Domain 1-3 sediments are highly mature, comprising primary
   Guayana Shield-derived sediment or recycled sediment of shield origin
   eroded from regional Palaeogene unconformities. In Trinidad,
   palinspastic restoration of Neogene deformation indicates that facies
   changes once interpreted as north to south are in fact west to east,
   reflecting progradation from the Maturin Basin into central Trinidad
   across the NW-SE trending Bohordal marginal offset, distorted by about
   70 km of dextral shear through Trinidad. There is no mineralogical
   indication of a northern or northwestern erosional sediment source until
   Oligocene onset of Domain 4 sedimentation. Paleocene-Middle Eocene rocks
   of the Scotland Formation sandstones in Barbados do show an immature
   orogenic signature, in contrast to Venezuela-Trinidad Domain 2
   sediments, this requires: (1) at least a bathymetric difference, if not
   a tectonic barrier, between them; and (2) that the Barbados deep-water
   depocentre was within turbidite transport distance of the Early
   Palaeogene orogenic source areas of western Venezuela and/or Colombia.
   Domains 4-6 (from Late Oligocene) show a strong direct or recycled
   influence of Caribbean Orogen igneous and metamorphic terranes in
   addition to substantial input from the shield areas to the south. The
   delay in the appearance of common Caribbean detritus in the east,
   relative to the Paleocene and Eocene appearance of Caribbean-influenced
   sands in the west, reflects the diachronous, eastward migration of
   Caribbean foredeep subsidence and sedimentation as a response to
   eastward-younging collision of the Caribbean Plate and the South
   American margin.

AB The genetic population structure of the Caribbean stoplight parrotfish
   Sparisoma viride was analysed by means of allozyme electrophoresis and
   randomly amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) using blood samples from adult
   fish that were collected on the reefs of 5 islands (3 sites at Bonaire,
   1 each at Curacao, Jamaica, Tobago and Saba). All allozyme loci showed a
   single very common allele. Allele frequency differences among the
   locations were mainly found for rare alleles. Genetic distances among
   the 7 sample sites ranged from less than 0.0001 to 0.012. The fixation
   index (F-ST) for the allozyme loci was 0.0188. Pairwise single enzyme
   locus F-ST values were small, but some F-ST values differed
   significantly from zero. The allozyme analysis detected significant F-ST
   values between Curacao and the other sample sites. The RAPD data
   indicated high, but slightly restricted, gene flow among 5 geographic
   areas. Apparently, dispersal among islands is sufficient to maintain
   near-homogeneous allele frequencies. We conclude that the local S.
   viride sub-populations are relatively open and there is a high level of
   migration among them.

AB Nivanteredo gen. nov. coronata sp., a new genus and species from the
   wood-boring bivalve family Teredinidae, is described. Multiple specimens
   were collected off the coasts of Vanuatu, the Solomon Islands and Papua
   New Guinea, between October 2004 and August 2014, from both sunken
   driftwood and deployed wooden panels at depths of 240-773m. A
   combination of features identify these specimens as both a new genus and
   species, including: unique calcareous pallets distinct from those of all
   other previous described genera, featuring a central stalk that runs
   almost the entire length of the blade and a disk shaped periostracal
   awning adorning the proximal pallet; an elongated mantle collar,
   extending from the base of the siphons to the mid-stalk of the pallets;
   a distinctive and elongated auricle on the dorsal shell valve; a complex
   caecum (wood-storing organ) featuring a highly coiled typhlosole, which
   ranks as one of the largest relative to total body length among the
   family. Larval settlement on wooden panels placed at 441m represents the
   deepest distribution range of any known teredinid, which were previously
   thought to be restricted to waters above 200m. The discovery of
   Nivanteredo coronata, recruiting at depths more than twice those
   previously recorded for tereinids, raises the possibility of a hidden
   diversity in other deep-sea locations and suggests that previous
   sampling, which has largely been limited to shallow coastal waters, has
   skewed our understanding on the biogeography and distribution of this
   family. To aid future identification and systematics of this complex
   family, we produced a revised and updated appendix of both internal and
   external characters across the Teredinidae, including the new genus
   Nivanteredo.http://zoobank.org/urn:lsid:zoobank.org:pub:24216C86-CCB0-4B

   Ischnura aurora) and five Anisoptera (true dragonflies: Anax guttatus,
   Diplacodes bipunctata, Pantala flavescens, Tholymis tillarga, and Tramea
   transmarina). The damselfly Tanymecosticta sp. is known only from a
   single World War II-era extralimital record reported here for the first
   time. Breeding is confirmed for the six other species, which are widely
   distributed in the Pacific and often further afield. The frequently
   cited record of Pantala flavescens as being the first odonate and one of
   the first insects to colonize Bikini Atoll after cessation of nuclear
   testing requires verification. Additional surveys on many of the
   Marshall Islands not yet sampled for odonates will doubtless result in
   many new locality records. However, small island size, limited habitat
   diversity and water resources for breeding, and large distances from
   potential source populations contribute to an impoverished odonate
   fauna, and few, if any, species are likely to be added to the list. The
   six species known to inhabit the Marshall Islands make up the entire
   known odonate faunas of many other low, coralline islands in the
   West-central Pacific.

AB Fire-dependent pine forests in the Caribbean Basin cover extensive areas
   in the coastal plain of the Caribbean Sea and Gulf of Mexico and on
   several islands in the Bahamas Archipelago, Cuba, Hispaniola, and the
   Honduran Bay islands. These forests are high in conservation value but,
   unfortunately, remain mostly unprotected. Moreover, even though they are
   fire dependent, the use of fire for forest management often suffers from
   poor public perception and is prohibited by law in several countries. In
   this paper, we describe the fundamental links among fire, forest
   regeneration, and forest persistence in these ecosystems. We identify
   two general strategies based on the presence or absence of pine seedling
   adaptations for fire survival and describe management implications of
   these two strategies. We also introduce conceptual models describing
   fire, forest structure, and regeneration strategy linkages.

   of Barbuda is limited, this bat fauna matches those of islands in the

   provides ample roosting sites and access to freshwater in caves, bluff

AB The role played by various institutions in the domestic agri-food
   systems of Caribbean nations has become an increasingly important area
   of research and policy attention. This paper assesses the main policies
   that have been implemented in Saint Lucia's agri-food system over two
   time periods (pre-1950 and 1950 to 2010), and analyzes their influence
   on formal and informal institutions. Results suggest that rule
   convergence in export (formal) and domestic (informal) agricultural
   production systems displaced informal institutions to a lower position
   in the institutional hierarchy. This institutional change has reduced
   interactions between farming community members, with negative
   implications for bonding and bridging social capital in the domestic
   food production system. Collectively, these changes have resulted in
   unintended outcomes associated with the decline of many rural
   communities. Our findings highlight the need to better identify bridging
   institutions in Saint Lucia's domestic agri-food sector that could help
   support shared rule-making, the decentralization of power and reciprocal
   knowledge flows amongst policy actors. (C) 2017 The Authors. Published

AB Coastal resources co-management is a relatively recent development in

   Caribbean. There is much interest in co-management among government
   agencies and non-governmental organisations, ranging from consulting
   with stakeholders to delegated and community-based management. Resource
   users are less familiar with the concept. The Coastal and Marine
   Management Program (CaMMP) of the Caribbean Conservation Association
   (CCA) is implementing a project on developing guidelines for successful
   coastal resources co-management in the Caribbean. It is part of the
   United Kingdom Department for International Development (DFID) Natural

   of co-management initiatives in Barbados (sea urchins and Fisheries
   Advisory Committee), Belize (marine protected area and Fisheries
   Advisory Board), and Grenada (lobster and seine net fisheries) are being
   documented. Less detailed investigations are being done in other
   locations. The ecological and institutional analysis research framework,
   some preliminary findings and a few tentative conclusions are provided

   particularly disadvantaged. Management of the associated health risks
   and changing health service requirements requires adequate responses at
   local levels. Health-care providers are central to these responses.
   While climate change raises ethical questions about its causes, impacts
   and social justice, medicine and bioethics typically focus on individual
   patients and research participants rather than these broader issues. We
   broaden this focus by examining awareness among health-care providers in
   the Caribbean region, where geographic and socioeconomic features pose
   particular vulnerabilities to climate change. In focus groups, Caribbean
   providers described rises in mosquito-borne, flood-related,
   heat-related, respiratory and mental illnesses, and attributed these to
   local impacts of climate change. Their discussions showed that the
   significance of these impacts differs in different Caribbean nations,
   raising policy and social justice questions. Bioethics and public health
   ethics are situated to frame, inform and initiate public and policy
   dialog about values and scientific evidence associated with climate
   change. We urge readers to initiate such dialog within their own
   institutions about the context-dependent nature of the burdens of
   climate change, and values and policies that permit it to worsen.

   curvipes sp. nov. (Papua New Guinea). Spinosodineutes s.s. is
   distributed from north India, China and Japan to the Solomon Islands
   (Bougainville Island) and northern Australia. Morphological as well as
   paleogeographic data indicate that the ancestors of the southeastern
   species migrated via the Indonesian Islands, not earlier than the
   Miocene or Pliocene. They were inhabitants of lowland rivers and
   streams, still the preferred habitat of most species. Invasion of
   mountain streams involved modification of the male anterior legs.

AB Estimates of species diversity on coral reefs are extremely high, yet
   hidden biological diversity makes even these, underestimates. The
   morphological complexity in the Caribbean reef coral Montastraea
   'annularis' was originally interpreted as a single species because
   colony growth form was highly correlated with depth distribution from
   the coral reefs surrounding Carrie Bow Cay in Belize. This 'species' has
   since been re-interpreted from other Caribbean reefs as representing at
   least 3 separate species based on morphometric, genetic, reproductive,
   and ecological differences. We revisited the shallow water coral reefs
   in the Carrie Bow Cay region to test whether the 3 species could be
   recognized, and if so, what their ecological distribution might be. We
   have found that the 3 recently described species of the Montastraea
   'annularis' species complex can be readily identified using both colony
   forms observed in the field and morphometric analyses of the corallite
   wall, and that their abundance distributions vary significantly along
   depth gradients. Morphometric comparison with both colonies from Panama
   and results from transplantation experiments in Jamaica show consistent
   patterns in the morphological characters that differentiate species and
   growth forms and are useful in understanding the geographic,
   environmental, and genetic components of variability within the species
   complex. All 3 species have a broad depth distribution, but each species
   dominates in a preferred depth zone, suggesting a high degree of niche
   differentiation. Our results confirm the existence of hidden biological
   diversity in Caribbean reef corals and call for caution in future
   estimates of biological diversity on coral reefs.

AB Phytoliths and micro-charcoal from the Yombon Airstrip archaeological
   site in central New Britain, Papua New Guinea, provide the longest
   vegetation history record yet available for the New Guinea islands. The
   record begins about 35 kya with the first evidence for human presence at
   the site and, with the exception of the Last Glacial Maximum period, is
   continuous to the present. Three other sites provide supplementary
   evidence, including plant macro-remains, from the early Holocene
   onwards. The record is punctuated by a series of volcanic events, which
   are reflected in the vegetation record by alternating frequencies of
   closed forest and regrowth elements. Micro-charcoal is present from the
   oldest levels and fluctuates in frequency throughout the sequence,
   increasing substantially from the terminal Pleistocene-early Holocene
   onwards. This coincides with the first appearance of panicoid grasses
   and a range of potential cultivars including bananas and Saccharum.
   Increased levels of burning coinciding with the appearance of potential
   plant cultivars may indicate shifts in plant food production leading to
   cultivation from the early Holocene onwards. This compares favourably
   with previously reported evidence from Garua Island off the north coast
   of New Britain. The combination of trends in burning, vegetation
   clearance and appearance of potential cultivars on New Britain appears
   to parallel changes in the Papua New Guinea highlands at a similar time,
   and suggests regional similarities in subsistence and vegetation
   management practices from before the LGM onwards. Further studies are
   needed to clarify the timing and extent of these shifts across the
   region, and to provide a vegetation picture for the period before human
   colonisation of New Britain. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

   accounted for 84% of all foci. Highest rates of infestation were found
   in tires (38.4%) and drums (33.8%). For the development of integrated
   community-based vector control programs, not only should consideration
   be given to the larval ecology of Ae. aegypti, but also to the
   sociological significance of the various container habitats and the
   selection of control strategies most appropriate for their management.

AB Dinoflagellates in the genus Symbiodinium are among the most abundant
   and important group of eukaryotic microbes found in coral reef
   ecosystems. Recent analyses conducted on various host cnidarians
   indicated that Symbiodinium assemblages in the Caribbean Sea are
   genetically and ecologically diverse. In order to further characterize
   this diversity and identify processes important to its origins, samples
   from six orders of Cnidaria comprising 45 genera were collected from
   reef habitats around Barbados (eastern Caribbean) and from the
   Mesoamerican barrier reef off the coast of Belize (western Caribbean).
   Fingerprinting of the ribosomal internal transcribed spacer 2 identified
   62 genetically different Symbiodinium. Additional analyses of clade B
   Symbiodinium using microsatellite flanker sequences unequivocally
   characterized divergent lineages, or "species," within what was
   previously thought to be a single entity (B1 or B184). In contrast to
   the Indo-Pacific where host-generalist symbionts dominate many coral
   communities, partner specificity in the Caribbean is relatively high and
   is influenced little by the host's apparent mode of symbiont
   acquisition. Habitat depth (ambient light) and geographic isolation
   appeared to influence the bathymetric zonation and regional distribution
   for most of the Symbiodinium spp. characterized. Approximately 80% of
   Symbiodinium types were endemic to either the eastern or western
   Caribbean and 40-50% were distributed to compatible hosts living in
   shallow, high-irradiance, or deep, low-irradiance environments. These
   ecologic, geographic, and phylogenetic patterns indicate that most of
   the present Symbiodinium diversity probably originated from adaptive
   radiations driven by ecological specialization in separate Caribbean
   regions during the Pliocene and Pleistocene periods.

AB Tourism is vital to the economy of small island states like The Bahamas
   and is closely linked to fisheries. Fish is a protein source for
   tourists and residents, and both groups expect to catch and eat local
   fish. To adequately manage these dual demands, we need to know total
   removals of fish, as well as patterns of demand by tourists and
   residents in the past and present. Using a reconstruction approach, we
   performed a comprehensive accounting of fisheries catches in The Bahamas
   from commercial and noncommercial sectors for 1950-2010 and estimated
   the demand from tourism over the same period. Our results distinctly
   contrast with national data supplied to the Food and Agriculture
   Organization of the United Nations (FAO), which presents only commercial
   landings. Reconstructed total catches (i.e., reported catches and
   estimates of unreported catches) were 2.6 times the landings presented
   by the FAO for The Bahamas. This discrepancy was primarily due to
   unreported catches from the recreational and subsistence fisheries in
   the FAO data. We found that recreational fishing accounted for 55% of
   reconstructed total catches. Furthermore, 75% of reconstructed total
   catches were attributable to tourist demand on fisheries. Incomplete
   accounting for catches attributed to the tourist industry, therefore,
   makes it difficult to track potentially unsustainable pressures on
   fisheries resources.

AB Due primarily to limitations of existing technology, deep (60-150 m)
   coral reefs have remained largely unexplored. In 1989 I began developing
   the use of mixed-gas SCUBA and other 'technical' diving techniques as a
   tool for ichthyological investigation of coral reefs at depths of 60-150
   m, and have since conducted initial exploratory expeditions to the Cook
   Islands, Papua New Guinea, and the Palau Islands. These expeditions
   yielded over 200 fish specimens, comprising more than 100 species
   representing 20 different families. Among these are more than fifty new
   species, three-quarters of which belong to the families Labridae,
   Gobiidae, and Serranidae and the rest are among 9 other families. The
   number of new species within each family parallels that of the overall
   deep-reef species assemblage, except for Apogonidae with a, total of 7
   collected species, none of which were new. Analysis of specimens and
   videotape surveys of the ichthyofauna at one 90-m site in Palau suggests
   that as many as 70% of the species inhabiting this depth are
   undescribed. New species assemblages on deep reefs show comparatively
   low distributional overlap (both between different island groups, and
   between sites within each island group), suggesting higher rates of
   geographic endemism than for shallow-reef assemblages. Based on these
   and other observed patterns, conservative extrapolations suggest as many
   as 2,000 or more coral-reef fish species await discovery on deep coral
   reefs throughout the Indo-Pacific.

AB Climatic conditions that affect the interannual variability of Caribbean
   hurricanes are studied. Composite meteorological and oceanographic
   reanalysis fields are constructed for active and inactive seasons since
   1979, and differences are calculated for spring and summer periods to
   provide guidance in statistical analysis. Predictors are extracted for
   areas exhibiting high contrast between active and inactive seasons, and
   intercomparisons are made. Zonal winds north of Venezuela exhibit
   westerly anomalies prior to active years, so coastal upwelling and the
   north Brazil current are diminished. Rainfall increases in the Orinoco
   River basin, creating a fresh warm plume north of Trinidad. The
   predictor time series are regressed onto an index of Caribbean
   hurricanes, and multivariate algorithms are formulated. It is found that
   atmospheric kinematic and convective predictors explain only similar to
   20% of hurricane variance at 3-5-month lead time. Subsurface ocean
   predictors offer higher levels of explained hurricane variance (42%) at
   3-5-month lead time, using 1-200-m-depth-averaged temperatures in the
   east Pacific and southern Caribbean. We place the statistical results in
   a conceptual framework to better understand climatic processes
   anticipating Caribbean hurricanes.

AB We investigate household-level food security in the face of climatic
   change in coastal wetland-situated households in Trinidad and Tobago.
   These communities rely heavily, but not solely, on natural resources and
   agriculture for their livelihoods. Household data were collected for a
   representative sample of 138 households in the Nariva and Caroni
   communities. This included data on household adaptive capacity including
   socio-demographics, livelihood strategies, and social networks; exposure
   to climate change and climate-induced extreme weather events, such as
   floods and droughts; and sensitivity factors related to local access to
   services and infrastructure. Using ordinary least-squares regression
   analyses, we investigate influences of adaptive capacity to climate
   change on household food security in these 'at-risk' communities. The
   results suggest that household socio-demographics and livelihood
   strategies are strongly related to food security and that the level of
   food security provided by those two factors is reduced in the face of
   climate variability and disaster. Social network capacity of households
   does not have a statistically significant influence in the context
   studied. This is a valuable insight for community and national planners
   and policy makers both in this and in similar country circumstances that
   must consider food security in light of climate variability and related
   weather-induced impacts.

AB Eight species of butterflies are recorded from among four different
   island groups in Yap Outer Islands, Federated States of Micronesia
   (FSM). Five species (63%) belong to the family Lycaenidae; the three
   others to Nymphalidae. Hypolimnas bolina is the most ubiquitous species,
   being the only one recorded on all the islands. Ngulu Atoll, which has
   the smallest land area, also has one of the most depauperate butterfly
   faunas, with only two species recorded, but it is located between Palau
   and Yap proper, which host the richest butterfly faunas in southwestern
   Micronesia. Ulithi Atoll, which is nearest to potential source
   populations on Yap, has the largest number of species. Small island
   size, limited habitat diversity, and lack of sufficient host plants
   combined with distance from potential source populations are likely to
   be the main factors contributing to the small number of species on these
   low-lying coralline islands.

AB Caribbean coral reef ecosystems are at the forefront of a global decline
   and are now facing a new threat: elimination of vulnerable species by
   the invasive lionfish (Pterois spp.). In addition to being threatened by
   habitat destruction and pollution, the critically endangered social
   wrasse (Halichoeres socialis), endemic to Belize's inner barrier reef,
   has a combination of biological traits (small size, schooling, and
   hovering behavior) that makes it a target for the invasive lionfish.
   Based on stomach content analyses, this small fish comprises almost half
   of the lionfish diet at the inner barrier reef in Belize. The
   combination of lionfish predation, limited range, and ongoing habitat
   destruction makes the social wrasse the most threatened coral reef fish
   in the world. Other species with small range and similar traits occur
   elsewhere in the Caribbean and face similar risks.

   Oxynoe azuropunctata Jensen, 1980 are regarded as valid. Species
   originally described from empty shells are regarded as nomina dubia.
   Seven new species are described, four from the tropical Indo-West
   Pacific: Oxynoe kylei, sp. nov., Oxynoe neridae, sp. nov., Oxynoe
   jordani, sp. nov. and Oxynoe jacksoni, sp. nov.; and two from the
   tropical Atlantic: Oxynoe struthioe, sp. nov. and Oxynoe ilani, sp. nov.
   The name Oxynoe panamensis Pilsbry & Olsson, 1943 has been applied to
   eastern Pacific specimens, but was introduced based on material
   collected from the Caribbean; therefore, the new name Oxynoe aliciae,
   sp. nov. is introduced for eastern Pacific specimens. Species are
   delineated using molecular and morphological traits, as well as algal
   host and reproductive biology. Results from morphological comparisons
   are concordant with molecular and integrative species delimitation
   analyses, providing robust evidence for species hypotheses. As Oxynoe is
   one of the few groups specialised to feed on the green algal genus
   Caulerpa, which includes highly invasive species, clarifying the
   taxonomy of Oxynoe may inform efforts to predict community response to
   disruptive algal invasions.

AB Breadfruit (Artocarpus altilis) is an extremely important food crop of
   widespread occurrence in Papua New Guinea where it grows readily on
   lowland alluvial plains and fans below altitudes of 1500 m and where
   rainfall is above 1500 mm annually. While not a major staple food, it is
   a significant supplementary crop for food security and variation in
   diets. It is particularly important on the smaller islands and atolls.
   Seasonality is not clearly defined and is reportedly different from
   location to location. There are so-called wild and cultivated forms with
   much reported variation in seed size and content. Seedless cultivars are
   propagated through root cuttings or root suckers. Possible genetic
   variation has not been characterized. Accounts of seed utilization for
   food may have confused A. altilis with the breadnut (A. camansi).
   Breadnut is an aggressive pioneer species in re-vegetation following
   flooding and riverbank sedimentation and its main product is the large
   edible seed. Cultivated breadfruit trees come into bearing after 3-6
   years and can yield up to 700 fruits per year of up to 4 kg in weight.
   Latex and leaves have localized traditional medicinal uses and timber
   and bark are also utilized.

AB Mangrove ecosystems occupy different locations on Caribbean island
   coasts, ranging from open bays (fringe mangals) to totally enclosed salt
   ponds and salinas. On geomorphologically active coastlines, such as
   south Jamaica, systems are at varying degrees of maturity and
   productivity. Furthermore, because of system variability, the
   interactions between mangroves and associated marine systems, such as
   coral reefs and seagrass beds, are developed to different degrees.
   Community structure and productivity of a range of mangals on different
   islands of the Greater and Lesser Antilles are discussed. Forcing
   functions and levels of interaction with the marine environment are
   identified.
   The rational choice of management options must be based on the range of
   goods and services provided by the different systems; and a good
   understanding of their ecology is essential when choosing sites for
   protection, waste disposal, landfill, marina development and fisheries
   enhancement. Examples are given from current studies in Jamaica, St.
   Lucia, the British Virgin Islands and Trinidad, of a flexible management
   response to mangrove ecosystem diversity.

AB Species assemblages on islands are products of colonization and
   extinction events, with traditional models of island biogeography
   emphasizing build-up of biodiversity on small islands via colonizations
   from continents or other large landmasses. However, recent phylogenetic
   studies suggest that islands can also act as sources of biodiversity,
   but few such "upstream" colonizations have been directly observed. I
   report four putative examples of recent range expansions among the
   avifauna of Makira and its satellite islands in the Solomon Islands, a
   region that has recently been subject to extensive anthropogenic habitat
   disturbance. They include three separate examples of interisland
   dispersal, involving Geoffroyus heteroclitus, Cinnyris jugularis, and
   Rhipidura rufifrons, which together represent three distinct possible
   patterns of colonization, and one example of probable downslope
   altitudinal range expansion in Petroica multicolor. Because each of
   these species is easily detected when present, and because associated
   localities were visited by several previous expeditions, these records
   likely represent recent dispersal events rather than previously
   overlooked rare taxa. These observations demonstrate that both large
   landmasses and small islands can act as sources of island biodiversity,
   while providing insights into the potential for habitat alteration to
   facilitate colonizations and range expansions in island systems.

AB Probable associations which exist between airborne pollen and
   respiratory diseases remain underappreciated, particularly within the
   Caribbean region, due to limited research. In an effort to better
   appreciate these relationships, further investigation into local
   airborne pollen on a sustained long-term basis is required. As a first
   step, using a 7-day-recording volumetric spore trap, air sampling was
   carried out in the St. Augustine area on the Caribbean Island of
   Trinidad to expand the limited data presently available to allergists on
   local pollen varieties. This sampling was a component of broader
   research on the association between airborne pollen, Saharan Dust, and
   pediatric asthma. During the 2-year sampling period, several varieties
   of pollen were found and classified and are presented in this article.
   The photographic pollen image compilation created can be used as a
   baseline to further investigate the aerospora in Trinidad which can
   address the current lack of documented records of local airborne pollen,
   thereby improving local scientific knowledge in this area.

AB Projected population growth in Pacific Island countries, combined with
   their narrow resource base, declines in net food production per capita
   and growing reliance on imported foods, will increase their food
   insecurity. We examined whether policies requiring retention of edible,
   non-target catches by the Western and Central Pacific purse seine
   fishery could aid food security in seven Pacific Island countries.
   Estimated catches within respective Exclusive Economic Zones imply
   average annual per capita protein benefits from 270 g in Papua New
   Guinea to 25 kg in Tuvalu. Stability of supply is affected by annual
   catch fluctuations; the two countries with greatest potential per capita
   protein gains, Nauru and Tuvalu, experience a 50 and 20 % reduction,
   respectively, in supply in poor years. Access to benefits is affected by
   practicalities of landing port location, food distribution networks and
   communication links, particularly for countries comprised of many
   islands. Only five of seven countries examined, which exclude the two
   with greatest potential per capita benefit, have significant tuna
   landings directly into their ports. Specific policy mechanisms may be
   required to increase non-target catch access. While marine resources
   have a significant part to play in improving food security, use of
   non-target catch will not solve food insecurity alone. The tradeoffs
   between maximising economic benefits from licensing industrial tuna
   purse seine fishing versus the potential use of the resource for
   consumptive use, and the potential social impacts that may result, are
   critical national and regional policy issues facing Pacific Island
   countries.

AB Indo-Pacific lionfish (Pterois volitans and P. miles) recently invaded
   Western Atlantic waters, rapidly spreading through the Caribbean and
   Gulf of Mexico (GoM). Previous genetic analyses using the mitochondrial
   d-loop determined that populations in the Western North Atlantic (NA)
   region have up to nine haplotypes, whereas Caribbean populations contain
   four of the North Atlantic haplotypes. The genetic composition of GoM
   populations, reported here for the first time, could lend insight into
   the pathway of dispersal into the GoM and better understanding of the
   biogeography of this recent invader. Here, we determined the genetic
   composition of lionfish throughout the GoM and compared haplotype
   composition to Caribbean and North Atlantic regions. We found that GoM
   samples contained only three d-loop haplotypes that are common in the
   Caribbean and North Atlantic. The genetic structure differed
   significantly among the three regions (AMOVA: Phi(CT) = 0.062; p =
   0.001), but we found no differences between locations within regions
   (AMOVA: Phi(SC) = 0.005; p = 0.092). The composition of GoM samples most
   closely matches the composition of Caribbean samples indicating that
   Caribbean populations are the likely source of the GoM populations. As
   each region was successively invaded, a drop in haplotype diversity and
   changes in haplotype frequencies occurred indicating dispersal
   limitation across basin boundaries and founder effects within each
   basin. The lack of differentiation within regions indicates rapid
   population growth and unfettered dispersal within basins after initial
   colonization. We find no evidence of secondary invasions within samples.
   With well-established populations, the probability of detecting a
   secondary invasion is minuscule.

AB Settlement of pueruli of the western Atlantic spiny lobster, Panulirus
   argus, was monitored approximately every two weeks at three locations,
   from July 1992 to April 1994, in the Caribbean coastal waters off St.
   Thomas, U.S. Virgin Islands. The catch ranged from zero to 29 lobsters
   per collector per sampling period. The collector nearest the mouth of
   the mangrove-lined estuary site had the highest settlement rate, while
   the lowest settlement rate occurred on the collector furthest into the
   mangrove system. Settlement rates in the estuary site and at the off
   shore island site were not significantly correlated with lunar phase. At
   the far offshore site, settlement was greatest after the new moon.
   Although settlement occurred throughout the year, the rate of settlement
   was significantly higher in summer. The greatest settlement occurred
   between April and September and the lowest during October to March. The
   settlement rate in the USVL averaged over all sites, was lower than in
   Antigua and Florida, but higher than in Bermuda. Management of the
   regional spiny lobster fishery is complicated by excessive harvesting,
   declining habitat, destructive fishing methods, and a lack of knowledge
   of parental stocks. The use of pueruli collectors is suggested as an
   efficient technique to assess management strategies.

AB The Australian humpback dolphin, Sousa sahulensis, has recently been
   described to occur in northern Australian coastal waters. However, its
   distribution in adjacent waters of the Pacific Islands and New Guinea
   remains largely unknown. Although there have been few studies conducted
   on inshore dolphins in these regions, the available information records
   humpback dolphins primarily from the Kikori Delta in Papua New Guinea,
   and Bird's Head Seascape in West Papua. Research in southern Papua New
   Guinea indicates that humpback dolphins are indeed S. sahulensis, based
   on cranial and external morphometrics, external colouration and the
   preliminary genetic analysis presented here. A similar situation exists
   for the Australian snubfin dolphin, Orcaella heinsohni, where it is
   assumed that the species also occurs along the Sahul Shelf coastal
   waters of northern Australia and New Guinea. There are anecdotal reports
   of direct catch of Australian humpback dolphins for use as shark bait,
   coastal development is increasing, and anthropogenic impacts will
   continue to escalate as human populations expand into previously
   uninhabited regions. Future research and management priorities for the
   Governments of the Pacific Islands and Indonesia will need to focus on
   inshore dolphins in known regional hotspots, as current bycatch levels
   appear unsustainable.

AB The trophic ecology of Konaino Creek, a small mountain headwater stream
   draining rainforest in the aseasonal tropics on Bougainville Island,
   Papua New Guinea, was examined and a food web was constructed. The major
   source of energy in Konaiano Creek was allochthonous detritus, most of
   which had been terrestrially degraded to fine particulate organic matter
   rather than entering the stream as leaf litter. This line detritus was
   collected by the filler-feeders (mostly Simuliidae and also
   Hydropsychidae) which formed the dominant Functional feeding group
   (64.4% of the fauna). Thus filterers processed most of the allochthonous
   detritus and made the energy available to other trophic levels, rather
   than shredders (1.7% of the fauna) which perform this role in temperate
   headwater streams. Collector-gatherers made up 22.7% of the fauna,
   carnivores, mostly Odonata, Decapoda (crabs) and Hydrobiosidae,
   comprised 2.8% of the Fauna and grazer-scrapers made up 7.4%. The latter
   were inhibited by low instream production owing to heavy shading and the
   instability and abrasion of the substrate due to frequent spates. In
   comparison, the trophic ecology of the nearby, coastal, Bovo River (with
   a catchment mainly in rainforest but mostly cleared with introduced
   species at the study site) was quite different and it was dominated by
   collector-gatherers (74%) and grazer-scrapers (15%).

AB Lionfish (Pterois volitans), venomous predators from the Indo-Pacific,
   are recent invaders of the Caribbean Basin and southeastern coast of
   North America. Quantification of invasive lionfish abundances, along
   with potentially important physical and biological environmental
   characteristics, permitted inferences about the invasion process of
   reefs on the island of San Salvador in the Bahamas. Environmental
   wave-exposure had a large influence on lionfish abundance, which was
   more than 20 and 120 times greater for density and biomass respectively
   at sheltered sites as compared with wave-exposed environments. Our
   measurements of topographic complexity of the reefs revealed that
   lionfish abundance was not driven by habitat rugosity. Lionfish
   abundance was not negatively affected by the abundance of large native
   predators (or large native groupers) and was also unrelated to the
   abundance of medium prey fishes (total length of 5-10 cm). These
   relationships suggest that (1) higher-energy environments may impose
   intrinsic resistance against lionfish invasion, (2) habitat complexity
   may not facilitate the lionfish invasion process, (3) predation or
   competition by native fishes may not provide biotic resistance against
   lionfish invasion, and (4) abundant prey fish might not facilitate
   lionfish invasion success. The relatively low biomass of large grouper
   on this island could explain our failure to detect suppression of
   lionfish abundance and we encourage continuing the preservation and
   restoration of potential lionfish predators in the Caribbean. In
   addition, energetic environments might exert direct or indirect
   resistance to the lionfish proliferation, providing native fish
   populations with essential refuges.

   for the presence of vesicular-arbuscular mycorrhizal (VAM) fungi and the
   soil samples analysed to determine pH; percentage of organic matter; and
   Ca, Mg, K, N, P, S, B, Cu, Fe, Mn, and Zn contents. The age of the trees
   sampled, the altitude of each site, and its annual rainfall were also
   recorded. The significant correlations found between measures of VAM
   fungal infection and site characteristics varied between islands. For
   each island, multiple regression equations were developed to predict
   levels of VAM fungal colonization of the roots on the basis of site
   characteristics. Plant health and degree of VAM fungal infection were
   related; the healthiest plants were the most highly colonized.

AB Introduction: Although antibodies to the feline immunodeficiency virus
   (FIV) have been detected by SNAP assay in cats from St. Kitts, there
   have been no molecular studies to further confirm the infection and
   determine the FIV subtypes present.
   Methodology: Total nucleic acids were extracted from EDTA whole blood
   specimens from 35 cats, followed by quantitative fluorescence resonance
   energy transfer (FRET) PCR under a six-channel LightCycler 2.0
   Instrument with Software version 4.1.
   Results: Four of 11 stray cats (36 %) but none of 24 owned cats were FIV
   positive by real-time PCR. High-resolution melting curve analysis
   indicated that all four positive cats were infected with FIV subtype-B.
   Conclusions: This is the first molecular characterization of FIV
   subtypes on St. Kitts and the results confirm the high prevalence of FIV
   infection in stray cats on the island.

AB Despite recent calls to limit future increases in the global average
   temperature to well below 2 degrees C, little is known about how
   different climatic thresholds will impact human society. Future warming
   trends have significant global food security implications, particularly
   for small island developing states (SIDS) that are recognized as being
   among the most vulnerable to global climate change. In the case of the
   Caribbean, any significant change in the region's climate is likely to
   have significant adverse effects on the agriculture sector. This paper
   explores the potential biophysical impacts of a +1.5 degrees C warming
   scenario on several economically important crops grown in the Caribbean
   island of Jamaica. Also, it explores differences to a >2.0 degrees C
   warming scenario, which is more likely, if the current policy agreements
   cannot be complied with by the international community. We use the
   ECOCROP niche model to estimate how predicted changes in future climate
   could affect the growing conditions of several commonly cultivated crops
   from both future scenarios. We then discuss some key policy
   considerations for Jamaica's agriculture sector, specifically related to
   the challenges posed to future adaptation pathways amidst growing
   climate uncertainty and complexity. Our model results show that even an
   increase less than +1.5 degrees C is expected to have an overall
   negative impact on crop suitability and a general reduction in the range
   of crops available to Jamaican farmers. This observation is instructive
   as increases above the +1.5 degrees C threshold would likely lead to
   even more irreversible and potentially catastrophic changes to the
   sustainability of Jamaica's agriculture sector. The paper concludes by
   outlining some key considerations for future action, paying keen
   attention to the policy relevance of a +1.5 degrees C temperature limit.
   Given little room for optimism with respect to the imminent changes that
   SIDS will need to confront in the near future, broad-based policy
   engagement by stakeholders in these geographies is paramount,
   irrespective of the climate warming scenario.

AB The islands of Tonga, in Western Polynesia, lacked rodents prior to
   human colonization. During the past 3000 years, people have introduced
   three species of rats (Rattus). Seed predation by rodents structures
   plant communities in many parts of the world. Therefore, there is the
   potential for rats to have a significant impact on the regeneration of
   plant communities in Tonga. We found 53 husking stations-sheltered sites
   used by rats to strip inedible protective structures (husks) from the
   seeds they eat-on eight islands in Tonga. The stations contained 13,555
   empty husks from at least 18 plant species, but only 165 viable seeds
   and seedlings. These husking stations provide evidence of seed predation
   by rats. Determining the extent to which seed predation threatens plant
   regeneration will be important for conservation of native forest
   remnants. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The minute (adult size 1.3-4.8 mm) land snail species of the family
   Diplommatinidae in the Fiji archipelago are revised based on historical
   material and modern (1998-99) collections targeting limestone outcrops
   on the largest island, Viti Levu, and several smaller islands in the Lau
   group. The forty-two species (including 30 new species) belong to the
   genera Moussonia Semper, 1865, Palaina Semper, 1865 and Diancta Martens,
   1867, which are briefly characterized and keyed. The diagnostic
   structure of the inner lamellar system of each species is illustrated.
   All species except one are endemic to Fiji. In Viti Levu, the 12
   localities surveyed each had 1-13 (average 5) species of
   Diplommatinidae; ten species were each found at a single site only. In
   the Lau islands, five islands were visited, with 1-4 species per island;
   four species are known from single islands. The number of historically
   known species not recollected in 1998-99 (7 species), the number of
   single-site occurrences (14 species), and the numerous islands -
   including limestone islands - that have not been surveyed at all,
   indicate that the 42 species of Diplommatinidae currently known from
   Fiji represent perhaps only half of the Fiji diplommatinid fauna. Such
   numbers approach the diplommatinid diversity of Palau (39 described and
   more than 60 undescribed species), and surpasses by far the diversity of
   other South Pacific archipelagos of comparable land area (New Caledonia,
   Vanuatu, Samoa).

AB As part of the US Coral Reef Task Force's National Program to Map,
   Assess, Inventory, and Monitor US Coral Reef Ecosystems, a comprehensive
   survey of projects/programs monitoring coral reef ecosystems and related
   habitats (i.e., seagrass beds and mangroves) in the US Caribbean and
   Pacific was undertaken. Information was gathered on a total of 296
   monitoring and assessment projects conducted since 1990 in the US
   Caribbean and the Gulf of Mexico. Substantial gaps in monitoring
   coverage of US coral reef ecosystems were revealed through geographic
   information system (GIS) analysis of survey metadata. Although southern
   Florida contains approximately two-thirds of all marine monitoring
   projects found in the US Caribbean and Gulf of Mexico, we were unable to
   identify any ongoing projects that monitor coral reefs along Florida's
   western coast and off of the Florida Middle Grounds. Additionally,
   Florida is covered by approximately 1 900 km(2) of mangroves, yet there
   were only four ongoing projects that monitor this ecosystem, leaving
   gaps in coverage in the Lower and Middle Keys and along the eastern and
   western coasts. The Flower Garden Banks National Marine Sanctuary,
   located offshore of the Texas/Louisiana border, has an integral
   long-term monitoring program, but lacks a monitoring project that
   gathers long-term, quantitative data on reef fish abundance and certain
   water quality parameters. Numerous coral reef monitoring projects in
   Puerto Rico arc concentrated on the island's southwestern coast
   surrounding La Parguera, while far fewer monitoring projects are
   conducted along the northern and southeastern coasts and around Vieques
   Island. In the US Virgin Islands, the paucity of monitoring projects in
   large areas of St. Croix and St. Thomas contrasts with monitoring
   activity in three marine protected areas (MPAs), where 66% of the US
   Virgin Islands' coral reef monitoring sites were found. Only a series of
   assessments have been conducted at Navassa, a small, uninhabited island
   located 55 km west of Haiti and 137 km northeast of Jamaica. In order to
   better understand changes in coral reef communities and to produce a
   series of biennial reports on the status of US coral reef ecosystems,
   the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) is developing
   a national coral reef monitoring network. This network has already begun
   to fill some of these gaps in monitoring coverage through issuing
   cooperative grants to states and territories to build long-term
   monitoring capacity.

AB We characterized tsunamis from the 29 March and 5 May 2015 Kokopo, Papua
   New Guinea, M-w 7.5 earthquake doublet. Teleseismic body wave inversions
   using various rupture velocities (V-r) showed similar source-time
   functions and waveform agreements, but the spatial distributions of the
   slips were different. The rupture durations were similar to 45 and
   similar to 55s for the March and May events, with their peaks at similar
   to 25 and at similar to 17s, respectively. Tsunami simulations favored
   source models with V-r=1.75 and 1.50km/s for the March and May
   earthquakes. The largest slip on the fault was similar (2.1 and 1.7m),
   but the different depths and locations yielded maximum seafloor uplift
   of similar to 0.4 and similar to 0.2m. Tsunami simulation from
   hypothetical great earthquakes (M 8.4 and 8.5) on the New Britain trench
   showed that tsunami amplitudes may reach up to 10m in Rabaul, but most
   tsunami energy was confined within the Solomon Sea.

AB Small Pacific reef islands (including atolls and sandy cays) are often
   precarious landscapes for human habitation on the margins of
   sustainability. Formed mostly within the past 4000 years, reef islands
   are amongst the newest and most recently colonised landscapes in human
   history. Innovative strategies developed by saltwater peoples to
   successfully colonise and sustainably occupy these dynamic environments
   illustrate human ingenuity with implications for modern reef island
   communities facing the predicted impacts of global warming. As a prelude
   to future archaeological research, this paper presents a detailed
   synthesis of early ethnohistorical and ethnographic information on
   settlement patterns, secular and ceremonial site types, and social
   interactions of the Kulkalgal people who continue to inhabit the small,
   drought-prone reef islands of central Torres Strait, northeast
   Australia. These skilled navigators voyaged in large double outrigger
   sailing canoes across 700 km of seascape and possessed the most
   geographically-dispersed settlement pattern known for any Australian
   Indigenous coastal group. The Kulkalgal developed dense networks of
   social interactions and exchange relationships with their neighbours,
   especially the Eastern Islanders of Torres Strait and New Guinea peoples
   to the north. In addition to expressing historically-contingent
   socio-political relationships, it is argued that these networks formed
   part of a range of socio-economic risk-buffering strategies to offset
   the dry season impoverished terrestrial resource base (plant foods and
   drinking water) of reef islands. Kulkalgal settlement patterns were
   complex and flexible and designed in part to take advantage of
   super-abundances of marine foods and to accommodate the seasonal
   vagaries of terrestrial resource availability. They ranged from
   population dispersal during the long dry season to congregation during
   the wet season when crop planting and communal ceremonies were
   scheduled. Investigating the long-term emergence and development of
   these socio-economic arrangements presents opportunities for
   mutually-informative comparisons with the more established archaeology
   of Pacific atoll societies. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd and INQUA. All rights

AB Background: The World Health Organization (WHO) selected antimicrobial
   resistance (AMR) as the theme for World Health Day 2011. The slogan was
   "Combat Drug Resistance - No action today, no cure tomorrow" A six-point
   policy package was launched as a core product for World Health Day. It
   aimed to stimulate extensive and coherent action to overcome the many
   challenges presented by antimicrobial resistance.
   Methods: As a preparation for World Health Day, interviews were
   conducted with a series of key informants, mainly senior government
   staff, to assess their awareness of the topic and the interventions
   proposed in the policy package. Since the key informant interview
   methodology was used with a small number of interviewees, it may be
   difficult to demonstrate the validity of the findings.
   Results: Key informants from twelve out of fifteen countries responded,
   which included Fiji (n = 5), Kiribati (n = 1), Lao PDR (n = 2), Malaysia
   (n = 6), Micronesia (n = 3), Mongolia (n = 5), the Philippines (n = 5),
   Vietnam (n = 6), Vanuatu (n = 1), Solomon Islands (n = 3), Cambodia (n =
   5) and Brunei (n = 1). There was a total of forty-three respondents (n =
   43). AMR was widely recognized as a problem. Lack of a coherent,
   comprehensive and national plan or strategy was noted. Surveillance was
   often seen as weak and fragmented even where presented. Laboratory
   capacity was felt to be insufficient across all countries interviewed.
   The majority of respondents stressed the need for national and local
   plans to combat AMR including reliable estimates of the financial cost
   of combating and managing AMR, the need for legislation to control
   inappropriate use of antimicrobials in food animals and more serious
   efforts to promote Standard Treatment Guidelines (STGs) and Rational
   Prescription. Also, importance was highlighted of the need to include
   infection prevention and control (IPC) as a part of accreditation and
   registration of health institutions and programs to promote IPC to the
   general population.
   Conclusion: A coalition of interested parties at the local, national and
   international levels need to generate and sustain the political will to
   organize a more comprehensive, sustainable, and coherent approach to
   AMR.

AB The importance of wild meats for rural people is well documented in
   tropical forests worldwide. However, the case of oceanic islands remains
   relatively poorly studied. We assess the contribution made by wild meats
   to the diets of rural inhabitants in the Island of Sao Tome,
   characterize the relative importance of native and introduced fauna, and
   discuss the implications of wild meat consumption on rural livelihoods
   and on the conservation of the resident fauna. Using semistructured
   interviews, we assessed animal protein consumption in 10 communities
   (716 household-weeks), around the vicinity of the island's main
   protected area, Obo Natural Park. Fish and the introduced West African
   giant snail (Archachatina marginata) are the most important sources of
   protein for rural inhabitants, with wild terrestrial vertebrates being
   consumed by only a small fraction of sampled households. Significantly
   higher amounts of wild snail and wild mammal meat are consumed in more
   remote areas with poorer families depending more on snails, and richer
   households on fruit bats or introduced mammals. Although eaten in
   relatively small numbers per household, consumption of wild birds is
   widespread, thus when extrapolated to the island's entire rural
   population, this practice is likely to be unsustainable, particularly
   for endemic pigeons that are also commercially hunted. Our results
   suggest that rural populations in Sao Tome largely depend on protein
   from introduced wild species, with native and endemic fauna constituting
   less important sources. However, endemic birds and native fruit bats are
   extensively harvested for household consumption and constitute a
   commonly used resource that urgently needs to be regulated.

AB It is estimated that by 2050 as many as 75 million people in the
   Asia-Pacific region will be forced to migrate from their homelands due
   to the negative impacts of climate change. While many representations of
   Pacific Island communities affected by climate change emphasize
   helplessness, Pacific Islanders have been negotiating identities of
   empowerment and resilience in both political and cultural arenas. This
   essay provides an analysis of the messages that Islander performers have
   chosen to convey through three performance contexts: the 2.011 Water Is
   Rising concert tour, which featured groups from Kiribati, Tokelau, and
   Tuvalu; 350 Pacific's Pacific Warrior Campaign, including both the 2013
   Warrior Day of Action and the 2014 Canoe Building Day of Action; and the
   multimedia dramatic performance Moana: The Rising of the Sea, written
   and produced by Vilsoni Hereniko. Through these three campaigns, we can
   see that Islanders are actively shaping their identity in the face of
   climate change, choosing to be seen not as victims in a far and rising
   sea but rather as a sea of warriors with the power to rise up, work
   together, and make their voices heard in order to save the lands and
   cultures that they cherish.

AB Tsunamis are natural hazards that have affected the Caribbean in the
   past and are projected to do so in the future. In order to mitigate the
   devastating impacts of tsunamis, awareness and preparedness is critical
   amongst local populations. This study investigated the knowledge,
   attitude and practices of coastal residents in one Caribbean country
   (Trinidad and Tobago) about tsunamis. Fifty residents were interviewed
   in each of three coastal communities in Trinidad and four coastal
   communities in Tobago. Interviewees generally lacked basic tsunami
   awareness (< 20 % were fully aware of a basic definition of a tsunami,
   only 57 % indicated that natural signs in the environment could be used
   to foretell a tsunami's arrival, and 92 % were unaware of past tsunamis
   in the Caribbean). Interviewees possessed an attitude that was
   consistent with the popular saying/perception that 'God is a Trini' as
   (1) 46 % indicated that there was no or very little likelihood that
   Trinidad and Tobago would be hit by a tsunami in the next 10 years and
   (2) 57 % indicated that if a tsunami were to occur God will be the
   entity most likely to prevent the loss of life. There was a lack of
   tsunami preparedness by individuals as 93 % of the interviewees did not
   have an emergency plan for a tsunami. Overall, 85 % of the interviewees
   indicated that public education programmes about tsunamis had never been
   conducted in their community. Baseline data from this study will be
   useful in (1) evaluating the effectiveness of current tsunami awareness
   and preparedness efforts and (2) informing the implementation of new
   programmes which target existing knowledge gaps. Furthermore, it is
   envisioned that this study will also provide the necessary foundation
   for future KAP studies about tsunamis in other Caribbean islands.

AB Periodically-harvested closures are commonly employed within
   co-management frameworks to help manage small-scale, multi-species
   fisheries in the Indo-Pacific. Despite their widespread use, the
   benefits of periodic harvesting strategies for multi-species fisheries
   have, to date, been largely untested. We examine catch and effort data
   from four periodically-harvested reef areas and 55 continuously-fished
   reefs in Solomon Islands. We test the hypothesis that fishing in
   periodically-harvested closures would yield: (a) higher catch rates, (b)
   proportionally more short lived, fast growing, sedentary taxa, and (c)
   larger finfish and invertebrates, compared to catches from reefs
   continuously open to fishing. Our study showed that catch rates were
   significantly higher from periodically-harvested closures for gleaning
   of invertebrates, but not for line and spear fishing. The family level
   composition of catches did not vary significantly between open reefs and
   periodically-harvested closures. Fish captured from
   periodically-harvested closures were slightly larger, but Trochus
   niloticus were significantly smaller than those from continuously open
   reefs. In one case of intense and prolonged harvesting, gleaning catch
   rates significantly declined, suggesting invertebrate stocks were
   substantially depleted in the early stages of the open period. Our study
   suggests periodically-harvested closures can have some short term
   benefits via increasing harvesting efficiency. However, we did not find
   evidence that the strategy had substantially benefited multi-species
   fin-fisheries.

   Current literature demonstrates that different population groups have

   thought on the country's food security and effects on livelihoods
   persist. This article draws on evidence from research conducted in the

   of rural semisubsistence farmers to drought-induced food insecurity. It

AB Ocean temperatures are increasing globally and the Caribbean is no
   exception. An extreme ocean warming event in 2010 placed Tobago's coral
   reefs under severe stress resulting in widespread coral bleaching and
   threatening the livelihoods that rely on them. The bleaching response of
   four reef building taxa was monitored over a six month period across
   three major reefs systems in Tobago. By identifying taxa resilient to
   bleaching we propose to assist local coral reef managers in the decision
   making process to cope with mass bleaching events. The bleaching signal
   (length of exposure to high ocean temperatures) varied widely between
   the Atlantic and Caribbean reefs, but regardless of this variation most
   taxa bleached. Colpophyllia natans, Montastraea faveolata and
   Siderastrea siderea were considered the most bleaching vulnerable taxa.
   Interestingly, reefs with the highest coral cover showed the greatest
   decline reef building taxa, and conversely, reefs with the lowest coral
   cover showed the most bleaching but lowest change in coral cover with
   little algal overgrowth post-bleaching.

AB The relationship between energy drink (ED) use and risky behaviours has
   not been explored in the Caribbean, where youth risky behaviours are
   prevalent. This paper examines the relationship between ED use and risky
   behaviours and the moderating effect of gender among 1994 undergraduate
   students in Trinidad and Tobago. Analyses examined the association
   between ED use and risky behaviours, and the significant predictors of
   risky behaviours. Analysis of variance determined whether there were
   differences in risky behaviours between those who used only alcohol or
   EDs, both alcohol and EDs, alcohol mixed with EDs and neither alcohol
   nor EDs; and the difference between those with high and low intensity of
   ED use. In both males and females current use of energy drinks was
   positively associated with harmful substance use, risky sexual
   behaviours, and risky non-sexual behaviours, more strongly for males.
   The strongest predictor of risky behaviours was gender. Males consuming
   both alcohol and EDs, independently or mixed, were most likely to have
   risky behaviours. Consistent with previous reports, harmful alcohol use
   and other risk taking health behaviours appear to be predicted by a
   combination of high intensity use of EDs and alcohol. In countries like
   Trinidad and Tobago where violence, alcohol use disorders, STI/HIV
   infection and teenaged pregnancy are prevalent, the assessment of
   consumption of EDs and alcohol may be an important potential predictor
   of health compromising behaviours.

AB The Caribbean Sea hosts twenty-seven small island developing states
   (SIDS), some of which utilise their marine resources found in the
   Caribbean Sea for economic gains. Many of the economic activities such
   as tourism, shipping and industrial development are currently
   incompatible with a healthy and sustainable marine environment. Sewage,
   agricultural effluents and hydrocarbon pollution resulting from these
   economic activities have led to degradation of this large marine
   ecosystem. In in effort to address these issues; policies, programmes
   and multilateral environmental agreements (MEAs) were initiated in order
   to regionalise the response efforts. These include efforts such the
   Cartagena Convention, the integrated watershed and coastal area
   management (IWCAM) initiative and pollution assessment among others.
   This paper reviews the regional responses by the SIDS and other agencies
   in dealing with pollution from land and marine-based activities and
   biodiversity loss via these initiatives.
   The findings showed that the region lack the commitment needed as
   demonstrated by the poor ratification rate of major MEAs, disjointed
   programmes and strong political influences. These have proven
   ineffective in curbing degradation in the sea. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

AB In the Caribbean region, forereef habitats dominated by Montastraea spp.
   have the highest biodiversity and support the largest number of
   ecosystem processes and services. Here we show that the distribution of
   this species-rich habitat can be explained by one environmental
   predictor: wave exposure. The relationship between wave exposure and the
   occurrence of Montastraea reefs was modelled using logistic regression
   for reefs throughout the Belize Barrier Reef, one of the largest and
   most topographically complex systems in the region. The model was able
   to predict correctly the occurrence of Montastraea reefs with an
   accuracy of 81%. Consistent with historical qualitative patterns, the
   distribution of Montastraea reefs is constrained in environments of high
   exposure. This pattern is likely to be driven by high rates of chronic
   sediment scour that constrain recruitment. The wide range of wave
   exposure conditions used to parameterize the model in Belize suggest
   that it should be transferable throughout much of the Caribbean region,
   constituting a fast and inexpensive alternative to traditional habitat
   mapping and complementing global efforts to map reef extent.

AB Objective: To determine the level of understanding of the issues of
   climate change (CC)/variability (C V) and public health by populations
   of St Kitts and Nevis (SKN) and Trinidad and Tobago (T&T) and to find
   whether respondents would be willing to incorporate these values into
   strategies for dengue fever (DF) prevention.
   Design and Methods: Using a cluster sampling system, representative
   samples of the communities of SKN (22 7) and T&T (650) were surveyed for
   responses to a questionnaire document with questions on the impact of
   climate variability on health, the physical environment, respondents'
   willingness to utilize climate issues to predict and adapt to climate
   variability for DF prevention. Data were analyzed by Epi Info.
   Results: Sixty-two per cent SKN and 55% T&T of respondents showed some
   understanding of the concept of climate change (CC) and distinguished
   this from climate variability (C V). With regard to causes of CC, 48%
   SKN and 50% T&T attributed CC to all of: green houses gases, holes in
   the ozone layer burning of vegetation and vehicular exhaust gases.
   However some 39.3% SKN and 31% (T&T) did not answer this question.
   In response to ranking issues of life affected by CC/CV in both
   countries, respondents ranked them: health > water resources >
   agriculture > biodiversity > coastal degradation. The major health
   issues identified for SKN and T&T respondents were: food-borne diseases
   > water-borne diseases > heat stresses; vector-borne diseases were only
   ranked 4(th) and 5(th) for SKN and T&T respondents respectively. There
   was in both countries a significant proportion of respondents (p <
   0.001) who reported wet season-related increase of DF cases as a CC/CV
   link. Respondents identified use of environmental sanitation (ES) at
   appropriate times as a method of choice of using CC/CV to prevent DF
   outbreaks. More than 82% in both countries saw the use of the CCIC V
   information for DF prevention by prediction and control as strategic but
   only 50-51 % were inclined to become personally involved Currently, only
   50% SKN and 45% T&T respondents claimed current involvement in DF vector
   surveillance and control in the last two days.
   Conclusion: Despite the fact that knowledge and attitudes did not always
   coincide with practices of using ES for DF prevention, in both
   countries, even with CC/CV tools of prediction being available, it seems
   that respondents could be persuaded to use such strategies. There is a
   need for demonstration of the efficacy of CC/CV information and
   promotion of its usefulness for community involvement in DF and possibly
   other disease prevention.

AB Direct earthquake-to-station Rayleigh and Love wave data observed on
   high gain broadband records are analyzed in order to improve the lateral
   resolution of the uppermost mantle in the southwest Pacific region. We
   used data of nine permanent Geoscope and Iris stations located in the
   southern hemisphere and nine other stations as part of two temporary
   networks, the first one installed in New Caledonia and Vanuatu
   (hereafter named Cavascope network) by ORSTOM and the EOST from Louis
   Pasteur University in Strasbourg (France) and the second one installed
   in the Fiji, Tonga and Niue islands (hereafter named Spase network) by
   Washington University in St. Louis (USA). In order to collect more
   significant details on the surficial structures, we included the
   analysis of short period waves down to 8 s. A multiple frequency
   filtering technique has been used to recover phase velocities of
   Rayleigh and Love waves for selected earthquakes with magnitude greater
   than 5.5 and with known centroid moment tensor (CMT). About 1100
   well-distributed seismograms have been processed in the period range
   8-100 s and corrections for topography and water depth have been applied
   to the observed phase velocities. The geographical distribution of phase
   velocity anomalies have then been computed using the tomographic method
   developed by Montagner [Montagner, J.P., 1986a. Regional
   three-dimensional structures using long-period surface waves. Ann.
   Geophys. 4 (B3), 283-294]. Due to a poor knowledge of dense,
   well-distributed, crustal thickness values and corresponding velocity
   models, we did not perform or speculate on the construction of an S-wave
   3D velocity model; therefore, we limited this study to the
   interpretation of the phase velocity distribution. The location of phase
   velocity anomalies are well determined and the deviations are discussed
   within the framework of the geological context and compared with other
   tomographic models. At long periods, from 40 s to 100 s, our results
   agree well with most of previous studies: the tomographic imaging shows
   a large contrast between low and high phase velocities along the
   Solomon, New Hebrides and Fiji-Tonga trenches. The lowest phase velocity
   anomalies are distributed beneath northern and southern Fiji basins and
   the Lau basin (corresponding to the volume situated just above the
   dipping slabs), whereas the highest values are displayed beneath the
   Pacific plate and the eastern part of Indian plate downgoing under the
   North Fiji basin. At shorter periods, our results show that the phase
   velocity distributions are well correlated with the large structural
   crustal domains. The use of local temporary broadband stations in the
   central part of the studied area gives us the opportunity to observe
   surface waves showing well-dispersed trains, allowing extended velocity
   measurements down to 8 s although aliasing due to multipaths become
   important. The continental regions (Eastern Australia, New Guinea, Fiji
   islands and New Zealand) show Law velocities which are likely due to
   thick continental crust, whereas the Tasmanian. D'Entrecasteaux, and the
   Northern and Southern Fiji basins are characterized by higher velocities
   suggesting thinner oceanic crust. Additional analysis including the
   anisotropic case and S-wave velocity inversion with depth is in
   progress. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB This paper examines ways in which a coastline, specifically the swash
   zone on a particular Caribbean beach, serves to inform our understanding
   of liminal spaces. At the precise place where the landscape transitions
   from sea to land with each wave's ebb and flow, artisanal whalers from
   the island of St. Vincent unload their day's catch and begin the process
   of turning animals into food products. The shoreline can be seen as a
   space to which the marine mammals are brought for the purpose of a
   multifaceted transition, in which their identities, physical forms, and
   even status as living organisms are changed. By examining the specific
   transitions that occur in this space, and by questioning why these
   transitions do not occur elsewhere, this paper sheds light on concepts
   of land and sea, life and death, and the gendering of space all of which
   undergo a defined transition at the water's edge on this particular
   coastline. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Successful invasions are largely explained by some combination of enemy
   release, where the invader escapes its natural enemies from its native
   range, and low biotic resistance, where native species in the introduced
   range fail to control the invader. We examined the extent to which
   parasites may mediate both release and resistance in the introduction of
   Pacific red lionfish (Pterois volitans) to Atlantic coral reefs. We
   found that fewer lionfish were parasitized at two regions in their
   introduced Atlantic range (The Bahamas and the Cayman Islands) than at
   two regions in their native Pacific range (the Northern Marianas Islands
   and the Philippines). This pattern was largely driven by relatively high
   infection rates of lionfish by didymozoan fluke worms and parasitic
   copepods (which may be host-specific to Pterois lionfishes) in the
   Marianas and the Philippines, respectively. When compared with
   sympatric, native fishes in the Atlantic, invasive lionfish were at
   least 18 times less likely to host a parasite in The Bahamas and at
   least 40 times less likely to host a parasite in the Cayman Islands. We
   found no indication that lionfish introduced Pacific parasites into the
   Atlantic. In conjunction with demographic signs of enemy release such as
   increased density, fish size, and growth of invasive lionfish, it is
   possible that escape from parasites may have contributed to the success
   of lionfish. This is especially true if future studies reveal that such
   a loss of parasites has led to more energy available for lionfish
   growth, reproduction, and/or immunity.

AB The Lapita colonization of Remote Oceania involved rapid expansion from
   New Guinea across one-tenth of the circumference of the earth. Implicit
   in most discussions of this phenomenon is a standard wave-of-advance
   model founded on demographic growth and the economic advantage provided
   by food production. The Lapita movement is also routinely embedded
   within a much larger narrative of the expansion of Austronesian
   languages and peoples out of Southeast Asia into Island Melanesia and
   ultimately east through East Polynesia. Although this simple narrative
   is very attractive, as more data become available, the details of
   segments of the "Austronesian" expansion require revision in order to
   reconcile the data from archaeology, linguistics, and biology. This
   paper looks closely at recent data on the Lapita portion of the
   "Austronesian" expansion and concludes that it is best explained as a
   leapfrog rather than a wave-of-advance movement out of New Guinea into
   Remote Oceania. This has important implications for those interested in
   modeling linguistic and biological variation in the region and
   highlights the potential importance of historical accident over process
   in our understanding of culture history.

AB Recent advances in morphometrics and genetics have led to the discovery
   of numerous cryptic species in coral reef ecosystems. A prime example is
   the Montastraea annularis scleractinian coral species complex, in which
   morphological, genetic, and reproductive data concur on species
   boundaries, allowing evaluation of long-term patterns of speciation and
   evolutionary innovation. Here we test for cryptic species in the
   Atlantic species, Montastraea cavernosa, long recognized as polymorphic.
   Our modern samples consist of 94 colonies collected at four locations
   (Belize, Panama, Puerto Rico in the Caribbean; So Tom, in the Eastern
   Atlantic). Our fossil samples consist of 78 colonies from the
   Plio-Pleistocene of Costa Rica and Panama. Landmark morphometric data
   were collected on thin sections of 46 modern and 78 fossil colonies.
   Mahalanobis distances between colonies were calculated using Bookstein
   coordinates, revealing two modern and four fossil morphotypes. The
   remaining 48 of the 94 modern colonies were assigned to morphotype using
   discriminant analysis of calical measurements. Cross-tabulation and
   multiple comparisons tests show no significant morphological differences
   among geographic locations or water depths. Patterns of variation within
   and among fossil morphotypes are similar to modern morphotypes. DNA
   sequence data were collected for two polymorphic nuclear loci (beta-tub1
   and beta-tub2) on all 94 modern colonies. Haplotype networks show that
   both genes consist of two clades, but morphotypes are not associated
   with genetic clades. Genotype frequencies and two-locus genotype
   assignments indicate genetic exchange across clades, and I center dot st
   values show no genetic differentiation between morphotypes at different
   locations. Taken together, our morphological and genetic results do not
   provide evidence for cryptic species in M. cavernosa, but indicate
   instead that this species has an unusually high degree of polymorphism
   over a wide geographic area and persisting for > 25 million years (myr).

AB This article contributes to a special issue examining SDG 14 and other
   international policy instruments for effective implementation of the
   Goal. This article focuses on island ocean states (IOS), or 'small
   island developing states' (SIDS), which are characterized by limited
   land and oceanic remoteness, creating local and international
   dependencies for food, livelihoods, trade and transport. While IOS
   contribute less than 1% to global green-house gases, they are directly
   impacted by extreme weather and climate change, in particular sea level
   rise. Near-shore marine ecosystems (mangroves, seagrasses and coral
   reefs) provide critical coastal protection and other benefits (e.g.
   fisheries), yet continue to be degraded from coastal development. Given
   their importance, restoration is needed where ecosystem function has
   declined, in concert with conservation of healthy sites. The overall
   restoration goals for IOS are to: i) enhance ecological integrity, ii)
   inspire local capacity building, and iii) accelerate climate change
   adaptation. This article examines the scope for such restoration through
   the UN SDGs, the Biodiversity Convention, the UN Framework Convention on
   Climate Change, and the Paris Agreement. Practical considerations of
   near-shore restoration are reviewed, emphasizing local and traditional
   knowledge regarding past and future perspectives. The article concludes
   with policy recommendations to integrate near-shore marine restoration
   across climate adaptation, conservation and planning processes to
   achieve synergies in effectiveness, essential to IOS settings. The UN
   SDGs provide a timely platform for IOS to align international processes
   with local needs to address their own goals in balancing population
   growth, economic development, food security and climate security.

AB With 3o threatened species (14 categorized as Critically Endangered and
   16 as Endangered, sensu IUCN), Coccothrinax (c. 54 species) is the
   flagship palm genus for conservation in the Caribbean Island
   Biodiversity Hotspot. Coccothrinax has its centre of taxonomic diversity
   in these islands, with c. 51 endemic species. We present a conservation
   framework for the 14 Critically Endangered species, found in Cuba, Haiti
   or the Dominican Republic. Only two species (C. jimenezii, C. montana)
   occur in more than one country (Haiti and the Dominican Republic).
   Immediate threats include oil drilling and nickel mining, intrusion of
   saline water into soil, urban and agricultural development, low
   population recruitment, uncontrolled fires, interspecific hybridization,
   and unsustainable ethnobotanical practices. Coccothrinax bermudezii, C.
   borhidiana, C. crinita ssp. crinita, C. leonis and C. spissa are not
   conserved in protected areas. Coccothrinax bermudezii, C. jimenezii, C.
   leonis and C. nipensis are not part of ex situ collections. Based on
   results from a conservation project targeting C. jimenezii, we recommend
   international cooperation between the three range states to implement
   integrative conservation management plans, plant exploration
   initiatives, taxonomic revisions, outreach, and fundraising. The
   ultimate aim of this review is to provide baseline information that will
   develop conservation synergy among relevant parties working on
   Coccothrinax conservation in Cuba, Haiti and the Dominican Republic.
   Such collaborations could also benefit through partnerships with
   botanists working in other countries.

AB The efficient management of water resources and services continues to be
   a concern in many of the small island states of the Caribbean. There are
   growing concerns over the ability of governments in the region to ensure
   the good management and provision of water without jeopardizing economic
   growth and the maintenance of social well-being. This paper provides an
   overview of the major factors influencing the water security facing the
   Caribbean Region and how the emerging concerns are being addressed. The
   key challenges and vulnerabilities may be summarized as lack of data and
   barriers to making available what information there is. Forward planning
   has been largely neglected and is symptomatic of a lack of appreciation
   of the need for having national water policies. In this respect
   Jamaica's development of a national master water plan serves as a good
   example of what is needed. Water service providers have to be efficient,
   well managed and allowed to do their job. This means that they have to
   be on a sound financial footing. The challenge is to find the balance
   between appropriate political and regulatory oversight and the autonomy
   of water managers and service providers.

AB Waigani Lake occupies a small basin adjacent to the Laloki River
   floodplain in lowland Papua New Guinea. The origin of the deposits and
   environmental history of this lake has been interpreted through an
   investigation of plant macrofossils, diatoms, geochemistry and
   mineralogy. Between c. 4400 and 2500 BP peat accumulated, probably under
   a swamp forest. During this period the site was isolated from the Laloki
   River. From 2500 to c. 1200 BP the site was inundated with water from
   the Laloki River with peak flooding after 1700 BP. Herbaceous swamp
   conditions then returned and continued until c. 1965 AD when massive
   nutrient enrichment of the swamp from sewage disposal resulted in a
   return to open water conditions. This sequence is matched, in part, by
   the late Holocene record of four fluvially-influenced lakes in Ecuador.
   Sediments in such lake systems may contain a sensitive record of
   environmental change and of past fluvial activity. This late Holocene
   record from Waigani Lake is the first account from the lowlands of New
   Guinea. It provides a potentially important palaeoenvironmental link
   between northern Australia and upland New Guinea.

AB The Bahamian archipelago consists of approximately 2,400 islands
   occurring in the Atlantic Ocean off the coasts of Florida, Cuba, and
   Hispaniola. In 1982 Donovan Correll and Helen Correll published the most
   current synopsis of the floristic diversity of this island chain. Their
   publication cited a total of 1,371 vascular plant species of which 114
   seed plants were listed as endemic to the archipelago (similar to 8 % of
   the native flora). In the last 30 years, additional herbarium
   collections and taxonomic studies have shown that a number of species
   previously indicated to be endemic to these islands also occur in other
   regions or have been taxonomically merged into other species. The
   current number of species considered endemic to the Bahamian archipelago
   is 89 (similar to 6 % of the total flora). There are 50 endemic species
   that have a known distribution on one (31 species) or two island
   groupings (19 species). Biogeographical analyses of endemic plant
   distributions shows three distinct clusters of species: southern,
   central, and the northern islands, with a fourth cluster that includes
   islands with a small area and one medium size island that seems that has
   been underexplored (i.e., Little Inagua). We anticipate that
   understanding the conservation status of endemic species and their
   distributions will help to develop legislation to preserve this Bahamian
   natural heritage.

   approaches for food security is undertaken, alongside a review of
   methodologies for integrating local and external knowledge. Key gaps and
   actions for EbA for food security in the AIMS region, and potentially
   further afield, are identified. The gaps indicate the lack of coherence
   in AIMS SIDS approaching food security, in terms of policies and actions
   not reflecting the ecosystem-food-climate nexus, the lack of a regional
   framework despite similarities amongst the SIDS, and the infrequency
   with which knowledge integration occurs. To fill these gaps, suggested
   actions highlight knowledge identification and combination, learning
   from others and from history, using local champions, and regularly
   monitoring and evaluating progress. These actions will push forward the
   EbA agenda through improved development and use of knowledge, better
   connections amongst the AIMS SIDS and farther afield, and more

   Leptospira spp. Leptospirosis is maintained in an environment due to
   chronic kidney infection of a wide variety of domestic, peridomestic and
   wild reservoir mammals. In this study the role of pigs in maintenance of
   leptospires on the Caribbean island of St. Kitts was investigated.
   Methodology: The condemned kidneys of 60 pigs slaughtered at a St. Kitts
   abattoir were screened by a quantitative-PCR for the presence of
   Leptospira spp. Positive samples were genotyped using a six-gene based
   multilocus sequence typing scheme.
   Results: Leptospiral DNA was detected in the kidneys of one of the 60
   pigs. Multilocus sequence typing identified the infecting species to be
   L. interrogans.
   Conclusions: Detection of this zoonotic pathogen in the kidneys of a
   seemingly healthy pig raises concerns regarding the subclinical carriers
   of the disease among the island's swine population.

AB Dating of coral reef terraces can provide a record of changes in sea
   level, which should be pronounced during the transition between glacial
   and interglacial periods.  Cores drilled from coral reefs at Barbados in
   the equatorial west Atlantic 1 have revealed the sea-level changes that
   occurred during the Younger Dryas event at the end of the Last Glacial
   Maximum (approximately 11,000 yr BP).  It has not been known, however,
   whether Pacific coral reefs can grow at a rate sufficient to keep up
   with the rise in sea level during such a transition.  Here we report
   results obtained from a 52-m drill core from the post-glacial reef at
   Huon Peninsula, Papua New Guinea, spanning the interval from 7,000 to
   11,000 C-14 yr BP, which shows that coral growth kept pace while the
   relative sea level rose by 50 m.  Although the tectonic environment is
   very different from that at Barbados, the two records compare well when
   corrections are made for local tectonic uplift, showing that sea-level
   rise was similar at both locations.  The rate of rise was greatest
   between 9,000 and 10,000 C-14 yr BP, corresponding to the time of the
   Younger Dryas.

AB Field and laboratory observations of feeding by invasive Pacific red
   lionfish Pterois volitans were conducted during June through August of
   2008, 2009 and 2010 near Lee Stocking Island, Bahamas. Observations of
   this invasive marine predator revealed a previously undocumented
   piscivorous behavior. While slowly approaching prey fish, lionfish
   produce jets of water directed toward their prey. These jets may confuse
   or distract prey, and often result in prey fish facing the attacking
   lionfish, increasing the probability of head-first capture and
   swallowing. While a variety of fishes are reported to create directed
   water jets, to our knowledge, this is the first report of a fish that
   does so during the capture of fish prey. This behavior may confer a high
   degree of predatory efficiency, and thus contribute to the dramatic
   success of this Pacific invader of tropical Western Atlantic and
   Caribbean coral reefs.

AB Small-island coral reef ecosystems are usually closely coupled to the
   activities of human inhabitants. Ahus Island (Papua New Guinea) is an
   isolated Pacific island with a rapidly growing population, heavy
   reliance on marine resources and limited infrastructure. We hypothesized
   that untreated sewage was driving distinct benthic assemblages around
   Ahus and neighbouring uninhabited Onetah. At sites with varying
   proximities to beach toilets, fore-reef herbivorous fish biomass and
   benthic composition were measured alongside reef-flat sedimentary oxygen
   consumption (SOC); a high SOC rate reflects high organic input into
   coastal waters, thus serving as a potential indicator of sewage input.
   Fish biomass was low (17.1-20.1 g m(-2)), but consistent between sites.
   However, cyanobacteria dominated the fore-reef closest to toilets (62
   +/- 3%) with highest reef-flat SOC, whereas hard corals dominated
   furthest away (63 +/- 1%), where SOC was lowest. To our knowledge, this
   is the first study that used SOC to detect local differences in sewage
   pollution. The results indicate that whilst corals can maintain their
   dominance on overfished reefs, additional sewage stress may drive
   pronounced benthic shifts, highlighting the urgency to improve
   small-island waste management.

AB This paper develops and tests the application of a Livelihood
   Vulnerability Index (LVI) for agricultural and natural
   resource-dependent communities in developing countries. The index is
   applied in a comparative study of two wetland communities in Trinidad
   and Tobago, a country that is expected to bear some of the most severe
   impacts of climate change. Our application of the LVI entailed a series
   of critical focus group discussions involving local community
   representatives, government officials and researchers. Researchers
   collected household data for eight types of assets, which were
   aggregated into composite LVIs and differential vulnerabilities of the
   two communities being compared. The results of the analysis suggest that
   one of the communities, "Nariva", was more vulnerable than the other,
   "Caroni", particularly in relation to socio-demographics, health and
   water security, natural disaster and climate variability. Caroni on the
   other hand was more vulnerable in relation to other LVI indicators with
   the exception of food security. On questions of gender, the study found
   that female-headed households were marginally more vulnerable than
   male-headed households. Overall, the study suggests that the livelihood
   vulnerability index can be broadly applied in comparable settings in
   small-island developing states and other developing countries. In so
   doing, it provides a reliable methodology that can be used to assess
   community vulnerability and design management plans in areas with
   limited resources and access to reliable data. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Microplastic contamination of the marine environment has garnered global
   attention in recent years, and its distribution and effects in many
   small island developing states (SIDS) are still undetermined. As such,
   this study serves to detail an investigation of the abundance, spatial
   distribution and characteristics of surface water microplastics in the
   Kingston Harbour, a heavily polluted embayment in Jamaica. Fortnightly
   sampling with a manta trawl (335 jtm mesh) revealed non-variable
   concentrations of 0-5.73 particles/m(3) (0-2,697,674.13 particles/km(2))
   across stations adjacent to mangrove forests, key nursery grounds for
   many commercially important finfish and shellfish. Microplastics found
   in samples were predominantly fragments and were between 1 mm and 2.5
   mm. Fourier Transform Infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy identified
   polyethylene and polypropylene in fragments selected for analysis. These
   data serve to establish a crucial baseline of the status of microplastic
   pollution in Kingston Harbour. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights

AB Big Data is increasingly seen as important in studying the city. This
   pertains to both its methodological capacity and the societal
   implications it may have. In this article we draw on contemporary
   literature to discuss the potentials and challenges of Big Data for
   addressing pressing urban issues. In addition, we examine the potential
   of Big Data as a methodological tool for two Caribbean cities,
   Paramaribo and Port of Spain, for developing new knowledge on urban
   issues that matter in such cities, specifically water-related risks and
   security. We do so by interrogating Twitter data to uncover relevant
   geographical and social patterns of tweets pertaining to water-related
   risks (Paramaribo) and security/crime issues (Port of Spain) and
   confronting these with qualitative knowledge about these places. We
   argue that Big Data are a powerful resource for discovering interesting
   patterns, but one needs to be critical of the methodological caveats and
   consider the social-cultural specificities of ICT use.

AB We developed a method for quantifying the abundance of the threatened
   staghorn coral (Acropora cervicornis) and evaluated the accuracy of
   commonly used methods to assess colony condition. For small- to
   medium-sized colonies, we show that colony ellipsoid volume estimated
   from simple colony dimensions serves as a reliable and efficient proxy
   for the more time-consuming, conventional measure of colony total linear
   extension, and that this predictive relationship varies significantly
   among extant populations in the Caribbean. We also determined that
   visual estimates of colony partial mortality closely approximate to true
   values for colonies with <25% mortality, with in situ estimates
   outperforming estimates from digital images. These results provide coral
   reef managers and restoration practitioners with guidance for assessing
   partial mortality and location-specific regression models to estimate
   amount of staghorn coral in both extant and restored staghorn
   populations in Belize, the United States Virgin Islands, and the Dry
   Tortugas National Park, Florida, U.S.A. As staghorn coral monitoring and
   restoration efforts continue to expand in the Caribbean, these methods
   for quickly determining staghorn abundance and condition will directly
   aid resource managers tasked with monitoring wild populations and
   tracking restoration success over time.

AB Monthly Amazon River discharge is correlated to historical monthly sea
   surface salinity (SSS) in the western tropical Atlantic Ocean and the
   Caribbean Sea. At Barbados a very high inverse correlation (R-2 = 0.92)
   exists if the discharge is lagged by two months, which corresponds to
   the travel time from the Amazon mouth to Barbados. Due to its proximity
   to Barbados, a small amount of the correlation can also be attributed to
   the Orinoco River. Between Barbados and the central Caribbean Sea (75W)
   the peak correlation of Amazon River discharge and SSS occurs at
   progressively longer lag times, representing the longer travel time. The
   correlation is highest at Barbados and diminishes with distance
   downstream. Downstream of the central Caribbean Sea (75W) no correlation
   is evident, as the Amazon water becomes too diluted to be clearly
   defined by available data. The results of the analysis are used to
   calculate surface current speeds of 0.34 +/- 0.09 m/s from the Amazon
   mouth to Barbados and 0.10 +/- 0.02 m/s from Barbados to the central
   Caribbean Sea (75W). Downstream of Barbados a subsurface maximum in
   correlation develops. The correlation is eroded more strongly at
   shallower depths due to more intense surface processes (e.g.,
   evaporation and precipitation).

AB Herein we present the first evidence for the presence of Paralytic
   Shellfish Poison (PSP) in Trinidadian waters. The toxin was found in a
   meat extract of the mussel, Perna viridis. PSP has not previously been
   demonstrated in the shellfish of Caribbean islands. The presence of PSP
   in Trinidad is therefore significant in that it presents an opportunity
   to better understand the dynamics of PSP and algal blooms in both a
   region and island environment not normally associated with PSP.
   P. viridis is not native to Trinidad, but rather originates from eastern
   Asia. It presented itself only recently in Trinidadian waters.
   Interestingly, shellfish consumption and algal blooms have had a long
   history of coexistence in Trinidad without any record of human
   intoxications. In this context, potential Public Health implications of
   finding PSP in a non-native shellfish species are briefly discussed. (C)

AB The tropics are characterized by a variety of atmospheric and oceanic
   systems dominated by multiscale interaction processes. This is Part I of
   a two-part review study on climate and climate variability of the
   Eastern Tropical Pacific (ETP). Here, the mean fields of incoming short
   wave radiation, surface energy fluxes, sea surface temperature, sea
   level pressure, salinity, wind patterns at 10m height, wind stress curl,
   precipitation, and evaporation are analyzed and synthetized using
   available data including that from the last decade. Given the strong
   interaction between the ETP and Caribbean Sea-Atlantic Ocean, mean field
   discussions are presented for two different domains, a relatively large
   domain from 24 degrees S - 36 degrees N and between 129 degrees W -17
   degrees W, and a smaller domain embedding only the Caribbean Sea and the
   easternmost part of the ETP. Most results on the climate of these two
   regions can be used as the base line for climate change studies.
   Interannual variability of tropical cyclones is also investigated over
   the domain of the latter two basins in the smaller domain. The study is
   complemented with a short review of some low frequency modes, such as,
   El Nino-Southern Oscillation, the Pacific Decadal Oscillation, and the
   Atlantic Multi-decadal Oscillation. Such low-frequency modes are known
   to modulate regional systems, including tropical cyclone frequency. Rev.

   illustrate how the priorities of an international environmental
   nongovernmental organization (NGO) aligned with donor expectations and
   diverged from the expressed conservation preferences of local residents
   for management and enforcement. Analysis of data from semistructured
   interviews with local residents in three villages identified three local
   community expectations of a Madang NGO: serving as an alternative to the
   state; providing material resources; and sustaining long-term
   relationships. Using a political ecology lens, this study illustrates a
   mismatch between what the NGO does and the expectations and preferences
   of local residents. Examining this divergence is critical in
   understanding how NGOs prioritize certain activities over others and
   what such choices mean for biodiversity conservation. This article
   provides evidence that some international NGOs prioritize donor goals
   above local community expectations, implementing conservation activities
   that meet biodiversity objectives but not local communities' needs.

AB Since the 1960s, several countries and international agencies have
   embarked on collection and preservation of the germplasm of food crops.
   Such has been the case in Papua New Guinea (PNG). However, as outlined
   in this study, in PNG there has been considerable economic waste in
   germplasm maintenance. Over half the original PNG collections of tare,
   yams, sweet potato, cassava, aikiba, sage and bananas have been lost.
   This study outlines how funding vagaries, combined with pest,
   environment and staff problems have led to these losses. The study
   concludes with a suite of options to improve the efficiency and
   effectiveness of maintaining PNG's ex situ field collections of
   germplasm. Avoiding losses of germplasm is potentially important for
   indigenous agriculture in PNG and South Pacific. (C) 2001 Elsevier

AB Ciguatera fish poisoning is a seafood-borne illness caused by the
   consumption of fish that have accumulated lipid-soluble ciguatoxins,
   produced by dinoflagellates of the genera Gambierdiscus, Ostreopsis,
   Coolia and Prorocentrum. The true extent of the disease and its impact
   on tourism and public health on the Caribbean islands is poorly
   understood. For this reason, we analyze the incidence of ciguatera in
   the Caribbean states (CS) and San Andrés Island (SAI), seeking spatial
   and temporal trends. Through epidemiological reports obtained from the
   Caribbean Epidemiology Centre (CAREC) and the Departmental Health
   Secretariat of SAI, the per capita incidence of ciguatera has been
   calculated for the periods 1980 to 2010 and 2007 to 2011, respectively.
   Subsequently the data were analyzed using t tests, incidence rate ratio
   and rank correlation. The data show that, over the period 1980-2010,
   there were 10 710 cases reported from 18 CAREC countries, with an
   average annual incidence of 42/100 000. There was an increase between
   the periods 1980-1990 and 2000-2010 with annual averages calculated from
   reported cases of 34.2 and 45.2 / 100 000 respectively. The island of
   Montserrat presented the highest incidence in the region, 350 / 100 000
   while SAI showed an incidence of 25/100 000 inhabitants, occupying the
   eighth position among the analyzed islands. The rate ratio (average
   annual incidence 2000-2010 / average annual incidence 1980-1990) was
   1.36, so there was a 32% increase in the average annual incidence among
   CAREC countries and almost 300% between the two time periods. The
   ciguatera incidence level in the Caribbean has increased over the last
   31 years, mainly in the Eastern Caribbean. The Bahamas, Antigua and
   Barbuda contribute greatly to the reported increase. Considering that
   the development model of much of the region is based on the tourism
   industry and that fish is a major protein source for Caribbean
   communities, it can be concluded that ciguatera is a growing problem
   which is expected to increase in parallel with environmental change.
X4 La ciguatera es una enfermedad causada por el consumo de peces que han
   acumulado ciguatoxinas liposolubles, producidas por dinoflagelados de
   los géneros Gambierdiscus, Ostreopsis, Coolia y Prorocentrum. El
   verdadero alcance de la enfermedad y su impacto en el turismo y la salud
   pública es poco conocida. Por tal motivo, se analizó la incidencia de
   ciguatera en los estados insulares del Caribe (EIC) y en la isla de San
   Andrés (SAI), en busca de tendencias espaciales y temporales. A través
   de los informes epidemiológicos obtenidos del Centro Epidemiológico del
   Caribe (CAREC) y de la Secretaría de Salud Departamental de SAI, se
   calculó la incidencia per cápita de ciguatera en el período comprendido
   entre 1980 - 2010 para los EIC y 2007 - 2011 para SAI. Los datos fueron
   analizados mediante pruebas t, tasas de incidencia y análisis de
   ranking. Los resultados muestran que en el período 1980-2010 hubo 10710
   casos registrados de 18 países del CAREC, con una incidencia anual
   promedio del 42/100 000. Asimismo, hubo un aumento entre los períodos
   1980-1990 y 2000- 2010, con un promedio anual calculado a partir de los
   casos registrados de 34.2 y 45.2 / 100 000, respectivamente. La isla de
   Montserrat presentó la mayor incidencia en la región, 350/100 000
   mientras que SAI presentó una incidencia de 25/100 000 habitantes,
   ocupando el octavo lugar en comparación con las islas analizadas. La
   proporción de las tasas para los países CAREC (incidencia anual promedio

   lo que hubo un aumento del 32% en la incidencia anual promedio entre los
   países y casi el 300% entre los dos períodos de tiempo. El nivel de
   incidencia registrada de ciguatera en el Caribe ha aumentado en los
   últimos 31 años, principalmente el Caribe Oriental. Islas como Bahamas,
   Antigua y Barbuda contribuyen en gran medida al aumento registrado.
   Teniendo en cuenta que el modelo de desarrollo de gran parte de la
   región se basa en la industria del turismo y el pescado es una fuente de
   proteínas importante para las comunidades del Caribe, se puede concluir
   que la ciguatera es un problema creciente que se espera que aumente de
   forma paralela a los cambios ambientales.

AB Recent changes in ocean temperature have impacted marine ecosystem
   function globally. Nevertheless, the responses have depended upon the
   rate of change of temperature and the season when the changes occur,
   which are spatially variable. A rigorous statistical analysis of sea
   surface temperature observations over 25 years was used to examine
   spatial variability in overall and seasonal temperature trends within
   the wider Caribbean. The basin has experienced high spatial variability
   in rates of change of temperature. Most of the warming has been due to
   increases in summer rather than winter temperatures. However, warming
   was faster in winter in the Loop Current area and the south-eastern
   Caribbean, where the annual temperature ranges have contracted. Waters
   off Florida, Cuba and the Bahamas had a tendency towards cooling in
   winter, increasing the amplitude of annual temperature ranges. These
   detailed patterns can be used to elucidate ecological responses to
   climatic change in the region. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

AB TC here is much interest in using renewable energy sources such as wind,

   Trinidad & Tobago Electricity Commission (TTEC) and Powergen (Power
   Generation Company of Trinidad & Tobago), have expressed an interest in
   wind power generation and integration to supplement its conventional
   fossil fuel, i.e., natural gas, approach. The Caribbean island, Of
   Tobago was chosen for investigation of ifs wind power potential mainly
   due to its better alignment to the prevailing winds, i.e,, the North
   East Trades, than Trinidad.
   This article focusses on an optimal selection method of matching a Wind
   Energy Conversion System (WECS) to wind patterns, such as Tobago. If
   incorporates various techniques and economical decisions which are to be
   considered and used when sizing available commercial WECSs to potential
   wind patterns.

AB The phenotypic, distributional, and genetic distinctiveness of the
   bandtail goatfish Upeneus taeniopterus within the genus Upeneus
   (Mullidae) is elaborated using a comprehensive alphataxonomic and
   barcoding approach. Based on a large number of morphometric, meristic
   and colour characters obtained from 71 preserved or freshly photographed
   specimens, an updated diagnosis, a redescription, and detailed inter-and
   intraspecific comparisons are provided. The distribution information is
   revised with strong emphasis on ensuring correct species identification.
   Upeneus taeniopterus shows intraspecific variation in morphology and
   number of oblique bars on the caudal fin related to two size classes,
   'subadults' (< 12 cm SL) and 'adults' (12 cm SL or larger). Indications
   for population differences were only detected for the smaller size
   class, possibly reflecting geographic developmental differences. This
   species is widely distributed in the Indo-Pacific from Mozambique to the
   Tuamoto Archipelago and from the Ryukyu Islands to Tonga and occurs
   mostly in very shallow subtidal sandy beach or lagoon habitats of
   oceanic islands and atolls. Four new records of the species for Palau,
   Papua (Indonesia), Tonga and Vanuatu are reported. Comparisons with all
   other 36 congeners revealed clear differences from U. taeniopterus in
   the combination of maximum size, eight meristic and colour characters,
   distributional range and habitat selection. The only congeneric species
   with similarly large maximum size and wide distributional range is
   Upeneus vittatus, which differs however in morphology, colour and
   habitat. The congeneric species differ from U. taeniopterus with
   sequence divergences which are comparable to those observed among
   genera. More genetic tissue samples are needed to further investigate
   the relatedness among Upeneus species and to search for phylogeographic
   patterns in U. taeniopterus. The need to thoroughly study the
   insufficiently explored subtidal sandy habitats of oceanic islands and
   atolls is emphasized.

AB The seasonal and interannual variability of moisture transports over the
   Intra-Americas Sea (including the Gulf of Mexico and the Caribbean Sea)
   is evaluated using the NCEP-NCAR global reanalysis. The seasonal
   variability of these moisture transports is consistent with previous
   studies and shows distinctive winter and summer regimes. Boreal winter
   moisture is mainly delivered to the central United States from the
   Pacific with some contribution from the Gulf of Mexico. It is during the
   boreal summer that the moisture flow over the Intra-Americas Sea is most
   effective in supplying the water vapor to the central United States via
   the northern branch of the Caribbean low-level jet. The increase of
   intensity of this jet during July is associated with an increase in
   evaporation over the Intra-Americas Sea, consistent with midsummer
   drought conditions over this region.
   During both summer and winter, the interannual variability of the inflow
   of moisture from the Intra-Americas Sea into central United States is
   associated with Caribbean low-level jet variability. The source of the
   varying moisture is mainly the Gulf of Mexico and the North Atlantic
   area just east of the Bahamas Islands and the sink is precipitation over
   east-central United States. The main teleconnection pattern for these
   interannual variations appears to be the Pacific-North American,
   although in boreal winter ENSO and possibly the North Atlantic
   Oscillation may also play a role. During boreal summer, associations
   with ENSO mainly involve the zonal moisture exchange between the
   Intra-Americas Sea/tropical Atlantic and the tropical Pacific.

AB DNA barcoding is helping in discovering high levels of cryptic species
   and an underestimation of biodiversity in many groups of organisms.
   Although mammals are arguably the most studied and one of the least
   speciose taxonomic classes, the rate of species discovery is increasing
   and biased for small mammals on islands. An earlier study found bats in
   the Caribbean as a taxonomic and geographic deficiency in the
   International Barcode of Life initiative to establish a genetic
   reference database to enable specimen identification to species. Recent
   surveys in Dominican Republic, Jamaica, and Martinique have documented
   and barcoded half of the 58 bat species known from the Caribbean. I
   analyze all available barcode data of Caribbean bats to investigate
   biogeography and cryptic species in the Neotropical region. Analysis of
   the mitochondrial DNA gene cytochrome c oxidase subunit 1 results in a
   phylogenetic tree with all but one species as well-supported and
   reciprocally monophyletic. With a broader sampling across the
   Neotropics, there are also divergent lineages that exhibit biogeographic
   structuring: (i) a phylogenetic split between northern and southern
   Dominican Republic in three species, (ii) two taxa with cryptic species
   associated with higher degree of island endemism, (iii) populations of
   two widely distributed species with deep divergence between the
   Caribbean and North and Central America, and (iv) one species in the
   Caribbean with affinities to taxa in South America.

AB Populations of Oreaster reticulatus in the Bahamas, US Virgin Islands,
   and Grenadines are compared to examine regional and between habitat
   variation in population size, density, dispersion, and demography. This
   sea star, a microphagous substratum grazer, generally is randomly
   distributed at densities of 1-5 100 m(-2) (2-5 kg fresh weight) in
   populations numbering 100s to 1000s. Populations in grassbeds have a
   greater proportion of juveniles than those on sand bottoms, suggesting
   grassbeds are nursery areas and emigration to adjacent sand bottoms
   occurs among adults. Size (radius) frequency distributions are
   approximately normal on sand bottoms but mean size decreases with
   density, suggesting intraspecific competition for food limits growth.
   Comparisons over a 20 year interval (1974-94) of Oreaster at three sites
   in the Grenadines indicate little change in population structure and
   abundance. The sparse distribution of Oreaster in small populations with
   low rates of recruitment and turnover render this sea star vulnerable to
   human exploitation and alteration of habitat.

AB The effects of climate change and marine invasive species have posed a
   major threat to significant ecological, aesthetic, economic and amenity
   value to the countries and territories of the Wider Caribbean Region.
   Today, the Caribbean Sea is plagued with the invasive lionfish ( Pterois
   volitans and P. miles). As the range and abundance of the lionfish
   throughout the Caribbean has grown, recognition of the grave threat it
   poses to the native marine ecosystems has prompted the development of
   lionfish management plans across the region. The efforts of eight
   countries in the region to manage lionfish are evaluated using the US
   Environmental Protection Agency Aquatic Invasive Species framework and
   the inclusion of climate change and/or changing conditions. The
   countries and overseas territories evaluated were Anguilla, Bahamas,
   Cayman Islands, Grenada, St. Eustatius, St. Lucia, St. Vincent and the
   US Virgin Islands. Although specific strategies differed amongst the
   islands depending upon needs, culture, and individual circumstances,
   most of the plans included aspects of education and outreach, control
   and monitoring protocols, and research and information management. Areas
   that were found to be notably weak to nonexistent included leadership,
   prevention, early detection and rapid response and restoration; This
   comparative analysis provides opportunities for knowledge sharing and
   intra- and inter-country cooperation, facilitating the transfer and
   development of interventions that contribute to the conservation of
   significant island biodiversity. (C) 2017 The Authors. Published by

AB Little is known of the attitudes of Caribbean people toward freeroaming
   and pet cats, so we conducted a questionnaire survey of primaryschool
   children aged 5 to 13 years (n = 417, 206 girls and 209 boys, while two
   questionnaires did not indicate gender) in 23 schools around St. Kitts.
   Over 50% reported they owned or had owned a cat, and ownership was
   associated with feelings of happiness and comfort. Children reported 511
   reasons for liking cats compared with 433 reasons for disliking them.
   They liked cats mainly for behavioral reasons (58%), such as cats being
   playful and providing companionship, and aesthetic reasons (47%), such
   as cats being colorful and beautiful. Children only infrequently
   reported liking cats for practical reasons (14%), such as removing
   vermin. Eighty-four percent of cat owners reported purchasing special
   food for their cats, and 96% provided water. Over 60% of non-cat owners
   provided water for free-roaming cats. Most school children (43%) thought
   there were too many cats on St. Kitts, while only 28% thought this was
   not the case. The children principally owned cats because they loved
   animals (43%) and cats controlled vermin (28%). Seventy-two percent of
   children thought there were too many rodents on St. Kitts. Most children
   (61%) were aware that cats were associated with human diseases but were
   principally afraid of cats because of the possibility of being bitten or
   scratched (54%). In summary, our study shows that primary-school
   children on St. Kitts mostly have positive attitudes toward free-roaming
   cats and are concerned for cats' wellbeing. Although important in their
   own right, children's attitudes often reflect those of their families
   and so our findings could facilitate decisionmaking on cat welfare
   issues in the region.

   by lack of a taxonomic framework that employs molecular data as a
   complement to shell characters, larval forms and internal anatomy. The
   fauna includes more than 32 known species (30+ Hyriidae, 2 Unionidae),
   but has not been revised for 55 years, despite minor amendments. The
   hyriids are relics of Gondwana, represented in Australia and New Guinea
   by the ancestral Velesunioninae and in Australia and New Zealand by the
   Hyriinae (Tribe Hyridellini). Many taxonomic and phylogeographic issues
   await resolution, including the relationships between Australasian and
   South American species, and between Australian and New Zealand species,
   and the status of species in New Guinea (including uncertain reports of
   Unionidae) and the Solomon Islands. Once these are clarified, it will be
   easier to identify threatened species and evaluate the conservation
   status of the fauna. At present, only seven taxa are named in the IUCN
   Red List or under national/state legislation, and these are not
   representative. Threatening processes include altered flow regimes,
   catchment disturbances, salinisation, pollution and invasive species.
   While the need for a taxonomic revision is paramount, progress in
   conservation may depend also upon involving the wider community.

   uses of the latex, leaves, and wood was reported. Estimated mean revenue
   for 2008 was USD 1,153.10 and USD 637.30 per farmer for breadfruit and
   chataigne, respectively. The results suggest that with increasing
   domestic demand these crops have become cash crops. Promotion of food
   and non-food uses will further increase farm incomes and the
   contribution of breadfruit and chataigne to food and nutrition security
   in Trinidad and Tobago.

AB Crassispira cerithina (Anton, 1838) is a common shallow water conoidean
   gastropod species, broadly distributed throughout the Indo-West Pacific.
   It has a distinctive shell morphology and has been referred to in many
   publications. It is also the first species of its family to have been
   studied from the viewpoint of toxinology. However, our molecular
   phylogenetic analysis based on fragments of the COI and 28 S rRNA genes
   reveals the existence of two closely related distinct species, one of
   which is described as new (C. scala n. sp.). These two species are
   sympatric in several regions of the Indo-Pacific-in the Philippines,
   Papua New Guinea, Vanuatu and New Caledonia. They can be reliably
   distinguished by shell morphology and thus cannot be considered truly
   cryptic species. The radula is very similar in both species and does not
   permit species delimitation. A conchological reappraisal of further
   material similar to C. cerithina allows us to recognize two additional
   species, which are described as new (C. procera n. sp. from the Coral
   Sea and Philippines, and C. aurea n. sp. from Tahiti). These results
   demonstrate that even 'well-known' and seemingly well defined species
   may be species complexes and that molecular techniques should be
   routinely applied to confirm specimen identification, especially as part
   of resource-consuming studies, such as toxinology.

AB Aim: The aim of this study was to test historical and contemporary
   influences onpopulation structure in the giant clams, Tridacna maxima
   (Roding, 1798) and T. crocea (Lamarck, 1819). To refine the location of
   clade boundaries within a newly resurrected species, Tridacna noae
   (Roding, 1798).
   Location: Indo-Australian archipelago, including Indonesia, the
   Philippines, Australia, Papua New Guinea, the Solomon Islands, Republic
   of Kiribati, the Line Islands and Taiwan.
   Methods: We used isolation-migration (IMa) coalescent models and
   distance-based redundancy analyses (dbRDA) to test the relative
   influence of barriers and continuous distances on historical divergence,
   gene flow and population structure of T. maxima and T. crocea.
   Continuous metrics of distance included present-day and Last Glacial
   Maximum overwater distances along with probability of larval dispersal
   (LD) among sampling sites. We combined new mitochondrial cytochrome
   oxidase subunit I (mtDNA COI) sequences with existing data to compile
   the largest data set of these species yet analysed.
   Results: The Pleistocene land barriers of the Sunda Shelf and Torres
   Strait were associated with old (>0.5Myr) divergence times. The western
   and eastern boundaries of the Halmahera Eddy were also locations of
   significant, but more recent, divergence. No gene flow was detected
   across any of the four barriers tested. Larval dispersal distances
   between sampling sites were significant predictors of T. crocea
   population structure, accounting for differentiation above and beyond
   the contribution of barriers. We further delineated the species range of
   T. noae and showed that its two known clades are sympatric in central
   Indonesia.
   Main conclusions: The strong signature of historical barriers on genetic
   differentiation argues against the assumption that Indo-Pacific Tridacna
   are open meta-populations. Despite similar life histories, T. maxima and
   T. crocea differ in their mtDNA population structure. The widespread
   species (T. maxima) exhibits population structure linked solely with
   historical factors, whereas T. crocea's population structure reflects
   both historical factors and LD distances.

AB Dietary patterns which promote adequate intakes of Ca are essential for
   maximal growth and the development of peak bone mass. In this study,
   dietary intakes of children, adolescents and adults living in three
   African countries, Papua New Guinea (PNG), Indonesia, Guatemala, New
   Zealand (NZ) and Canada were compared in relation to differences in food
   consumption patterns. Food intakes were measured using either a 24 hour
   recall or weighed record; and Ca intakes were calculated using food
   composition data based on analysed or literature values. Results showed
   that cereals and/or roots provided over 60% of daily energy intakes in
   the African, Asian and Pacific countries, and dairy products were not
   consumed. In contrast, cereals contribute less than 33% of energy
   intakes, and dairy products over 12% in Canada and NZ. Calcium intakes
   in rural Ghana, Malawi, PNG and Indonesia were approximately 50% lower
   than in NZ, Canada, Guatemala and Uganda tie, 295-413 mg/d vs 607-819
   mg/d). The calcium intakes of over 75% of adults and children living in
   countries with low calcium intakes were below recommended intakes
   compared with 30 - 40% in the other countries. These findings
   demonstrate the need for careful selection of calcium rich food items
   globally. The achievement of this goal may be difficult in some Asian,
   African and Pacific diets without the inclusion of dairy products, tofu,
   sesame and/or small fish with bones.

AB Biodiversity hotspots are used widely to designate priority regions for
   conservation efforts. It is unknown, however, whether the current
   network of hotspots adequately represents globally threatened taxonomic
   diversity for whole plant and animal groups. We used a mammalian group
   traditionally neglected in terms of conservation efforts, the rodents,
   in order to test whether biodiversity hotspots match the current
   distribution of threatened taxa (genera and species). Significantly
   higher numbers of threatened rodent genera and species fell within
   biodiversity hotspots; nonetheless over 25% of the total threatened
   genera and species did not occur in any biodiversity hotspot. This was
   particularly true for the Australian region, where 100% of the
   threatened genera and species fell outside biodiversity hotspots, with
   many threatened taxa found in Papua-New Guinea. We suggest to officially
   including Papua New Guinea among biodiversity hotspots for rodents, and
   also the steppic/semidesert areas of central Asia.

AB The Solomon Sea is a key region in the Pacific Ocean where equatorial
   and subtropical circulations are connected. The region exhibits the
   highest levels in sea level variability in the entire south tropical
   Pacific Ocean. Altimeter data was utilized to explore sea level and
   western boundary currents in this poorly understood portion of the
   ocean. Since the geography of the region is extremely intricate, with
   numerous islands and complex bathymetry, specifically reprocessed
   along-track data in addition to standard gridded data were utilized in
   this study. Sea level anomalies (SLA) in the Solomon Sea principally
   evolve at seasonal and interannual time scales. The annual cycle is
   phased by Rossby waves arriving in the Solomon Strait, whereas the
   interannual signature corresponds to the basin-scale ENSO mode. The
   highest SLA variability are concentrated in the eastern Solomon Sea,
   particularly at the mouth of the Solomon Strait, where they are
   associated with a high eddy kinetic energy signal that was particularly
   active during the phase transition during the 1997-1998 ENSO event.
   Track data appear especially helpful for documenting the fine structure
   of surface coastal currents. The annual variability of the boundary
   currents that emerged from altimetry compared quite well with the
   variability seen at the thermocline level, as based on numerical
   simulations. At interannual time scales, western boundary current
   transport anomalies counterbalance changes in western equatorial Pacific
   warm water volume, confirming the phasing of South Pacific western
   boundary currents to ENSO. Altimetry appears to be a valuable source of
   information for variability in low latitude western boundary currents
   and their associated transport in the South Pacific.

AB Caribbean damselfish species (genus Stegastes) are permanently
   territorial, display obvious aggressive behavior related to territory
   defense, and have divergent habitat preferences for primary territory
   substrates. Territory quality is directly tied to variation in
   reproductive success among individuals, which suggests that ecological
   isolation plays a key role in the maintenance of species boundaries in
   this genus. If so, hybridization is expected to occur among
   closely-related damselfish species when there is a limitation in the
   availability of preferred primary habitat. To test this prediction, we
   collected damselfish from both high disturbance (Jamaica) and low
   disturbance (Barbados) coral reef environments, and looked for evidence
   of hybridization among species based on both morphological variation and
   discordance between mitochondrial and nuclear genetic markers.
   Consistent with the hypothesis that species boundaries in this system
   are maintained by strong substrate preferences and aggressive
   territoriality, we found evidence for extensive hybridization in
   Jamaica, where intense hurricanes have led to considerable habitat
   degradation over the last 30 years. In light of ongoing climate change,
   this result suggests that hybridization leading to a blurring of
   ecological species boundaries may represent an increasingly common yet
   underappreciated threat to many coral reef fish species. (c) 2012

AB Exposure to ambient air pollution has been linked to adverse health
   outcomes ranging fromasthma to premature mortality. However, little to
   no information exists on the exposure of residents and visitors in the
   Caribbean islands. While a few previous studies have quantified levels
   of PM10 (particulate matter <10 mu m) from Sahara dust in Trinidad, our
   study focussed on a local source of air pollution, traffic emissions.
   Mass concentrations of black carbon (BC) and PM2.5 (PM <2.5 mu m) were
   measured at ten locations across the islands of Trinidad and Tobago over
   a three-week period. PM2.5 concentrations were observed to be heavily
   influenced by air masses showing origins from the Sahara Desert (31%),
   North America (26%) and Atlantic Ocean (42%), which resulted in similar
   average concentrations between the two islands. Average concentrations
   of BC were five times higher in Trinidad than Tobago (2.0 vs 0.43 mu
   g/m(3)). In addition, BC in Trinidad was three times higher near than
   away from major roads (2.21 vs. 0.72 mu g/m(3)), with concentrations
   reaching levels comparable to those near highways in largeMetropolitan
   cities. The elevated BC concentrations observed in this study suggests
   that significant exposure to diesel exhaust is occurring in Trinidad,
   with significant contributions from traffic. (c) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All

AB Chemical analysis showed that some foods cooked in a cast iron pot
   gained significantly in iron content. This was particularly so for rice
   and green vegetables, but not for the major root staples of Papua New
   Guinea. It therefore seems unlikely that a campaign to encourage the use
   of iron pots for cooking would significantly increase the iron content
   of diets in Papua New Guinea to an extent which would mitigate the high
   prevalence of iron deficiency.

AB The Polyphysaceae is a well-studied family of green algae occurring in
   tropical and warm-temperate regions around the world. One of its
   species, Parvocaulis exiguus (Solms-Laubach) S. Berger et al.
   (Phycologia 42: 506-561, 2003), has previously been reported from both
   the Indian and the Pacific Oceans. This report presents the first record
   of Parvocaulis exiguus from the Atlantic Ocean. It was collected at 18 m
   depth from rocky substrata surrounded by seagrass off the Dutch Windward
   Caribbean island St. Eustatius. Owing to its small size and close
   resemblance to co-occurring species, it is possible that this species
   has been previously overlooked in the Atlantic. Although Polyphysaceae
   have been intensively studied in the Caribbean and other Atlantic
   regions, this is not the case for subtidal algal vegetation on St.
   Eustatius. Parvocaulis exiguus could have been present for a longer time
   around St. Eustatius or it could have been introduced with shipping.
   Future investigations may show if Parvocaulis exiguus will be observed
   in additional locations in the Caribbean.

AB The impact is studied of small land areas on the configuration and
   structure of the tropical cyclone as well as on the variations of
   different characteristics of hurricanes (wind field, kinetic energy, and
   vorticity) during their passage over islands. The results of
   computations based on the regional numerical atmospheric ETA model for
   the hurricanes of the Caribbean Sea and typhoons of the Northwestern
   Pacific revealed that the disturbance of the symmetric circulation in
   the vortex accompanied by significant kinetic energy losses takes place
   when crossing the archipelagos or separate islands. It is demonstrated
   that the vortex intensity depends not on the energy loss due to the
   underlying surface roughness only but on the heat flux from it as well.
   The kinetic energy generation in the hurricane sharply decreases as a
   result of the decrease in the pressure gradient over the land that is
   caused, in turn, by the tropical cyclone moving away from the oceanic
   heat source. At the recurring appearance of the cyclone over the warm
   ocean waters, its deepening and intensification recommence.

AB Intensification and western displacement of the North Atlantic
   Subtropical High (NASH) is projected for this century, which can
   decrease Caribbean and southeastern American rainfall on seasonal and
   annual timescales. However, additional hydroclimate records are needed
   from the northern Caribbean to understand the long-term behavior of the
   NASH, and better forecast its future behavior. Here we present a
   multi-proxy sinkhole lake reconstruction from a carbonate island that is
   proximal to the NASH (Abaco Island, The Bahamas). The reconstruction
   indicates the northern Bahamas experienced a drought from similar to
   3300 to similar to 2500 Cal yrs BP, which coincides with evidence from
   other hydroclimate and oceanographic records (e.g., Africa, Caribbean,
   and South America) for a synchronous southern displacement of the
   Intertropical Convergence Zone and North Atlantic Hadley Cell. The
   specific cause of the hydroclimate change in the northeastern Caribbean
   region from similar to 3300 to 2500 Cal yrs BP was probably coeval
   southern or western displacement of the NASH, which would have increased
   northeastern Caribbean exposure to subsiding air from higher altitudes.

AB Trinidad and Tobago is an oil exporting small island developing state
   (SIDS) with a 0.12% contribution to global emissions and with important
   socio-economic challenges. It has producer, electricity and transport
   fuel subsidies. It is at an interesting juncture in subsidy reform: the
   government faces the embeddedness of distributive justice norms that are
   contested by fiscal prudence and environmental stewardship norms. The
   value of the paper is twofold. First it develops a subsidy
   intractability framework to explain reform global narratives that
   highlights: the power of agents, the nature of contested economic,
   justice and environmental norms and the availability of mechanisms for
   reform. Second, this framework is used to explain reform narratives and
   trajectories in Trinidad and Tobago using data from public documents and
   from a unique elite survey of former and present heads of state,
   politicians, policy makers and stakeholders. Even in conditions of
   falling oil prices and national revenue and pressures to reduce
   emissions, where redistributive justice arguments are heavily embedded
   in public discourses, those aspects of the subsidy that have
   developmental or distributive justice goals are more intractable. The
   results of the study have implications for carbon emission reduction
   strategies in developing states with fossil fuel reserves.

AB There is widespread concern about the presence of antimicrobial drugs in
   milk. The presence of drug residues in milk may have public health
   implications. Milk samples (n = 25 to 65/country) were collected from
   bulk tanks and commercial vendors in Barbados, Costa Rica, and Jamaica
   between February 1996 and August 1997. Bulk tank samples were collected
   from high milk-producing regions of Jamaica and Costa Rica and from 26
   dairy farms in Barbados. Milk pH, bacterial growth (total CFU/ml and the
   presence of Streptococcus agalactiae and Staphylococcus aureus), and the
   presence of antimicrobials were determined. Milk samples were tested by
   a microbial inhibition test (Delvotest-P, Gist-Brocades Food
   Ingredients, Inc.) to screen for antimicrobial drugs, All positives were
   retested for the presence of beta-lactam antibiotics after incubating
   with penicillinase and some positives were identified by high-pressure
   liquid chromatography-UV, Mean pH values ranged from 6.5 to 6.7. S.
   aureus was identified in bulk tank samples from Costa Rica (52%),
   Barbados (44%), and Jamaica (46%). S. agalactiae was identified in bulk
   tank samples from Costa Rica (28%), Barbados (8 and 16%), and Jamaica
   (18%). Antimicrobial residues were detected in some bulk tank samples
   from Barbados (8%) and Jamaica (10%) but not in samples from Costa Rica
   All positives in milk from Jamaica and Barbados were determined to be
   beta-lactams. No residues were detected in pasteurized milk samples from
   Barbados or ultrahigh-temperature milk from Jamaica. The presence of
   beta-lactam residues in some of these samples suggests the
   appropriateness of testing milk prior to processing for consumption.

AB The geological framework of eastern Papua New Guinea allows us to obtain
   direct insight into how the Alpine region might have looked like during
   its earliest stages of tectonic growth, and to shed light on the spatial
   and temporal relationships between subduction and formation of relief
   before tightening of the AlpsApennines junction. In both Alpine and
   Papuan cases, exhumation of high-pressure rocks was not associated with
   any significant erosion, but took place while adjacent sedimentary
   basins were virtually starved of orogenic sediments and largely
   characterized by slow accumulation of deep-water mudrocks and
   limestones. The subduction and exhumation stages were thus well distinct
   and separated in time from the genesis of topographic relief, which did
   not take place until many millions years later.

AB The neogastropod family Costellariidae is a large and successful group
   of carnivorous marine mollusks that encompasses about 475 living
   species. Costellariids are most diverse in the tropical Indo-Pacific at
   a depth interval of 0-200 m, where they are largely represented by
   numerous species commonly assigned to the genus Vexillum. The present
   work expands the taxon sampling of a previous phylogeny of the mitriform
   gastropods to resolve earlier problematic relationships, and thus
   establish a robust framework of the family, revise its taxonomy, and
   uncover major trends in the evolution of costellariid morphology. A
   multicuspidate rachidian is shown to have appeared at least twice in the
   evolutionary history of the family: it is regarded as an apomorphy of
   the primarily Indo-Pacific Vexillum-Austromitra-Atlantilux lineage, and
   has evolved independently in the Nodicostellaria-Mitromica lineage of
   the western hemisphere. The genera Ceratoxancus and Latiromitra are
   transferred from the Ptychatractidae to the Costellariidae. Tosapusia,
   Protoelongata, and Pusia are ranked as full genera, the latter with the
   three subgenera Pusia, Ebenomitra, and Vexillena. Vexillum (
   Costellaria) and Zierliana are treated as synonyms of Vexillum. The
   replacement name Suluspira is proposed for Visaya Poppe, Guillot de
   Suduiraut & Tagaro, 2006, non Ahyong, 2004 ( Crustacea). We introduce
   four new genera, Alisimitra, Costapex, Turriplicifer, and Orphanopusia,
   and characterize their anatomy; 14 new species, mostly from deep water
   in the Indo-Pacific, are described in the genera Tosapusia, Alisimitra,
   Costapex, and Pusia. At least two species of Costapex gen. nov. have
   been collected from sunken wood. (C) 2017 The Linnean Society of London,

AB Marine communities vary across spatial scales due to changes in habitat
   structure, wave exposure, depth and anthropogenic activities. Here, we
   quantitatively characterized, for the first time, the reef fish
   assemblages and benthic communities in six sites around Sao Tome Island,
   in the Tropical Eastern Atlantic region. We performed 139 underwater
   visual census and 112 photo-quadrats across six sites around the island
   to explore the relative importance of exposure, depth and topographic
   complexity as drivers of fish and benthic reef communities. Planktivores
   were the most important trophic group, in terms of both fish abundance
   and biomass. Small fishes (0-7 cm) dominated the abundance, whereas
   biomass was mainly concentrated in 8-15 and 16-30 cm body size classes.
   About 30% of the total benthic cover was composed of turf algae and
   circa of 28% of calcareous coralline algae, whereas corals were
   comparably less abundant (only 8%). Among these, Montastraea
   cavernosawas the most abundant coral (46% of the coral cover and 4% of
   total benthic cover). Wave exposure was the most important driver of the
   reef fish assemblages and was also important for benthic communities.
   Also, fish species composition seemed to respond, although weakly, to
   benthic composition. Topographic complexity had little effect on the
   indicators of fish assemblages but seemed to drive some changes in
   benthic cover. Overall, our results evidence the dominance of small
   planktivorous reef fish assemblages and of turf algal communities in Sao
   Tome. Taken together, they support the idea of benthic communities
   shaped by wave action, with minor importance of corals, and of important
   energetic contribution from planktonic material. We also suggest that
   the relatively low biomass of medium and large fish species reflects the
   long-term fishing pressure in Sao Tome Island.

AB Background The dietary habits of the Caribbean have been changing to
   include more fast foods and a less nutrient dense diet. The aims of this
   study are to examine dietary patterns in Barbados and highlight foods
   for a nutritional intervention.
   Methods Four-day food diaries collected from control participants in the
   population-based, case-control Barbados National Cancer Study (BNCS).
   Results Forty-nine adult participants (91% response) completed the
   diaries providing 191 days of dietary data. Total energy intake was
   almost identical to data collected 5-years earlier in the Barbados Food
   Consumption and Anthropometric Survey 2000, but the percent energy
   derived from fat was from 2.1% to 5.2% higher. Sugar intake exceeded the
   Caribbean recommendation almost four-fold, while intakes of calcium,
   iron (women only), zinc and dietary fibre were below recommendations.
   Fish and chicken dishes were the two largest sources of energy and fat.
   Sweetened drinks and juices provided over 40% of total sugar intake.
   Conclusions These data provide existing dietary patterns and strongly
   justify a nutritional intervention program to reduce dietary risk
   factors for chronic disease. The intervention could focus on the
   specific foods highlighted, both regarding frequency and amount of
   consumption. Effectiveness can be evaluated pre- and post-intervention
   using our Food Frequency Questionnaire developed for BNCS.

AB In many countries of the Caribbean, tourism is a mainstay to economies.
   Semi-autonomous Tobago's Buccoo Reef Marine Park (BRMP) was established
   as one of the island's premier tourist attractions. However, the
   increasing and poorly regulated activity in the coastal zone that is
   taking place to complement the burgeoning tourism industry, threatens
   the ecological integrity of the Buccoo Reef. This paper investigates the
   synergies between conservation, sustainable tourism and improving
   societal economic and social well-being. Within a framework that
   recognises the strategic importance of a competitive tourism product, it
   examines how the Buccoo Reef impacts the livelihoods and ongoing
   development in Tobago. It explores the extent and probable causes for
   the Reef's decline. Proposed is how the Park can better achieve
   conservation of the reef ecosystem while encouraging economic and social
   growth on the island, with a goal of more effectively managing and
   sustainably exploiting the coral reef resources of Tobago.

AB Left-eyed flounders of the genus Chascanopsetta Alcock 1894 (Bothidae)
   occur in the Indian, Pacific, and Atlantic oceans at depths ranging from
   120 to 1500 meters. They possess some unique features in bothid fishes
   including a strongly compressed and elongated body and a tremendously
   large mouth. Currently, nine species of Chascanopsetta are recognized,
   and three of them (C. micrognatha Amaoka & Yamamoto 1984, C. lugubris
   Alcock 1894 and C. prognatha Norman 1939) are distributed in the West
   Pacific. We collected 25 specimens of Chascanopsetta during 11
   biodiversity expeditions carried out mainly in the West Pacific. Among
   them, eight specimens taken off Papua New Guinea present morphological
   features that differ from those of the three nominal species known in
   the West Pacific. In this study, we examined these eight specimens of
   unknown affinity and compared their morphology to that of specimens of
   other congeneric species. Results of these comparisons showed that these
   specimens represent an undescribed species of Chascanopsetta, named
   herein, C. novaeguineae sp. nov.. The new species resembles C. elski
   Foroshchuk 1991, which is known only from the Saya de Malha Bank in the
   western Indian Ocean, in having a high number of gill rakers (> 13).
   However, the combination of the following characters further
   distinguishes C. novaeguineae sp. nov. from C. elski: longer jaws,
   narrower interorbital width, and number of pseudobranches (21-25 vs.
   26-27). The DNA sequences from the mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase
   subunit I (COI) gene from C. novaeguineae sp. nov. and other species
   were obtained and compared to confirm its taxonomic status and to infer
   its tentative phylogenetic position within the Chascanopsetta.

AB The European Centre for Medium-Range Forecasts Reanalysis-40 and
   National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP)/Department of
   Energy reanalyses are downscaled over the eastern Caribbean and Lesser
   Antilles using the NCEP-Scripps Regional Spectral Model for Augusts when
   the Atlantic Warm Pool (AWP) area is the most anomalous. The simulations
   show a two-way influence between the Lesser Antilles and the AWP: the
   islands modulate the regional atmospheric circulation, and AWP
   variations modulate the interannual variabilities of the islands. The
   Lesser Antilles introduce diurnal variations and drag to the easterlies.
   The presence of the islands modulates the prevalent easterlies as a
   result of the daytime heating of the islands and the consequent boundary
   layer expansion. The modulations are sensitive to the islands' size and
   topography. Small and flat islands act as thermal plumes, but the
   modulations of large and hilly islands are during the daytime as their
   boundary layer expands. The manifestation of the atmospheric response to
   the sea surface temperature (SST) anomalies over the islands is
   sensitive to the island orography. For most islands, the atmospheric
   response to the SST anomalies is reflected only during the daytime. For
   all one-grid-point islands and Antigua, nighttime and dawn minimum
   temperatures are modulated to the same degree as the daytime maximum.
   For island rainfall, downscaling reduces the gross overestimations of
   rainfall in the reanalyses. However, our downscaling results suggest
   that there is room for improvement in simulating the marine surface
   diurnal cycle.

AB The rodent subfamily the Murinae (Muridae) has its origins in Southeast
   Asia. Ancestral rats migrated down the Indonesian Island chain, across
   Wallace's Line and into the Sahul (Australasian) Region. The genus,
   Melomys, a mosaic-tailed rat (Uromys Division: Hydromyini), has
   representatives in both New Guinea, including outlying islands (four
   species), and Australia (four species). The Australian species are
   thought to be relatively recent arrivals either using New Guinea as a
   staging post, or more likely forming part of a radiation in New Guinea
   prior to migrating to Australia in the Pleistocene. Examination of the
   helminth parasites of Melomys burtoni = M. lutillus and M. rufescens
   from New Guinea and M. burtoni and M. cervinipes from Australia, has
   shown that each host species harbours a diverse fauna. The helminth
   assemblage of M. cervinipes with 33 helminths was the most speciose and
   that of M. rufescens with 16 helminths the least. Nematodes of the genus
   Odilia (Trichostrongylida: Heligmonellidae) were dominant in the
   helminth assemblage of each host species. Each assemblage comprised the
   heirloom species Railietina celebensis (Cestoda: Davaineidae) an old
   souvenir O. mackerrasae together with species new souvenirs or recent
   aquisitions derived from the local context. The helminth assemblage of
   the population of M. burtoni from Papua New Guinea was a small subset of
   the assemblage from Australian hosts and had little commonality with
   that of M. rufescens. This supports an Australian rather than New
   Guinean origin for M. burtoni.

AB A bloom of the hydromedusan jellyfish, Timoides agassizii, occurred in
   February 2011 off the coast of Sohar, Al Batinah, Sultanate of Oman, in
   the Gulf of Oman. This species was first observed in 1902 in great
   numbers off Haddummati Atoll in the Maldive Islands in the Indian Ocean
   and has rarely been seen since. The species appeared briefly in large
   numbers off Oman in 2011 and subsequent observation of our 2009 samples
   of zooplankton from Sohar revealed that it was also present in low
   numbers (two collected) in one sample in 2009; these are the first
   records in the Indian Ocean north of the Maldives. Medusae collected off
   Oman were almost identical to those recorded previously from the Maldive
   Islands, Papua New Guinea, the Marshall Islands, Guam, the South China
   Sea, and Okinawa. T. agassizii is a species that likely lives for
   several months. It was present in our plankton samples together with
   large numbers of the oceanic siphonophore Physalia physalis only during
   a single month's samples, suggesting that the temporary bloom off Oman
   was likely due to the arrival of mature, open ocean medusae into
   nearshore waters. We see no evidence that T. agassizii has established a
   new population along Oman, since if so, it would likely have been
   present in more than one sample period. We are unable to deduce further
   details of the life cycle of this species from blooms of many mature
   individuals nearshore, about a century apart. Examination of a single
   damaged T. agassizii medusa from Guam, calls into question the existence
   of its congener, T. latistyla, known only from a single specimen.

AB The Principe Autonomous Region is recognised as a marine biodiversity
   hotspot, although little is known about the status of its marine fauna.
   It holds most breeding seabirds of the tropical eastern Atlantic Ocean.
   Based on anecdotal accounts of increased fishing and seabird harvesting,
   regular monitoring of seabird populations is considered a priority.
   Therefore, a survey of Principe's seabird colonies was conducted in
   2017. The results revealed that the more accessible seabird colonies
   have disappeared. Around Principe, Bone de Joquei is the present main
   stronghold for Brown Boobies Sula leucogaster and White-tailed
   Tropicbirds Phaethon lepturus. The Tinhosas islands hold an estimated
   300 000 seabirds, predominantly Sooty Terns Onychoprion fuscatus, but
   also Brown Boobies, Black Noddies Anous minutus and Brown Noddies Anous
   stolidus. Long-term multi-annual monitoring is needed to understand the
   breeding phenology of each species and to better assess population
   trends. Ensuring a protective status for both Tinhosas and the seabirds
   under national legislation is a key priority for future conservation
   policy in SAo Tome and Principe.

AB Several African countries in the Western Indian Ocean (WIO) endure
   insufficiencies in the power sector, including both generation and
   distribution. One important step towards increasing energy security and
   availability is to intensify the use of renewable energy sources. The
   access to cost-efficient hydropower is low in coastal and island regions
   and combinations of different renewable energy sources will play an
   increasingly important role. In this study the physical preconditions
   for renewable ocean energy are investigated, considering the specific
   context of the WIO countries. Global-level resource assessments and
   oceanographic literature and data have been compiled in an analysis of
   the match between technology-specific requirements for ocean energy
   technologies (wave power, ocean thermal energy conversion (OTEC), tidal
   barrages, tidal current turbines, and ocean current power) and the
   physical resources in 13 WIO regions Kenya, Seychelles, Northern
   Tanzania and Zanzibar, Southern Tanzania, Comoros and Mayotte,
   Northern-, Central-, and Southern Mozambique, Western-, Eastern-, and
   Southern Madagascar, Reunion, and Mauritius. The results show high
   potential for wave power over vast coastal stretches in southern parts
   of the WIO and high potential for OTEC at specific locations in
   Mozambique, Comoros, Reunion, and Mauritius. The potential for tidal
   power and ocean current power is more restricted but may be of interest
   at some locations. The findings are discussed in relation to currently
   used electricity sources and the potential for solar photovoltaic and
   wind power. Temporal variations in resource intensity as well as the
   differences between small-scale and large-scale applications are
   considered. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB In Palau and everywhere in the world, coastal coral reefs are threatened
   by sedimentation resulting from land clearing in the watersheds. Palau's
   largest island of Babeldaob is particularly susceptible to significant
   erosion due to its steep topography, high rainfall, and highly erodible
   volcanic soil. Previous studies have shown the damaging impacts of
   sedimentation on coral reefs around Babeldaob Island. Related studies
   conducted in Micronesia have also documented that mangroves can trap
   about 30% of the fine eroded sediment from land. This paper examines the
   sediment trapping capability of cultivated wetlands, in particular taro
   (Colocasia esculenta) fields, which are natural wetlands used to grow
   taro, a main staple crop for the population. A 7-months long field study
   was undertaken to quantify the sediment accumulation rate for taro
   fields and to determine their sediment trapping efficiency. The results
   showed that the taro fields were able to trap on average 90% of
   sediment, therefore sheltering coastal coral reefs and their fisheries
   from the negative impacts of terrestrial runoff. Based on the results of
   this study, we suggest that the combined sediment trapping capacity of
   taro fields and mangroves helped reduce sedimentation on coral reefs
   around Babeldaob Island. This enabled human settlement for over 2000
   years on a small Pacific Island with the main staple food being taro for
   starch and reef fish for protein. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

   monthly findings were compared with regional projections; Providing
   Regional Climates for Impact Studies (PRECIS) and a 20 km atmospheric
   global circulation model, and a global projection of the Coupled Model
   Intercomparison Project Phase 3 (CMIP3). Overall, the seasonal and
   decadal results revealed patterns different from the annual warming. All
   the temperature indices were found to have warming patterns with the wet
   season, June to December, generally greater than the dry season, January
   to May. The warmest decade was 1980s, whereas globally, the decade
   2001-2010 was the warmest. There was an increase in the annual maximum 5
   day precipitation, RX5day, at the UWI station. During the dry season
   (1973-2010) at the UFS and UWI stations, the RX5day increased by 8.60
   and 7.76 mm per decade, respectively, while the maximum 1-day
   precipitation, RX1day, increased by 2.92 and 8.90 mm per decade for the
   UFS and UWI, respectively. The 1980s was the wettest, and during the
   decade 2001-2010, there were above averages for the consecutive dry days
   (CDD) and the simple daily intensity index (SDII). The projections on
   both the regional and global outlooks suggest that this warming pattern
   will continue in the future. This small-scale study supports that
   seasonal and decadal analyses, in addition to the annual assessments,
   are significant for the understanding of the climate variability which
   is required for vulnerability and adaptation studies for small island
   states.

   determination of cyanogens. Each mumu exhibited different detoxification
   capacity. The loss of cyanogens in the (coconut) creamed cassava dough
   was lower than in the uncreamed dough. This was more evident when
   coconut cream-cassava mixture was cooked in boiling water than in a
   conventional oven set at 180 degrees C. Certain interactions were
   suspected to exist between the coconut cream and cyanogens or between
   the coconut cream and the appropriate enzymes that are responsible for
   the hydrolysis of the cyanogens. Such interactions resisted the loss of
   cyanogens and/or their quantification by the analytical method. The
   results are discussed in the light of nutritional consequences of such
   interactions, as coconut cream is a popular dietary item in Papua New
   Guinea (and the South Pacific islands).

AB The island mass of Trinidad perturbs the northwestward passage of the
   Guiana Current, inducing a wake and a stationary eddy off the northwest
   coast, in the North Coast Marine Area (NCMA). The oceanography is
   further complicated by the hypoycnal Orinoco Plume. Within the plume,
   Orinoco-derived outflow to the west and exiting Dragon'sMouth abuts
   Amazon-derived water to the east along a front that trends NW from the
   island, east of the wake. Both the front and the eddy are reflected in
   1958 maps of total (live + dead) foraminiferal fauna, Uvigerina parvula
   being more abundant (a) near the front, where convergent flow causes a
   high nutrient flux despite strong current action, and (b) below the
   eddy. The biofacies in nineteen seafloor sediment samples taken in 2010
   north of the eddy but within the NCMA likewise show the front's
   influence. A Cibicidoides norcomarensis n. sp. biofacies, recognized
   from cluster analysis, is developed to the west, beneath sluggishly
   flowing water within the wake. To the east and towards the front is
   developed a U. parvula biofacies. This reflects a higher nutrient flux
   along the front, despite its being within an area of stronger current
   action. Discriminant analysis distinguished these biofacies using only
   four species. Hoeglundina elegans provided the greatest negative
   separation and was more abundant in the C. nornocmarensis biofacies,
   while Eponides regularis, Pullenia subcarinata and Lenticulina
   submamilligera gave approximately equal positive separation. Diversity,
   measured using mean Shannon's H, did not differ between the biofacies.
   There were, however, significant differences between the biofacies in
   mean dominance and in the mean of a benthic foraminiferal productivity
   index (BFPI), calculated from the sum of Bolivina + Bulimina +
   Uvigerina. The results presented here suggest that caution be taken when
   using Cibicidoides spp. andUvigerina spp. to discern areas of higher
   current action and higher nutrient flux respectively at neritic depths
   in the vicinity of offshore fronts, as we found U. parvula within a
   higher flux but stronger current area than Cibicidoides norcomarensis.

AB The Pacific region contains a vast reservoir of genetic material and
   traditional knowledge, and it is of the utmost importance that
   intellectual property rules in the Pacific Islands states support and
   facilitate the conservation and sustainable use of their unique
   biological resources. A significant challenge that needs to be addressed
   in order to promote the effective protection of intellectual property
   rights of genetic resources is the development of appropriate and
   adequate legal, institutional, and scientific support systems to deal
   with the complex issues that instantiate in intellectual property
   protection. The experience with kava and nonu has highlighted the
   inadequacy and inequities of existing laws in the region. This paper
   examines the issues that are associated with intellectual property
   protection, the preservation of traditional knowledge and effective
   access to genetic resources in the Pacific region. Specific reference is
   made to the situation in Papua New Guinea, Fiji and Vanuatu. The paper
   provides a brief outline of current systems of intellectual property
   protection in those Countries, particularly those in relation to
   biodiversity and traditional knowledge. It then addresses the threats
   posed to indigenous culture and livelihood through biopiracy and
   explores regionally-based inter-governmental initiatives regarding
   traditional knowledge that are of common concern through out the region.
   Finally, it briefly canvasses the ways in which the law should be
   developed in the region in the future.

AB Small-scale fisheries are important to livelihoods and subsistence
   seafood consumption of millions of fishers. Sea cucumbers are fished
   worldwide for export to Asia, yet few studies have assessed factors
   affecting socioeconomics and wellbeing among fishers. We interviewed 476
   men and women sea cucumber fishers at multiple villages within multiple
   locations in Fiji, Kiribati, Tonga and New Caledonia using structured
   questionnaires. Low rates of subsistence consumption confirmed a primary
   role of sea cucumbers in income security. Prices of sea cucumbers sold
   by fishers varied greatly among countries, depending on the species.
   Gender variation in landing prices could be due to women catching
   smaller sea cucumbers or because some traders take advantage of them.
   Dissatisfaction with fishery income was common (44% of fishers),
   especially for i-Kiribati fishers, male fishers, and fishers
   experiencing difficulty selling their catch, but was uncorrelated with
   sale prices. Income dissatisfaction worsened with age. The number of
   livelihood activities averaged 2.2-2.5 across countries, and varied
   significantly among locations. Sea cucumbers were often a primary source
   of income to fishers, especially in Tonga. Other common livelihood
   activities were fishing other marine resources, copra production in
   Kiribati, agriculture in Fiji, and salaried jobs in New Caledonia.
   Fishing other coastal and coral reef resources was the most common
   fall-back livelihood option if fishers were forced to exit the fishery.
   Our data highlight large disparities in subsistence consumption,
   gender-related price equity, and livelihood diversity among parallel
   artisanal fisheries. Improvement of supply chains in dispersed
   small-scale fisheries appears as a critical need for enhancing income
   and wellbeing of fishers. Strong evidence for co-dependence among
   small-scale fisheries, through fall-back livelihood preferences of
   fishers, suggests that resource managers must mitigate concomitant
   effects on other fisheries when considering fishery closures. That is
   likely to depend on livelihood diversification programs to take pressure
   off co-dependent fisheries.

AB The studies are performed in isolated areas of Melanesia. Malaria is
   unstable with restricted parasite diversity in Vanuatu, first settled
   4000 years ago, with 120 Austronesian languages, while stable with
   extensive diversity in New Guinea, colonized 40,000 years ago, with 700
   Papuan languages. Higher isolation and lower transmission may result in
   lower diversity and easier development of immunity due to a more
   restricted antigen repertoire. Based on the previous studies in Vanuatu
   and other areas, we hypothesize as follows: (1) clinical manifestations
   of Plasmodium falciparum malaria are limited in severity on islands in
   Vanuatu; and (2) on an isolated island where malaria was temporarily
   eliminated for many years, immunologic memory still remains without
   antigenic stimulation for many years, especially in adults previously
   repeatedly exposed to malaria. Behind these phenotypes we consider the
   following common mechanisms: (1) possible restricted diversity of
   parasites; (2) immunogenetic host and vector properties; and (3)
   interactions between Plasmodium vivax and P. falciparum. To prove these,
   we have a plan to conduct further extensive studies on biodiversities of
   humans, parasites and mosquitoes in relation to environments and the
   implications for malaria control on the island of Melanesia. The results
   will provide evidence of how malaria interventions need to be adjusted
   to local ecological conditions and better understanding of how human,
   parasite and mosquito populations have co-evolved in these isolated
   areas. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB An ongoing survey of macro invertebrates inhabiting the relatively
   unstudied freshwater habitats on 14 small Caribbean islands was
   initiated in 1991. These collections have yielded almost 200 species;
   when these species are combined with collections previously made by
   other researchers, a total of at least 328 freshwater macroinvertebrates
   are now known from these islands. The dominant taxa on the islands
   include several species of snails, shrimps, mayflies, dragonflies,
   damselflies, beetles, and other insects. Many of these species have
   fairly widespread distributions across the islands. Most stream species
   are associated with leaf packs, and most pond species are associated
   with aquatic macrophytes. As is typical of tropical island systems, the
   macroinvertebrate faunas of these islands are sparse, most likely
   because of their oceanic origin, their small size, and the frequent
   disturbances to their freshwater environments.

AB The African Caribbean Pacific (ACP) Sugar Research Programme (SRP), an
   innovative scientific research venture, addresses the technological
   challenges of the sugarcane sector in ACP countries. Thirteen projects
   were undertaken to: research new sugarcane varieties; develop
   co-products; create new sources of revenue; reduce environmental
   impacts; and increase productivity. The ACP-SRP develops networking
   among ACP sugarcane research centres namely the: Mauritius Sugarcane
   Industry Research Institute (Mauritius); Sugar Research Institute of
   Fiji (Fiji); Sugar Industry Research Institute (Jamaica); Technical
   Services of the Swaziland Sugar Association (Swaziland); and West Indies
   Central Sugarcane Breeding Station (Barbados). The ACP-SRP was conceived
   in the early 2000s, projects were approved in 2007, and implementation
   took place from 2010 to 2015. This paper describes the general
   objectives, the main technical activities and results therefrom, for
   each of the projects. Key performance indices (KPIs), based on stated
   technical objectives and times of completion, and the degree to which
   they were met, are presented. The KPIs of 11 of the 13 projects were met
   completely. For the other two projects only some of the KPIs need to be
   completed, mostly because of time constraints. It is concluded that the
   projects have been innovative, non-academic and demand driven.
   Stakeholders have always been involved. Co-products have been valorised;
   there has been potential for industrial application and a number of
   favourable environmental outcomes have emerged. With the current low
   price of sugar on the world market, it is imperative that industries
   within, and even outside the ACP states, become more efficient and
   diversify for niche as well as large-scale markets. The outcomes of the
   ACP-SRP will certainly increase the competitive edge of the sugarcane
   industries of the ACP states. A second programme is being prepared based
   on 53 submitted concept notes.

   Forest, 1965, S. tumidomanus congoensis Crosnier & Forest, 1965 and S.
   minus var. antillensis Coutiere, 1909 are elevated to full species rank,
   becoming S. africanus, S. congoensis, and S. antillensis, respectively.
   Several species are reported for the first time from Panama, Honduras,
   Dominican Republic, Aruba, St. Martin, and Brazil. General taxonomic
   and/or ecological notes are provided for all species treated herein. The
   need for more taxonomic and molecular work is highlighted for the
   western Atlantic S. cf. africanus, S. anasimus Chace, 1972, S. apioceros

AB Since the 1970s, the prevalence of protein-energy malnutrition has
   declined in the countries of Latin America and the Caribbean. However,
   micronutrient deficiencies, especially of iodine, iron, and vitamin A,
   have not diminished to the same extent. Based on clinical criteria,
   vitamin A deficiency continues to be a public health problem in Brazil,
   the Dominican Republic, Ecuador, El Salvador, Guatemala, Haiti,
   Honduras, and Nicaragua. This deficiency is also common in poor
   communities in Bolivia, in some parts of Mexico and Peru, and among
   indigenous groups in Panama. Trends in general health and nutrition
   indicators in Colombia, Cuba, Guyana, Paraguay, and Venezuela suggest
   the need to update information on vitamin A deficiency in those
   countries. At the close of the 1980s, increasing interest was manifested
   in reducing vitamin A deficiency in the Region of the Americas; this
   interest has led to epidemiologic studies, national and regional
   meetings, and the implementation of plans and interventions at the
   local, national, and regional levels. In the medium and long term, a
   permanent solution to the problem of vitamin A deficiency can be
   attained through sustained economic and social development, accompanied
   by specific actions to diversify diets in order to increase consumption
   of foods rich in vitamin A, fortification of popular foods, and
   nutritional education. In the short term, temporary measures--such as
   periodic administration of vitamin A supplements to high-risk
   groups--can be applied.

   assessed by analysis of allele and genotype distributions at 16
   nuclear-encoded microsatellites and mitochondrial (mt)DNA haplotype
   distribution among individuals from five localities in the southern
   Caribbean Sea Tests of homogeneity (microsatellites) revealed a
   genetically disci ere subpopulation (stock) of carite in the Cariaco
   Basin along the northern coast of Venezuelan mainland This subpopulation
   contained a small, highly divergent clade of four mtDNA haplotypes that
   possibly represent recent admixture of formerly isolated subpopulations
   Spatial autocorrelation analysis of the microsatellite data was
   consistent with the notion that carite from Isla de Margarita
   (Venezuela) and Trinidad may warrant management as distinct stocks,
   while spatial autocorrelation analysis and tests of selective neutrality
   of mtDNA variation suggested that carite off the south coast of Trinidad
   differ from carite along the west and north coasts The implication of
   these findings is that there may be a number of spawning stocks of
   carite in the southern Caribbean Sea (C) 2010 Elsevier B V. All rights

TI Fall armyworm migration across the Lesser Antilles and the potential for

AB The fall armyworm, Spodoptera frugiperda (J.E. Smith)(Lepidoptera:
   Noctuidae), is an important agricultural pest of the Western Hemisphere
   noted for its broad host range, long distance flight capabilities, and a
   propensity to develop resistance to pesticides that includes a subset of
   those used in genetically modified corn varieties. These characteristics
   exacerbate the threat fall armyworm poses to agriculture, with the
   potential that a resistance trait arising in one geographical location
   could rapidly disseminate throughout the hemisphere. A region of
   particular concern is the Caribbean, where a line of islands that
   extends from Florida to Venezuela provides a potential migratory pathway
   between populations from North and South America that could allow for
   consistent and substantial genetic interactions. In this study, surveys
   of populations from Peru, Bolivia, Paraguay, and Trinidad & Tobago
   expand on previous work in South America that indicates a generally
   homogeneous population with respect to haplotype markers. This
   population differs from that found in most of the Lesser Antilles where
   a combination of genetic and meteorological observations is described
   that indicate fall armyworm migration from Puerto Rico to as far south
   as Barbados, but does not support significant incursion into Trinidad &
   Tobago and South America. Air transport projections demonstrate that the
   wind patterns in the Caribbean region are not conducive to consistent
   flight along the north-south orientation of the Lesser Antilles,
   supporting the conclusion that such migration is minor and sporadic,
   providing few opportunities for genetic exchanges. The implications of
   these findings on the dissemination of deleterious traits between the
   two Western Hemisphere continents are discussed.

AB Emblemariopsis dianae, new species, is described based on 35 males. It
   is easily distinguished from its congeners by the orange flag distally
   between the first three dorsal fin spines, without a whitish band below
   the flag, and modally three mandibular sensory pores instead of the four
   that are typical of most chaenopsids. The new species exhibits
   significant variation in number of cephalic sensory pores in selected
   series and in details of the caudal skeleton, including variation in the
   only known synapomorphy of the genus Emblemariopsis, the shape and size
   of the neural spine of the penultimate vertebra. The new species has
   been found only in low-energy, mid-shelf, lagoonal waters of the Belize
   Barrier Reef.

AB While the Caribbean is a recognized "biodiversity hotspot", plant
   conservation has not received adequate attention; particularly, given
   the high levels of endemism in many plant groups. Besides establishing
   protected areas, there needs to be a sustained effort to study the
   taxonomy, systematics and ecology of the flora. Recent phylogenetic
   studies have shown high levels of endemism and conservation studies
   indicate a large propotion of the flora is threatened with extinction.
   Eight recommendations are given for plant conservation in the region.

AB Platymantis is a group of neobatrachian frogs that occurs from the
   Philippines to New Guinea - an area situated at the interface between
   the Australian and Asian biogeographical region that is highly
   fragmented by stretches of open sea. Partial sequences of the
   mitochondrial 12S rRNA gene are herein used to infer the relationships
   of species from the Indonesian part of New Guinea (Papua and West Papua
   Province). The phylogenetic trees reveal a deep bifurcation between the
   Asian and Western New Guinean clades being consistent with
   phylogeographic patterns observed in various other faunal groups. While
   most species are well differentiated in the examined locus, low
   interspecific genetic distances between one and three percent were
   observed in the New Guinean species Platymantis papuensis and P.
   cryptotis as well as P. pelewensis from Palau. Platymantis papuensis and
   P. pelewensis are geographically separated from each other by a 1100 km
   stretch of open sea. The minor degree of genetic differentiation between
   both species points to a recent event of transmarine dispersal as
   causation for the occurrence of P. pelewensis on Palau. The low genetic
   differentiation between P. cryptotis and the sympatric P. papuensis, two
   species that are bioacoustically and morphologically distinct, may
   indicate its possibly recent evolutionary origin or, alternatively, yet
   undetected hybridization between the two species. The same may also hold
   true for frogs from Yapen that exhibit calls different from the
   sympatric P. papuensis. Tentatively referred to as Platymantis spec.,
   these frogs are also genetically not well differentiated. It is
   furthermore concluded that the partly low genetic differentiation of the
   New Guinean Platymantis species render this group one of the cases in
   which DNA barcoding would likely fail to produce reliable results.

AB The cholera burden has grown strikingly during the past 4 years, and has
   spread to countries previously spared by this disease. The current
   spread has proved especially violent, as illustrated by the recent
   deadly epidemics around the Lake Chad Basin, in East Africa, and in
   Haiti. This onset of severe cholera epidemics is part of the overall
   dynamic of the current seventh cholera pandemic, composed of successive
   epidemic waves. The current wave is attributable to new atypical El Tor
   strains, which spread from the Bay of Bengal to Papua in the east,
   Africa, and the Caribbean Sea in the west, and caused hundreds of
   thousands of cases and thousands of deaths during each of the last 4
   years. The particular severity of the resulting epidemics is partially
   attributable to the specific characteristics of the atypical El Tor
   strain involved. Besides the abilty of El Tor to spread easily, this
   strain is associated with more severe clinical findings, because of
   elevated levels of toxin secretion resulting from a genetic content
   originating from classical strains. Conversely, recent studies of these
   deadly outbreaks raised hope by illustrating their relationship with
   human-borne dissemination rather than with the resurgence of
   environmental strains. As human-borne dissemination can be more easily
   targeted than ubiquitous environmental contamination, accurate and
   comprehensive epidemiological studies are essential to better understand
   the dynamics of the disease and to optimize future cholera responses.

   included several species of gastropods, decapod crustaceans, odonates,

   St. Kitts and Nevis is sparse, most likely due to their oceanic origins
   and disturbances of their freshwater environments.

   Agriculture" for Papua New Guinea. Breadfruit (Artocarpus altilis) and
   breadnut (A. camansi) clearly fall into the category of crops designated
   as underutilised. The Strategic Framework was developed through an
   extensive series of stakeholder consultations under the leadership of
   the Global Facilitation Unit for Underutilised Species (GFU), Bioversity
   International and the International Centre for Underutilised Crops. The
   national study was conducted by the PNG National Agricultural Research

AB Insects and terrestrial invertebrates are presumed to have consistently
   contributed to the diet of our ancestors and it is estimated that 1386
   insects are still adopted worldwide for human nutrition. As elsewhere in
   the tropical world, insects are a part of the diet of Irian Jaya
   populations. The distribution of insect food consumption on the western
   side of New Guinea island follows different patterns, according to the
   environment and to population subsistence economy.
   In the forest biome of the periferic mountain areas, many different
   insect species are collected in small numbers, mainly by women and
   children. Insect collection occurs by chance but probably helps these
   subjects, the most vulnerable to possible food-shortages, to complement
   their diet with some extra proteins and fats.
   In the western lowlands, a complex cultural system is centered around
   the traditional staple: sago (Metroxylon sagu and rumphii). The pit of
   this palm, which grows spontaneously in the swampy forest plains,
   contains a high amount of starch and is easily gathered by the local
   people. A beetle (Rhynchophorus ferrugineus papuanus) is strictly linked
   to the sage palm and oviposits especially on damaged or felled
   specimens. Villagers manage the sage palms in order to increase palmworm
   oviposition and to collect a consistent number of larvae about 6 weeks
   later. This ancient sage culture, favoured by an abundant and reliable
   resource, has developed a rich ceremonial life connected with sage
   larvae consumption.
   Ecologic, economic and cultural factors influencing the variety of
   insect consumption modalities are taken into account. The development of
   local, small-scale invertebrate breeding systems can contribute to the
   development of sustainable, renewable resources and protect tropical
   forests from degradation.

AB The Caribbean is a biodiversity hotspot for photosynthetic sea slugs,
   with about 27 described species in the genus ElysiaRisso, 1818. However,
   many species are poorly known or have complex taxonomic histories,
   complicating assessments of regional biodiversity and impeding studies
   of plastid symbiosis, speciation, and larval biology. Using an
   integrative approach, we address the taxonomy and systematics of
   Caribbean elysiids by performing robust tests of existing species
   hypotheses, and describe six new species. Species delimitation included
   DNA barcoding of up to 189 nominal conspecific specimens; nuclear gene
   sequences were then used to confirm that divergent lineages were
   genetically distinct candidate species. New synonymies and species
   descriptions are based on external anatomy, penial and radular
   morphology, developmental characters, and host ecology of all species
   described from the region, plus a critical review of the literature. We
   synonymized three species (Elysia annedupontae Ortea, Espinosa &
   Caballer in Ortea, Caballer, Moro & Espinosa, 2005, Elysia clarki Pierce
   et al. 2006, and Elysia leeanneae Caballer, Ortea & Espinosa in Ortea,
   Espinosa, Buske & Caballer, 2013), transfered one species from Bosellia
   (Elysia marcusi), and described six new species (Elysia pawliki n. sp.,
   Elysia zemi n. sp., Elysia christinae n. sp., Elysia hamanni n. sp.,
   Elysia taino n. sp., and Elysia buonoi n. sp.). We resurrected the name
   Elysia velutinus Pruvot-Fol, 1947, a senior synonym of Elysia tuca Ev.
   Marcus & Er. Marcus, 1967. Based on a four-gene phylogeny of 76 Elysia
   spp., we identified shifts in host use and penial armature that may
   explain patterns of endemic diversification in Elysia, invoking both
   ecological and non-ecological mechanisms. Non-monophyly of styletbearing
   species rejects previous attempts to classify species based on presence
   of a stylet (i.e., the genus Checholysia Ortea, Caballer, Moro &
   Espinosa, 2005). Our findings show how integrative approaches can
   resolve the taxonomic status of problematic species (e.g., Elysia
   papillosa Verrill, 1901) for soft-bodied marine taxa.

AB The tropical-subtropical western Atlantic realm harbours abundant
   fringing reefs, two major barrier reefs (Belize, Florida), several
   atolls and large reef-fringed carbonate platforms (Bahamas). Data from
   Belize and south Florida indicate that major barrier reefs were
   established during the high sea-levels of the long and warm marine
   isotope stage 11. Reefs formed during Pleistocene sea-level highstands,
   whereas erosion, non-deposition and the formation of subaerial exposure
   surfaces prevailed during lowstands of sea-level (Florida, Bahamas);
   exposed reefs and platforms with siliciclastic hinterlands were
   characterized by deposition of clays and sands on fluvial plains
   (Belize). Elevated terraces and outcrops of reefs of the last
   interglacial of marine isotope stage 5e are evidence of higher than
   present sea-level and temperature that sustained large reef-fringed
   carbonate platforms and ramps in the Florida-Bahamas region and Central
   America (Belize, Mexico), including ooid deposition in warm and shallow
   waters. During the highstands of marine isotope stages 5c and 5a, at
   sea-levels several metres lower than today, fringing reefs developed in
   parts of the Caribbean, for example, in south Florida (outlier reefs').
   Data from the island of Barbados support the contention that the
   postglacial sea-level rise from about -120m was rapid and punctuated by
   two meltwater pulses Ia and Ib, which bracket the beginning and end of
   the Younger Dryas, respectively. After reflooding of shelves in the
   early Holocene, reefs developed preferentially on highs of the
   underlying karstified Pleistocene limestone surface and on former river
   channel bars. Many reefs in the western Atlantic region kept pace with
   Holocene sea-level rise whereas some were drowned. Reasons for reef
   drowning are debated and include sea-level rise, elevation of antecedent
   topography, and deterioration of environmental conditions such as high
   nutrient input. Apart from sea-level and antecedent topography, factors
   such as exposure to waves and currents, storms, and sedimentation have
   controlled reef development. The historical decline of acroporid corals
   in the Caribbean realm has been attributed to cooling following the
   Holocene thermal optimum; however, historical die-offs of reef-building
   corals and other reef organisms suggest that some if not all recent
   declines were unprecedented during the Holocene. Rising temperatures,
   decreasing carbonate saturation, increased frequency of major storms,
   high nutrient concentrations and sedimentation, overfishing, and disease
   certainly played a role in decline, but systematic studies relating
   these environmental factors to Holocene reef-building are only in the
   early stages.

AB The coconut rhinoceros beetle (CRB; Oryctes rhinoceros) is a major pest
   of coconut and oil palm, but the discovery and release of Oryctes
   rhinoceros nudivirus (OrNV) in the 1960s and 70s suppressed the pest
   such that no new invasions of uninfested islands by CRB were reported
   for over 30 years after implementation of the biocontrol programme.
   Surprisingly, a highly damaging outbreak was reported from Guam (2007),
   which could not be controlled by OrNV. Subsequently, new invasions have
   been reported from Port Moresby, Papua New Guinea (2009); O'ahu, Hawai'i
   (2013); and Honiara, Solomon Islands (2015). We have found that all of
   these outbreaks have been caused by a previously unrecognized haplotype,
   CRB-G, which appears to be tolerant to OrNV. PCR analysis shows that
   OrNV is generally present at high incidence in established populations
   of CRB, but is generally absent from the invasive CRB-G populations.
   CRB-G from Guam was not susceptible to OrNV infection by oral delivery,
   but injection of the virus did cause mortality. Further genetic analysis
   shows that CRB populations can be divided into a number of clades that
   coincide with the endemic and invasive history of the beetle. Analysis
   suggests that CRB-G originated in Asia, though the precise location
   remains to be discovered.

AB Amblyomma variegatum tick infestation, tick infection by Ehrlichia
   ruminantium (ER), and ER genetic diversity were studied in the Caribbean
   Islands of Guadeloupe, Marie-Galante, and Antigua between 2003 and 2005.
   Nested PCR for pCS20 was used to detect ER, while ER strains were
   characterized by sequencing or by restriction fragment length
   polymorphism (RFLP) profiles of map-1 PCR products. In 2003 in
   Guadeloupe, the prevalence of tick-infested herds was 35.6%. In
   Marie-Galante 79.1% of herds in 2003 and 73.8% in 2005 were infested,
   while only an average of 2.2% of the herds were infected in Antigua
   between this same period. In Marie-Galante, 19.1% of ticks were ER
   positive, and ER-infected ticks were found in 33.3% of the herds. In
   Antigua only 5.8% of the ticks were ER positive. High ER tick infection
   rate combined with a very high level of tick infestation highlight the
   risk of heartwater in Marie-Galante and Guadeloupe more than in Antigua.
   The three islands still represent a reservoir for tick and heartwater in
   the Caribbean. Nine different African and Caribbean map-1 ER genotypes
   were identified. This diversity was observed even in restricted areas,
   and identical map-1 genotypes were observed on all three islands. This
   high genetic diversity of ER strains suggests that there was a
   simultaneous introduction of several strains from African countries into
   the Caribbean region.

AB We present late Quaternary records of metastable carbonate dissolution
   determined for sediment cores recovered from intermediate water depths
   on the Nicaragua Rise (Caribbean Sea, 1000-1894 m) and near the Bahama
   Banks (western North Atlantic Ocean, 655 and 1934 m). Upper North
   Atlantic Deep Water is believed to dominate these two regions at
   present. Both areas are predicted to be good locations to study past
   variations of average middepth Atlantic chemistry and circulation.
   However, statistical analyses of metastable carbonate dissolution
   indices (% Mg calcite, pteropod abundance, % whole pteropods, and %
   clear pteropods) yielded a composite dissolution index (CDI) which
   displays different carbonate dissolution histories for Bahama and
   Nicaragua Rise sediments. The Bahama records resemble deep Atlantic
   carbonate records with dissolution during glacial oxygen isotope stages
   6 and 4 and with preservation during interglacial stages 5 and 1. We
   observe two dissolution patterns at intermediate water depths of the
   Caribbean. The ''deep'' intermediate water pattern (1200-1894 m)
   resembles deep Caribbean carbonate records with dissolution during
   interglacial periods and preservation during glacial intervals. The
   ''shallow'' intermediate water record (<1200 m) resembles at times the
   Bahamas record and at other times the deep Caribbean record. These CDI
   records suggest that different water masses occupied the intermediate
   depth western North Atlantic and Caribbean during much of the late
   Quaternary. Observed differences between these regions may be related to
   variations in the flow of nutrient-rich, low CO3= Antarctic Intermediate
   Water through the Caribbean or to changes in the ventilation rate of
   equatorial thermocline and intermediate waters. These water-mass
   variations have influenced Caribbean carbon chemistry from the base of
   the thermocline down to abyssal water depths and may have had a
   significant effect on North Atlantic circulation and nutrients.

AB The phylogenetic relationships amongst the Arminidae were analysed based
   upon morphological characters of 58 presently described species or
   nudibranchs, including 35 previously described Arminidae and 20 new
   species of Dermatobranchus. From the literature review and anatomical
   examinations, 43 characters were considered for 78 taxa. These
   characters were polarized using Berthella canariensis as the outgroup
   taxon and the type species of several other genera identified from
   recent publications. The resulting phylogeny supports the monophyly of
   Arminidae, Dermatobranchus, Doridina, and Proctonotidae. The paraphyly
   of the Arminina is further demonstrated in this study. Two previously
   described, but poorly known, species of Indo-Pacific Armina are
   redescribed, Armina magna Baba, 1955 and Armina paucifoliata Baba, 1955.
   The anatomy and taxonomic status of nine previously described species of
   Dermatobranchus were examined in this study. The anatomy of
   Dermatobranchus pustulosus (van Hasselt, 1824) has been overlooked since
   Bergh (1888) illustrated the radula of van Hasselt's specimen. It is
   redescribed and its range is extended to several new localities in the
   western Pacific. Dermatobranchus pulcherrimus Miller & Willan, 1986 is
   considered here as a new synonym of Dermatobranchus rubidus (Gould,
   1852). The following 20 species of Dermatobranchus are new and are
   described in the present paper: Dermatobranchus albineus sp. nov.,
   Dermatobranchus arminus sp. nov., Dermatobranchus caesitius sp. nov.,
   Dermatobranchus caeruleomaculatus sp. nov., Dermatobranchus cymatilis

   piperoides sp. nov., Dermatobranchus rodmani sp. nov., Dermatobranchus
   semilunus sp. nov., and Dermatobranchus tuberculatus sp. nov. Eighteen
   of these new taxa are found in the Indo-Pacific tropics and two are
   found in temperate South Africa, D. albineus and D. arminus. Unique
   combinations of morphological characters distinguish these as new
   species of Dermatobranchus. Several species that are externally similar
   have radically divergent internal morphology, are members of different
   clades of Dermatobranchus, and represent cryptic species. Especially
   important is the radular morphology, which shows remarkable diversity of
   form, probably related directly to the diversification of feeding of
   members of this clade on various octocorals. (C) 2011 The Linnean

AB Anthropogenic habitat changes and the introduction of pigs, dogs, cats
   and rats have caused a catastrophic decline in the terrestrial
   biodiversity of Pacific archipelagos. At present, economic globalization
   and an increased demand for timber are promoting industrial logging and
   plantation expansion. Commercial logging can be sustainable but in
   practice it more often leads to land degradation, especially on small
   flat islands. On large and mountainous islands, however, more modest
   impacts can be expected as the narrowly endemic species tend to inhabit
   montane forests where logging is difficult. In this study we use
   ornithological data collected at different elevations to assess the
   extent to which the avifauna of Makira, a large mountainous island in
   Melanesia, will be affected by deforestation of the lowlands, most of
   which are under timber concessions. Our data suggest that a majority of
   the endemic bird species use lowland forest to some extent and that this
   may even apply to species hitherto associated with montane forest. If
   current commercial forestry programmes are continued, the forest habitat
   may be disturbed or lost over large parts of Makira, potentially
   undermining the natural resource base for the local subsistence economy,
   exacerbating climate change and threatening the integrity of one of the
   most important areas for biodiversity conservation on earth. Our study
   highlights the importance of understanding the habitat requirements of
   endemic species and the urgency of establishing and effectively managing
   community-based protected areas in suitable lowland forests of the
   Pacific.

   Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). It is the first time
   the talks have been headed by a Small Island Developing States (SIDS),
   and Fiji's Prime Minister, Voreqe Bainimarama, plans to use the 23rd
   Conference of Parties (COP23) to highlight the impacts of climate change
   on island states. Even as Pacific island leaders demand greater action
   to reduce emissions, the Australian government is supporting new coal
   mines at home and a dramatic increase in coal exports. This commentary
   focuses on Pacific leadership in the global fight to avoid catastrophic
   changes to the climate system. It suggests determined diplomacy by
   island states may help shift international opinion in favour of urgent
   action to reduce emissions. However, Pacific states must first shine a
   spotlight on their recalcitrant neighbour, and avoid being silenced by
   Australian 'climate diplomacy'.

AB Background: Noncommunicable diseases are a health and development
   challenge. Pacific Island countries are heavily affected by NCDs, with
   diabetes and obesity rates among the highest in the world. Trade is one
   of multiple structural drivers of NCDs in the Pacific, but country-level
   data linking trade, diets and NCD risk factors are scarce. We attempted
   to illustrate these links in five countries. The study had three
   objectives: generate cross-country profiles of food consumption and
   expenditure patterns; highlight the main 'unhealthy' food imports in
   each country to inform targeted policymaking; and demonstrate the
   potential of HCES data to analyze links between trade, diets and NCD
   risk factors, such as obesity.
   Methods: We used two types of data: obesity rates as reported by WHO and
   aggregated household-level food expenditure and consumption from
   Household Income and Expenditure Survey reports. We classified foods in
   HIES data into four categories: imported/local, 'unhealthy'/'healthy',
   nontraditional/traditional, processed/unprocessed. We generated
   cross-country profiles and cross-country regressions to examine the
   relationships between imported foods and unhealthy foods, and between
   imported foods and obesity.
   Results: Expenditure on imported foods was considerable in all countries
   but varied across countries, with highest values in Kiribati (53%) and
   Tonga (52%) and lowest values in Solomon Islands and Vanuatu (30%). Rice
   and sugar accounted for significant amounts of imported foods in terms
   of expenditure and calories, ranking among the top 3 foods in most
   countries. We found significant or near-significant associations in
   expenditure and caloric intake between 'unhealthy' and imported foods as
   well as between imported foods and obesity, though inferences based on
   these associations should be made carefully due to data constraints.
   Conclusions: While additional research is needed, this study supports
   previous findings on trade as a structural driver of NCD risk and
   identifies the top imported foods that could serve as policy targets.
   Moreover, this analysis is proof-of-concept that the methodology is a
   cost-effective way for countries to use existing data to generate
   policy-relevant evidence on links between trade and NCDs. We believe
   that the methodology is replicable to other countries globally. A
   user-friendly Excel tool is available upon request to assist such
   analyses.

AB Some excavating sponges of the genus Cliona compete with live reef
   corals, often killing and bioeroding entire colonies. Important aspects
   affecting distribution of these species, such as dispersal capability
   and population structure, remain largely unknown. Thus, the aim of this
   study was to determine levels of genetic connectivity and dispersal of
   Cliona delitrix across the Greater Caribbean (Caribbean Sea, Bahamas and
   Florida), to understand current patterns and possible future trends in
   their distribution and effects on coral reefs. Using ten
   species-specific microsatellite markers, we found high levels of genetic
   differentiation between six genetically distinct populations: one in the
   Atlantic (Florida-Bahamas), one specific to Florida and four in the
   South Caribbean Sea. In Florida, two independent breeding populations
   are likely separated by depth. Gene flow and ecological dispersal occur
   among other populations in the Florida reef tract, and between some
   Florida locations and the Bahamas. Similarly, gene flow occurs between
   populations in the South Caribbean Sea, but appears restricted between
   the Caribbean Sea and the Atlantic (Florida-Bahamas). Dispersal of
   C.delitrix was farther than expected for a marine sponge and favoured in
   areas where currents are strong enough to transport sponge eggs or
   larvae over longer distances. Our results support the influence of ocean
   current patterns on genetic connectivity, and constitute a baseline to
   monitor future C. delitrix trends under climate change.

AB In the Southern Hemisphere, humpback whales Megaptera novaeangliae feed
   in Antarctic waters during the austral summer and migrate to their
   breeding grounds in subtropical and tropical waters during the winter.
   Historical whaling records suggest that the Archipelago of Sao Tome and
   Principe, located in the Gulf of Guinea, serves as a possible breeding
   ground. In order to investigate the temporal occurrence and group
   composition of humpback whales around Sao Tome Island, annual surveys
   were conducted during the breeding season between 2002 and 2006. A total
   of 186 boat-based surveys took place during this period. Data collected
   during each sighting included geographical positions, group size, group
   composition and behavioural classifications. Of the 66 groups
   encountered, mother/calf pairs made up a large proportion (65.15%),
   followed by solitary individuals (15.15%). Mother/calf pairs were seen
   in the region into November and resightings of identified animals
   indicate periods of occupancy that extended over three weeks. Few
   behaviours typically associated with mating activity were observed.
   Given the high percentage of mother/calf pairs, sometimes with very
   young calves, and the low frequency of mating activity, the waters of
   Sao Tome may primarily serve as a calving and nursing or resting area
   for humpback whales.

AB This study explores spatial distribution, species diversity, and

   from San Salvador Island, Bahamas. Using a hierarchical sampling
   approach, 17,703 intertidal gastropod specimens representing 9 genera
   and 15 species were recorded from 480 quadrats along 120 transects at 40
   sites sampled at ten localities around the island. All localities are
   dominated by several species of littorinids and neritids. The
   rank-abundance structure was comparable across all localities, with the
   same species dominating at all but one locality. The hierarchical
   sampling scheme revealed a gradual increase in diversity across sampling
   levels, with most notable increase observed between site-level and
   locality-level diversity estimates. Habitat diversity estimates did not
   vary from bare and exposed surfaces to sheltered pits, crevices, and
   tide pools. Across energy regimes, there was no meaningful shift in
   habitat occurrences to more sheltered, protected habitats. Species
   occurrences in sheltered habitats should augment fossilization potential
   of those assemblages because, as shown in some paleontological studies,
   there is evidence of rocky intertidal environments from such settings as
   tide pools, pits, and crevices. Indeed, when data are restricted to more
   preservable, sheltered settings only, a good representation of total
   biodiversity and overall community structure of sampled faunal
   associations is still retained. Moreover, because the sampled
   communities appear remarkably homogeneous across and within localities,
   even a highly fragmentary fossil record (e.g., small area in one
   locality) would likely collect a substantial fraction of biodiversity
   and community structure of rocky intertidal communities of San Salvador
   Island.

AB Fungi are everywhere but mycologists are not and the fungi anamorphici,
   which includes hyphomycetes and coelomycetes, is an under-studied group
   in Australasia. It is the second largest group of fungi and its members
   play an important role in nutrient cycling. Plant pathogenic species are
   the best-documented and fungi anamorphici feature prominently in lists
   of plant diseases for Australia, New Zealand and the Pacific Islands.
   The few resident mycologists specialising in taxonomy and systematics of
   fungi anamorphici have made major advances in the study of plant
   pathogens (e.g. Bipolaris, Fusarium) and those of industrial importance
   (e.g. Penicillium). Visiting mycologists who have made significant
   collections of Australasian fungi anamorphici include B. C. Sutton in
   Australia, S. J. Hughes in New Zealand and T. Matsushima in Australia,
   Papua New Guinea and the Solomon Islands. A census of fungi anamorphici
   is being prepared for Fungi of Australia and a database of all species
   recorded from New Zealand is being compiled. Australasian studies of
   fungi anamorphici in freshwater and marine environments and those
   associated with arthropods are discussed. Rainforests and numerous other
   habitats in Australasia remain a vast storehouse of unknown fungi
   anamorphici-thousands of species yet to be collected, classified and
   described.

AB PREMISE OF THE STUDY: The Western Indian Ocean Region (WIOR) is a
   biodiversity hotspot providing an ideal setting for exploring the
   origins of insular biodiversity and dynamics of island colonization. We
   aimed to investigate the origins of the WIOR Psychotrieae alliance
   (Rubiaceae) with typically small, probably mainly bird-dispersed drupes,
   and the timing and direction or sequence of its colonization events in
   the region.
   METHODS: We used the program BEAST to estimate divergence times and
   Lagrange for biogeographic reconstruction.
   KEY RESULTS: The alliance has reached the WIOR at least 14 times via
   dispersals from Africa along with Asia and the Pacific mostly during the
   last 10 My, with at least one back-colonization to Africa. We inferred
   the earliest dispersal to Madagascar from the Pacific or Asia in the
   Miocene and numerous out-of-Madagascar dispersals to the nearby
   archipelagos but no dispersal out of those archipelagos. Gynochthodes
   with multiple fruits reached Madagascar twice from the Pacific possibly
   via ocean drifting. Psychotria with dry fruits (schizocarps) colonized
   Madagascar from the Pacific or Asia before reaching the Comoros from
   Madagascar possibly via wind dispersal.
   CONCLUSIONS: This study reinforces the pivotal role of dispersal in
   shaping the WIOR biodiversity and as the critical initiating step in the
   generation of endemic biodiversity on its islands. The WIOR alliance
   shows strong Asian and Pacific affinities despite the proximity of the
   region to Africa. Madagascar has served as a stepping-stone for
   subsequent dispersal to the rest of the region. The
   Afro-Malagasy-Seychelles genus Craterispermum and the Malagasy Puffia
   may represent relictual lineages.

AB We present a simple modelling method to estimate the volume of available
   groundwater in the freshwater lens of atoll islands under steady-state
   conditions. Model inputs include annual rainfall depth, island width for
   cross-sections along the length of the island, aquifer hydraulic
   conductivity, and depth to the contact between the upper sand aquifer
   and the lower limestone aquifer. The methodology is tested for nine
   islands of varying size in the Maldives and Micronesia. Sensitivity
   analysis indicates that lens volume on large islands typically is
   governed by the depth to the discontinuity, whereas lens volume for
   smaller islands is governed by rainfall rate and hydraulic conductivity.
   Volume curves, which relate lens volume to lens thickness, are developed
   for each of the nine islands and for three generic island shapes to
   allow rapid estimation of lens volume given field-estimated lens
   thickness. The methods presented in this study can be used for any small
   atoll island.

AB Four individuals of the non-marine polychaete, Namanereis hummelincki,
   were collected from two deep (70-80 m) wells on Barbados; the largest
   specimen measured 2.2 cm long and 0.1 cm wide, and had 82 setigerous
   segments. These wells access the vast underground freshwater aquifer
   beneath the island, are 9 km apart, and are between 3.7 and 4 km from
   the coast. Water temperature in the wells was 26.5C, pH was between 7.4
   and 7.5, and salinity was between 1 and 2 ppt, indicating some saltwater
   intrusion. N. hummelincki belongs to a monophyletic group, comprising 13
   species and 2 species groups, that has a circumpolar
   tropical/subtropical distribution. Some species are widespread, whereas
   others are known only from a single locality. Nine species occur in the
   Caribbean, and of these 5, including N. hummelincki, appear to be
   endemic to this region. Seven species lack eyes, and this trait is
   strongly correlated with subterranean habitats. Little is known of the
   biology of N. hummelincki but the Barbadian population likely feeds on
   members of the well meiofauna, which includes copeopods and oribatid
   mites. The species is dioecious and may brood its eggs within the
   coelomic cavity. Populations are known to occur on five other islands:
   Bonaire and Curacao to the southwest, and Jamaica, Hispaniola, and Cuba
   to the northwest. If the colonization of Barbados by N. hummelincki has
   been through natural dispersal it likely occurred in the
   Pliocene/Pleistocene, when Barbados was connected to mainland North and
   South America.

AB Purpose For Small Island Developing States (SIDS), achieving export
   manufacturing competitiveness is a major challenge. This paper aims to
   provide a framework that can be used to study the export competitiveness
   for food manufacturers.
   Design/methodology/approach The revealed comparative export advantage
   (RXA) and the constant market share (CMS) measures are used in a case
   study set in the Trinidad and Tobago's food and beverage sector to study
   export manufacturing competitiveness.
   Findings When using the RXA and CMS measures to assess the current state
   of export manufacturing competitiveness in SIDS, specific product
   groupings should be used in the analysis to obtain a more accurate
   assessment of competitiveness than that provided when using aggregate
   commodity groups. Furthermore, the export market section of the
   conceptual framework provides a structured approach towards studying the
   distribution effect element of the CMS analysis.
   Research limitations/implications Trade data are heavily used, which is
   subject to a number of well-documented limitations. In addition, there
   is no mandatory registration for companies operating in the case
   country, which results in under-reporting of industrial activity, and so
   limits the use of the framework in studying the exporting companies and
   the export products. Finally, a single case study limits the
   generalizability of the findings.
   Practical implications In particular, policymakers responsible for
   designing interventions for increasing export manufacturing
   competitiveness can use the framework to consider specific strategies as
   they relate to the exporting companies, the export products and the
   export markets.
   Originality/value This paper brings together three basic elements that
   contribute to export manufacturing competitiveness in the form of the
   conceptual framework.

AB Sago starch is an important food in lowland Papua New Guinea. Extraction
   of the starch from the palm and storage were performed by way of
   traditional methods that have been used for thousands of years.
   Currently, very little is known about the microbiology of sago starch.
   Sago samples were collected from areas of high starch utilization and
   analyzed for the presence of bacterial pathogens and indicator
   organisms. Storage methods and duration were recorded at the time of
   collection, and pH and water activity on arrival at the laboratory. Sago
   starch was found to harbor high levels of fecal contamination, as well
   as various food pathogens including Salmonella, Bacillus cereus, and
   coagulase-positive staphylococci. Clostridium perfringens was only
   present infrequently in samples and in very low numbers, while Listeria
   monocytogenes was not isolated from sago starch. The presence of high
   levels of fecal contamination in sago starch is of particular concern,
   and may contribute to diarrheal disease in rural Papua New Guinea.

AB Some 44% of the world's population lives within 150 km of the coast and
   mass migration towards the coast will continue in the decades ahead.
   Degrading and exhaustive uses of land, water and other coastal resources
   and disruption of environmental processes through degradation of
   environmental quality and loss of critical terrestrial and aquatic
   habitats can lead to serious deleterious impacts on the health and
   productivity of coastal ecosystems. Following the Arusha Resolution
   (1993), the Seychelles Statement (1996) and the Colombo CZM Workshop
   (1999), the need for integrated coastal zone management has become
   critical because of the limited land resources and unproportional
   domination of coastal areas in the wider Caribbean and Indian
   Ocean/Pacific island states. The coastal zone of Mauritius (1,850 km(2),
   20 degrees S, 58 degrees E, south-western Indian Ocean, 1.12 million
   inhabitants) was redefined in 1997 in the Environmental Protection Act
   of 1991 [Part VII (Act 34)] to include all islets within the Exclusive
   Economic Zone (EEZ; 1.7 million km 2). During the 1980s, the Mauritian
   economy underwent major structural changes successfully, with a rapid
   phase of industrialization diversifying into two major activities,
   textiles and tourism. Existing reports and data in a common framework
   have to be synthesized and organized to fill existing gaps in knowledge
   with data collection and scientific inquiries, to identify social and
   economic drivers and to relate socioeconomic change to demands for
   environmental resources (land use, water resources, marine systems) and
   environmental impacts as proposed under the MERMAID (Mauritius
   Environmental Resource Management and Industrial Development) project.
   Nutrient flux and sediment trace metal contamination studies are
   currently underway to investigate different watersheds impacted by
   agricultural, urban and industrial activities in the north-west of the
   island. There is a pressing need to integrate the natural sciences with
   socioeconomic disciplines as proposed by the International Human
   Dimensions Program (IHDP) for an integrated management of coastal zones.
   Three integrated pilot projects in the Pacific-Indian Ocean and wider
   Caribbean as identified by Land Ocean Interaction in the Coastal Zone
   (LOICZ) in the future, including current status and changes in material
   fluxes from drainage basins, transboundary impacts from the ocean and
   atmospheric inputs, could elucidate the land-sea interactions and human
   dimensions of change on small islands. The sustainability of marine
   resources and the conservation of biological diversity will depend on a
   critical understanding of linkages between human activities and
   ecological responses and upon a citizenry that assumes ownership of
   these regions. Case studies would also help in investigating how humans
   affect transport pathways and biogeochemical cycles in small island
   states.

AB Physical scarcity of freshwater is often given as the reason for water
   shortages, but it is usually its management that can either create or
   resolve the problem. This will be illustrated by the case of Barbados.
   The water management issues are typical of many small island states,
   some of which are particularly vulnerable to water scarcity, especially
   in the context of climate change. Barbados experiences extended
   interruptions in the water supply, mainly in northern and eastern
   parishes. Supplies of freshwater are relatively sparse, but it will be
   argued that it is the policy regime that ensures that water is
   inefficiently supplied, allocated and used, and so is the primary cause
   of supply interruptions. The objectives of this paper are to establish a
   theoretical framework for sustainable water resource management and
   frame a strategy for Barbados which reconciles demand and supply of
   water while taking into account environmental, economic and social
   interests. The mixed methodology involved semi-structured interviews of
   policy makers and practitioners from the water, tourism, agriculture and
   planning sectors, as well as a household survey.

AB Estimates of household size economies are needed for the analysis of
   poverty and inequality. This paper shows that Engel estimates of size
   economies are large when household expenditures are obtained by
   respondent recall but small when expenditures are obtained by daily
   recording in diaries. Expenditure estimates from recall surveys appear
   to have measurement errors correlated with household size. As well as
   demonstrating the fragility of Engel estimates of size economies, these
   results help resolve a puzzle raised by Deaton and Paxson (1998) about
   differences between rich and poor countries in the effect of household
   size on food demand.

AB Previous investigative work related to solar stills focuses mainly on
   issues relating to the temperature gradient between the brine and the
   condensing surface. It is common practice when calculating the
   efficiencies of solar stills to use the temperature of the outer glass
   as the condensing surface temperature rather than the temperature of the
   actual condensing surface. This practice is done due to the fact that
   the outer glass surface temperature is easily measurable and on the
   assumption that there is little or no drop in temperature across the
   thickness of the cover. These conventions in turn create room for
   misleading results owing to temperature losses across the cover
   thickness. The main objectives of this research work are to investigate
   the effect of using different glass cover thicknesses and different
   solar still orientations on the productivity of cascade-type solar
   stills tested under tropical Caribbean climatic conditions. In the
   investigation, three identical units fitted with glass covers of
   thicknesses 3.18, 4.76 and 6.35 mm are used. Each unit comprised two
   identical solar stills: one oriented to face north and the other to face
   south. Results were gathered at the University of the West Indies in St.
   Augustine, Trinidad and comparative analyses were conducted. The results
   indicate that the solar still with the glass cover thickness of 4.76 mm
   facing south produced the highest yield.

AB Tax incentives are preferential tax treatments provided to selected
   groups of taxpayers and usually result in those taxpayers paying less
   tax or paying later than they otherwise would.
   Tax incentives for the petroleum sector are questioned to ascertain
   whether they are economically beneficial for four selected jurisdictions
   in the Asia-Pacific region: Australia, Malaysia, Indonesia and Papua New
   Guinea. Within this inquiry, a further minor research question considers
   the competing aims inherent in any energy policy of economics, politics
   and the environment. The research intent is to provide energy policy
   implications of proposed changes to tax incentives. A qualitative
   research approach is used with analysis through the energy justice
   principles of availability, affordability, due process, transparency and
   accountability, sustainability, responsibility and intra- and
   inter-generational equity. Case studies on tax incentives from the
   selected jurisdictions are compared for trends and to determine any
   nexus with levels of foreign direct investment in resource exploration
   and development. The article seeks documentary evidence that summarizes
   and quantifies the value of tax incentives (known in the tax field as
   tax expenditures). Findings reveal that best practice is that of lower
   levels of legislated and discretionary tax incentives for the extractive
   sector. Energy policy-makers should limit tax breaks to rare exceptions
   in resource -rich countries.

AB The gastropod genus Conus is shown to be among many marine taxa that
   attain maximal known diversity along the northeast coast of Papua New
   Guinea. Thirty-six species co-occurred on the reef platform fringing
   Laing Island in Hansa Bay, 33% more than previously documented on any
   single reef. Near Madang, 32 species occurred on four small reefs.
   Maximal density at both sites was 3/m(2), with overall density
   0.1-0.2/m(2). Species richness, diversity, and general patterns of
   microhabitat use were similar at both, but composition differed
   markedly. Only 23 species were found at both sites, and proportional
   similarity was 44%. The most common species at each site were uncommon
   at the other. The diets of 34 species were determined; 26, including the
   most abundant, preyed exclusively on polychaetes. As on other
   Indo-Pacific reefs, species partitioned prey types more finely than
   substrate types. Among vermivores, a different polychaete dominated the
   diet of each predator. Other species specialized on an enteropneust,
   other gastropods, and fishes. Most prey were herbivores or deposit
   feeders, indicating that the major trophic role of Conus species in the
   reef community is as primary carnivores. The results suggest that
   species are not more specialized than where fewer-congeners co-occur,
   but rather overlap somewhat more in resource use.

AB Small island developing states (SIDS) are recognized as a special case
   for sustainable development due to the unique set of challenges and
   vulnerabilities they face. While SIDS are a diverse group of nations,
   most share characteristics of small size, limited land availability,
   insularity, susceptibility to natural disasters and deep integration
   into global markets that make them particularly vulnerable to global
   environmental and economic change processes. Although there has been
   considerable research into the impacts of global change processes on
   small island vulnerability, much less attention has been paid to their
   resilience, particularly at the intersection of environmental and
   economic change and the consequences for food security. This paper
   presents an overview of the social-ecological vulnerabilities that drive
   food and nutrition insecurity in different SIDS contexts and considers
   how policies and governance arrangements might better support more
   resilient and sustainable small island food systems drawing from the
   collection of papers in this Special Issue.

AB The hypothesis that small body size is correlated with preference for
   young leaves was tested in a community of leaf-chewing insect herbivores
   feeding on Ficus wassa in a humid tropical forest in Papua New Guinea.
   Feeding experiments on 48 species of herbivorous insects revealed a
   negative correlation between body size and a preference for feeding on
   young leaves. While small species preferred young leaves, large species
   showed no preferences, or preferred young leaves only slightly. This
   relationship was found for the entire leaf-chewing community, as well as
   for many of the constituent taxa on several taxonomic levels, from
   orders to genera. Taxonomic position of a species played little role in
   determining its preferences. It is proposed that higher toughness and
   lower nutrient content may act as complementary defences, which prevent
   small insects from feeding on mature foliage. While the low nutrient
   content of mature leaves may affect smaller herbivores due to their
   relatively higher metabolic rate and lower digestion efficiency, their
   toughness complicates feeding mechanically and may prevent the
   compensatory feeding necessary to offset the low nutritive value of
   mature leaves.

AB Climate governance in Small Island developing States (SIDS) is a
   pressing priority to preserve livelihoods, biodiversity and ecosystems
   for the next generations. Understanding the dynamics of climate change
   policy integration is becoming more crucial as we try to measure the
   success of environmental governance efforts and chart new goals for
   sustainable development. At the international level, climate change
   policy has evolved from single issue to integrated approaches towards
   achieving sustainable development. New actors, new mechanisms and
   institutions of governance with greater fragmentation in governance
   across sectors and levels (Biermann and Pattberg, 2008) make integration
   of policy in the area of climate change governance even more of a
   challenge today. What is the Caribbean reality regarding policy
   coherence in climate change governance? Are the same climate change
   policy coherence frameworks useful. or indeed applicable for
   environmental governance in developing states more generally and for
   SIDS in particular? What are the best triggers to achieve successful
   climate change policy integration in environmental governance especially
   as the complex interconnectivity of new actors, institutions and
   mechanisms make the process of integration even more challenging? What
   facilitates and what hampers climate policy integration in the regional
   Caribbean context? This article reviews the debates around policy
   coherence for climate change governance, creates a framework to test or
   measure policy coherence and examines how relevant this has been to
   regional climate change governance processes in Commonwealth Caribbean
   States. The study found that though at the regional level, there is
   substantial recognition of the importance of and mechanics involved in
   climate policy coherence, this has not translated to policy coherence at
   the regional and national levels. There is a large degree of
   fragmentation in the application of climate policy in each Caribbean
   Island with no mechanism to breach the gap. Silos in public
   environmental governance architectures, unwillingness to share data,
   insufficient political will; unsustainable project-based funding and
   lack of accountability among actors are the main challenges to climate
   policy coherence. The findings fill a gap in the literature on the
   elements of climate policy coherence from a SIDS perspective. (C) 2015

AB The greenhouse frog, Eleutherodactylus planirostris, is a
   direct-developing (i.e., no aquatic stage) frog native to Cuba and the
   Bahamas. It was introduced to Hawai'i via nursery plants in the early
   1990s and then subsequently from Hawai'i to Guam in 2003. The greenhouse
   frog is now widespread on five Hawaiian Islands and Guam. Infestations
   are often overlooked due to the frog's quiet calls, small size, and
   cryptic behavior, and this likely contributes to its spread. Because the
   greenhouse frog is an insectivore, introductions may reduce
   invertebrates. In Hawai'i, the greenhouse frog primarily consumes ants,
   mites, and springtails and obtains densities of up to 12,500 frogs
   ha(-1). At this density, it is estimated that they can consume up to
   129,000 invertebrates ha(-1) night(-1). They are a food source for the
   nonnative brown tree snake in Guam and may be a food source for other
   nonnative species. They may also compete with other insectivores for
   available prey. The greatest direct economic impacts of the invasions
   are to the nursery trade, which must treat infested shipments. Although
   various control methods have been developed to control frogs in Hawai'i,
   and citric acid, in particular, is effective in reducing greenhouse
   frogs, the frog's inconspicuous nature often prevents populations from
   being identified and managed.

   of the eastern Caribbean Sea. The plume's areal extent fluctuates
   through the year, being at its greatest during the northern South
   American, July-December rainy season. The area perennially-impacted by
   the plume is thus surrounded by a rim that is only seasonally-impacted.
   The plume is transported NW across the Caribbean Sea by the Caribbean
   Current.
   Two upper bathyal piston cores were used in this study. Core BGT-031
   (water depth 260 m) was taken from the perennially-impacted area east of
   Trinidad, while JPC-ASC-001 (water depth 428 m) was collected from the
   seasonally-impacted area northwest of Tobago. Both cores are similar to
   80 cm long. They were sampled at 10 cm intervals, four replicates being
   collected from each of nine horizons. Qualitative comparisons are made
   with a previously-reported core (BGT-086) collected from the
   seasonally-impacted area east of Trinidad.
   Distinct differences in foraminifers] assemblages were found between
   JPC-ASC-00 l and BGT-036. These differences are ascribed to the cores'
   differing relationships with the Orinoco Plume. The assemblage in the
   perennially-impacted Core BGT-031 was dominated by Uvigerina parvula
   with subdominant Cibicidoides umbonatus and Cihicides pachyderma. That
   in the seasonally-impacted JPC-ASC-00 l was dominated by Sphaeroidina
   bulloides, with (in rank order) subdominant Globocassidulina subglobosa
   subcalifornica, C. umbonatus and C. pachyderma. ANOVA indicated that U
   parvula and S. bulloides are both specialist species with relatively
   narrow niches, the mean proportional abundances differing between
   horizons in their respective cores. Cibicidoides umbonatus is in
   contrast shown to be a generalist species. The mean Shannon's index H
   for replicates from JPC-ASC-001 was significantly greater than that for
   replicates from BGT-031, but qualitatively comparable to that for
   BGT-086. Meanwhile, mean dominance, measured using max(m), was
   significantly lower in JPC-ASC-001 than in BGT-031, that in the former
   being comparable to that in BGT-086. Epistominella exigua, which is
   indicative of a seasonal phytodetrital flux, was recovered from BGT-086,
   but not from JPC-ASC-00 , even though both cores were recovered from the
   seasonally-impacted rim. This difference is ascribed to the development
   of a wake and an eddy in the Caribbean Current to the lee of Tobago that
   locally change the nature of surface productivity.

AB This article examines how the energy needs of small island states may be
   met using renewable energy systems which have been applied in the island
   and coastal states of the Caribbean area. It describes success stories
   such as the 23,000 solar water heaters installed on homes in Barbados
   and proposes ways of extending these to other areas of the economy where
   renewable energy has yet to make an impact. Solar crop dryers are used
   widely and windmills which were used to grind sugarcane for 300 years in
   some of the islands are now being revived for electricity generation and
   water pumping. In the hot and humid Caribbean, the major fraction of our
   electricity consumption is for refrigeration and air conditioning but
   solar cooling is rare. Solar thermally powered absorption cycles are
   inefficient, but it should be possible to operate hybrid systems where
   biomass fuel is used to supplement the heat from the solar collectors.
   This area will require a technological breakthrough before it becomes
   economic. In the meantime, photovoltaic (PV) systems are becoming
   cheaper and PV-powered vapour compression coolers may be the preferred
   technology of the immediate future. PV systems are used for other
   purposes, one is currently used to operate a 75.7 m(3) (20,000 US
   gallon) per day reverse osmosis desalination plant on the island of St
   Croix. In isolated islands, it is necessary to consider the full
   environmental cost of any technology since normal economic analyses
   often ignore these when they recommend fossil fuelled systems. (C) 1997

   southwest Pacific Oceans, between 140 and 4400 m. Twenty- five new
   species are described, and the diagnoses and illustrations of some
   relatively rare species (M. africana, M. debilis, M. lenzii, M.
   moresbyi, M. orcina, M. sinclairi, M. stylirostris and M. wardeni) are
   provided. The reestablishment of the genus Galacantha is proposed,
   including the descriptions/ diagnoses and a key to all species. The
   genus contains nine species, including three new species (G. bellis, G.
   diomedeae, G. quiquei n. sp., G. rostrata, G. spinosa, G. subrostrata n.
   sp., G. subspinosa n. sp., G. trachynotus and G. valdiviae). The number
   of species collected by station is very small (usually one species),
   probably related to their low densities. However, in some samples, as
   many as five species have been found. The highest number of species have
   been observed in the Banda Sea (Indonesia) and Solomon Islands. The new
   records of some species greatly extend the previously known distribution
   range of the species.

AB Renewable technologies have been advocated in Small Island Developing
   States (SIDS) as a risk mitigation measure against oil price volatility.
   This paper applies empirical data in a custom-built stochastic
   simulation model in order to assess the economic impacts of renewable
   technology investments in Fiji's electricity grid. The model extends
   previous applications of portfolio theory to the electricity sector by
   incorporating variability of output from different technologies. The
   results demonstrate that investments in low-cost, low-risk renewable
   technologies, such as geothermal, energy efficiency, biomass and bagasse
   technologies, can be expected to lower both generation costs and
   financial risk for the electricity grid in Fiji. These results are
   driven by the reduction in oil-fired generation that these investments
   entail. The benefits of hydropower and several other "intermittent"
   renewable technologies are more limited in the model, given that they
   require costly investment in backup oil based generating capacity. (C)

AB Pliocene delta O-18 records of shallow and deep dwelling planktonic
   foraminifers from the Caribbean (Ocean Drilling Program sites 999 and
   1000), the tropical east Pacific (sites 1241 and 851), and the Atlantic
   (site 925, Ceara Rise, and site 1006, western Great Bahama Bank) were
   used to examine Atlantic-Caribbean-Pacific atmospheric and oceanic
   linkages associated with the progressive closure of the Central American
   Seaway (5.5-3 Ma). Comparisons indicate the development of an
   inner-Caribbean salinity gradient in the mixed layer and salinity
   changes on precessional periodicities after 4.4 Ma (site 1000), when the
   Pacific-Caribbean throughflow became significantly restricted. The
   high-amplitude variability in salinity is also observed at site 1006,
   monitoring the Caribbean outflow into the Atlantic. Comparisons of
   Caribbean and Atlantic planktonic delta O-18 records suggest the North
   Atlantic subtropical gyre as a major source for high-salinity surface
   waters. Precession-induced variations in the volume transport of Pacific
   surface water masses through the Panamanian Seaway are considered a main
   factor to explain the Caribbean salinity minima. Results from a coupled
   climate model point to changes in the El Nino-Southern Oscillation state
   as a potential trigger for changes in the amount of Pacific inflow into
   the Caribbean.

AB Aim: Island tropical montane cloud forests (TMCFs) host a
   disproportionally high share of the global biodiversity and provide
   critical ecosystem services to vulnerable insular societies. However,
   this ecosystem is imperilled by anthropogenic impacts including climate
   change that might push TMCFs towards higher elevations. The elevation at
   which TMCFs start varies greatly among islands and may depend on
   topographically driven local climate, which may in turn be influenced by
   large-scale climate. Thus, a necessary prerequisite to assessing the
   vulnerability of island TMCFs to climate change is to determine the role
   of island features versus regional climate in influencing local climate
   at the lower TMCF ecotone.
   Location: Tropical islands.
   Methods: An extensive literature review of the elevation at which island
   TMCFs start was undertaken. This elevation was modelled as a function of
   the altitude of the lifting condensation level (LCL) imposed by regional
   climate, island maximum elevation and upwind forest loss over the past
   15 years.
   Results: The elevation of the lower TMCF boundary was found to have been
   reported for 93 islands worldwide. TMCFs starts from as low as 300 m on
   the small islands of Kosrae (Micronesia; maximum elevation = 628 m) and
   Aneityum (Vanuatu; 852 m) to a maximum of 1,600 m on the large islands
   of Cuba (1,974 m) and Hispaniola (3,175 m), providing a spectacular
   example of the 'Massenerhebung effect'. Both regional climate (LCL
   altitude) and island features (maximum elevation) influenced the
   elevation of the lower TMCF boundary, and these variables together
   accounted for 79% of the variance.
   Main conclusions: On islands, climate change is likely to cause
   significant but small upslope shifts of the LCL and subsequently of TMCF
   lower boundary elevation in the future (+4.4 m for each 1 degrees C
   increase in temperature). TMCF clearing and biological invasions might
   appear to be more pressing threats.

AB Living vertebrates vary drastically in body size, yet few taxa reach the
   extremely minute size of some frogs and teleost fish. Here we describe
   two new species of diminutive terrestrial frogs from the megadiverse
   hotspot island of New Guinea, one of which represents the smallest known
   vertebrate species, attaining an average body size of only 7.7 mm. Both
   new species are members of the recently described genus Paedophryne, the
   four species of which are all among the ten smallest known frog species,
   making Paedophryne the most diminutive genus of anurans. This discovery
   highlights intriguing ecological similarities among the numerous
   independent origins of diminutive anurans, suggesting that minute frogs
   are not mere oddities, but represent a previously unrecognized
   ecological guild.

AB It is known that climate impacts can have significant effects on the
   environment, societies and economies. For human populations, climate
   change impacts can be devastating, giving rise to economic disruption
   and mass migration as agricultural systems fail, either through drought
   or floods. Such events impact significantly, not only where they happen,
   but also in the neighbouring areas. Vulnerability to the impacts of
   climate change needs to be assessed, so that adaptation strategies can
   be developed and populations can be protected. In this paper, we address
   the issue of vulnerability assessment through the use of an indicator
   approach, the climate vulnerability index (CVI). We show how this can
   overcome some of the difficulties of incommensurability associated with
   the combination of different types of data, and how the approach can be
   applied at a variety of scales. Through the development of nested index
   values, more reliable and robust coverage of large areas can be
   achieved, and we provide an indication of how this could be done. While
   further work is required to improve the methodology through wider
   application and component refinement, it seems likely that this approach
   will have useful application in the assessment of climate vulnerability.
   Through its application at sub-national and community scales, the CVI
   can help to identify those human populations most at risk from climate
   change impacts, and as a result, resources can be targeted towards those
   most in need.

AB The starchy corms of taro (Colocasia esculenta) are consumed throughout
   the tropics and are essential for food security in many developing
   countries. Taro corms are increasingly processed into fries, chips,
   flours or flakes in urban areas, and varieties with attractive corm
   flesh colours are now needed. The identification of flavonoids in taro
   corms would add value to this crop. The present study developed a
   high-performance thin layer chromatography (HPTLC) protocol for the
   high-throughput screening of flavonoids in taro germplasm. Overall, 350
   different accessions were analysed including 259 varieties from Vanuatu,
   one from Vietnam, eight from Thailand, eight from the Philippines, six
   from Malaysia, two from Japan and 18 from Indonesia. Forty-eight
   breeding lines (hybrids) including 21 from Vanuatu, 21 from Samoa, four
   from Hawaii and two from Papua New Guinea were also analysed. Ten
   flavones, namely luteolin-6-C-hexoside-8-C-pentoside, schaftoside,
   luteolin-3,7-di-O-glucoside, homoorientin, isovitexin, orientin,
   luteolin-4-O-glucoside, luteolin-7-O-glucoside, vitexin and
   apigenin-7-O-glucoside, were successfully detected in the corm and are
   responsible for the attractive yellow colour of the flesh and fibres.
   Quantitatively, luteolin-6-C-hexoside-8-C-pentoside and schaftoside were
   the most important of all the detected flavonoids. However, only 18% of
   the varieties analysed presented these two compounds and 80% presented
   poor flavonoid composition. No geographical structure of the variation
   was detected and the most flavone-rich varieties originated from
   Vanuatu, Thailand, the Philippines, Malaysia and Indonesia. The
   compounds detected in the present study were significantly and
   positively correlated, suggesting that there is potential for fast
   improvement through controlled crosses, subsequent evaluation of
   full-sib progenies and cloning of elite individuals.

   Gulf of Papua is estimated to be between 60-1300 tonnes. A predictive
   model for catches of Stolophorus heterolobus and S. devisi in the
   inshore coralline waters was constructed where: C/f km2 = 0.394 - 0.64
   .times. 10-4.f. The maximum annual sustainable yield of S. heterolobus
   and S. devisi is 0.61 t/km2. Expansion of anchovy fishing is unlikely in
   the Gulf of Papua but there may be potential for sun dried stolephorid
   anchovies from the inshore coralline areas as an export product.

AB Objective: Trinidad and Tobago has experienced an epidemiological
   transition over recent decades characterised by reduced rates of
   communicable diseases but rapidly increasing rates of obesity and
   non-communicable chronic diseases. The objective of the present study
   was to investigate the changes in energy and nutrient supply that have
   taken place in Trinidad and Tobago between 1961 and 2007.
   Design: Food balance sheets for each year between 1961 and 2007 were
   downloaded from the FAOSTAT database and daily per capita supply for
   seventeen food commodity groupings was calculated. After appropriate
   coding, energy and nutrient supply were determined using dietary
   analysis software.
   Setting: FAO food balance sheets for Trinidad and Tobago from 1961 to
   2007.
   Subjects: None.
   Results: The food supply in 2007 provided an extra 1561 kJ (373
   kcal)/capita per d than it did in 1961. Energy from carbohydrate as a
   percentage of total energy fell from 62% in 1961 to 57% in 2007, whereas
   energy from fat as a percentage of total energy increased from 26% to
   over 30% and now lies at the upper end of WHO recommendations. Sugars
   increased from 20% to over 26% of total energy and are well above WHO
   recommendations. When expressed on a nutrient density basis, supplies of
   vitamin A, folate and Ca are lower than WHO recommendations.
   Conclusions: Nutritional imbalances in the Trinidadian food supply need
   to be addressed to combat the rise in nutrition-related chronic disease
   that is projected to cause increased disability and premature death in
   the country in the coming years.

AB The freshwater resources of small islands are particularly vulnerable to
   the impacts of climate change and human stressors due to their limited
   extent and adaptive capacity. A water security approach is useful for
   effective management of the water resources; however, understanding risk
   to water security is critical in order to effectively plan and adapt to
   future changes. Currently available assessment tools generally do not
   incorporate risk and are not suitable for application on small islands,
   where the hydrogeological setting has unique vulnerabilities. The aim of
   this work is to provide a framework to characterize risk to water
   security for small islands. The risk assessment was developed using
   Andros Island, the Bahamas, as a case study area. Numerical modelling
   characterizes the response of the water system to potential future
   stressors related to climate change and human development, the results
   of which are integrated into the assessment framework. Based on risk
   assessment principles, indicators are determined for susceptibility,
   hazard threat, vulnerability and loss, in order to define the risk to
   water security. The resulting indicators are presented in geospatial
   maps that rank areas of risk to water security. These maps were provided
   to local water managers and policy-makers in the Bahamas as a tool to
   identify high-risk areas for near-term action and to inform long-term
   planning. The maps have also been used as a platform to engage local
   residents and raise awareness about the impact climate change and
   land-use activities may have on water security.

AB Interbasin and intrabasin gradients play an important role as a part of
   a regional system of Caribbean climate drivers, which include the
   Atlantic warm pool (AWP) and the Caribbean low-level jet (CLLJ). When
   the Caribbean is conditioned to be wet between May and November,
   near-surface geopotentials in the Caribbean are lower than in the nearby
   eastern tropical Pacific and east tropical Atlantic. As a result, there
   is vertical ascent in the Caribbean through to the middle troposphere
   which connects to zonal circulations with both the eastern tropical
   Pacific and the eastern tropical Atlantic. The Caribbean Sea is also
   warm, and there is a moderate easterly flow regime, indicating a
   weakening of the trade winds. Deviations from this state caused by
   changes in one or both sides of the Pacific-Caribbean and
   Caribbean-Atlantic circulations (and diagnosed by changes in their
   geopotential gradients) reasonably track the transition of the Caribbean
   from wet to dry and vice versa on intraseasonal and interannual time
   scales. The study also uses changes to the gradients to offer insight
   into why the Caribbean region is projected to be drier during its
   traditional rainy season in the face of warmer surface temperatures
   under global warming. The Caribbean seemingly enters into a "July" mode,
   which persists for the duration of the boreal summer. The mode is
   characterized by higher (lower) geopotentials in the Caribbean (Pacific
   and Atlantic), a stronger CLLJ, and anomalous descent in the Caribbean
   in spite of the warmer surface temperatures.

   Tourists and residents place a demand on local marine resources,
   particularly Caribbean spiny lobster, Panulirus argus (Latreille), queen
   conch, Lobatus gigas (Linnaeus) and Nassau grouper, Epinephelus striatus
   (Bloch), and many fishery products are also sold on the global market.
   Illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing coupled with inadequate
   regulations and enforcement are the main factors contributing to the
   decline of Bahamian fisheries along with other anthropogenic impacts.
   This article reviews the status of fisheries management in The Bahamas
   using economically and ecologically important species as case studies to
   highlight conservation successes, knowledge gaps and deficiencies in
   existing management approaches. The review concludes with an examination
   of how emerging fisheries and improved conservation management
   strategies have the potential to improve economic and food security

AB Unequal patterns in research effort can result in inaccurate assessments
   of species extinction risk or ineffective management. A group of notable
   conservation concern are tropical island endemic birds, many of which
   are also forest-dependent, which increases their vulnerability to
   extinction. Yet, island bird species have received limited research
   attention compared to their continental congeners, despite this taxon
   being globally regarded as well-studied. We used the insular Caribbean,
   a globally important endemism hotspot with high rates of deforestation,
   to explore research bias of island and regional endemic forest-dependent
   birds. A review of the published literature (n=992) found no significant
   increase in the number of studies over the search period. Research
   effort was significantly higher among species with threatened status,
   long generation time, wide habitat breadth and low to intermediate
   elevational distributions. Among family groups, the Psittacidae received
   the highest research effort, while the Cuculidae were the most
   underrepresented family (30-fold higher and six-fold less than expected,
   respectively). We found geographic biases in effort, with Jamaica having
   six-fold less and Puerto Rico eight times more research than expected
   for their level of endemism. These patterns likely reflect individual
   interests and limited capacity and funding, typical of Small Island
   Developing States. With over 50% of species in this review having
   declining population trends, we recommend prioritizing research that
   emphasises conservation- and management-relevant data across
   underrepresented families and islands, by fostering greater
   collaboration between researchers, practitioners and the existing local
   amateur ornithological community.

AB We recognize two species in Neomegalotomus, N. parvus (Westwood), the
   type species; and N. rufipes (Westwood). The two species are redescribed
   from type specimens, and are keyed. We synonymize the following species
   with Neomegalotomus parvus: N. simplex (Westwood), N. latifascia (Berg),
   and N. pallescens (Stal) (all new synonymies). We synonymize N.
   jamaicensis (Westwood) with N. rufipes (new synonymy). The type
   specimens of all species hitherto placed in the genus are also
   redescribed, except those of N. debilis (Walker) and N. vicinus
   (Westwood). N. parvus occurs from Mexico through Central America into
   northern Argentina and east into Venezuela and adjacent Caribbean
   islands. N. rufipes is widespread in the Caribbean south towards
   Venezuela. The two species overlap in distribution: N. parvus is found
   on St. Vincent and Tobago, whereas N. rufipes occurs on Grenada, which
   lies between those two islands.

AB This study examined how riverine inputs, in particular sediment,
   influenced the community structure and trophic composition of reef
   fishes within Rio Bueno, north Jamaica. Due to river discharge a
   distinct gradient of riverine inputs existed across the study sites.
   Results suggested that riverine inputs (or a factor associated with
   them) had a structuring effect on fish community structure. Whilst fish
   communities at all sites were dominated by small individuals (< 20 cm),
   diversity and total biomass were reduced with increased proximity to the
   river mouth. The abundance of all fishes, but particularly small-bodied,
   juvenile and herbivorous fishes was reduced in turbid water when
   compared to clear-water sites. Results strongly suggest that fluvial
   sediment inputs may play an important role in structuring fish
   assemblages even under intense fishing pressure.

AB Community-based ecotourism (CBET) is presented as a tool for
   conservation and sustainable development by conservation practitioners
   and development agencies, but is reported to have achieved little.
   Several scholars argue that many problems stem from inadequate power
   relationships between external actors and local communities, leading to
   low community participation. This study opens a debate on governance and
   social enterprise in CBET by examining a bottom-up approach to
   community-based ecotourism based on a small-scale CBET initiative in an
   amenity-poor remote indigenous community in Papua New Guinea. This
   initiative is unique in the following aspects: it was initiated by a
   community member; external assistance was advisory only; no external
   financial assistance was given; and it has taken place in a
   non-monetised economy. Participant observation and in-depth interviews
   with local key informants were used to identify community-defined
   positive/negative impacts and community participation processes.
   Overall, there was substantial support for the project; it contributed
   to community welfare, generated economic benefit, had positive
   conservation outcomes and from the viewpoint of the community had no
   adverse cultural impacts. One of the keys for success was the
   development of a strong community agency that led to high community
   participation and individual rather than the community ownership.

AB A Red List assessment is insufficient to determine priorities for ex
   situ conservation in large genera such as Rhododendron, where there may
   be hundreds of taxa in any one Red List category. We have utilised an
   analysis of the geographic origins of 1 215 taxa of Rhododendron
   (Ericaceae) as a method to prioritise Red List taxa for ex situ
   conservation. This analysis includes descriptions of distribution and
   endemism by country of origin, analysis of the incidence of the 715 Red
   List taxa by country of origin, and determination of the extent to which
   taxa from each country of origin are in cultivation. We determined that
   of 30 countries of origin and a 'Europe' aggregate, 24 origins contain
   Red List taxa. Of those 24 origins, 17 origins and 'Europe' have greater
   than 75 % of Red List taxa 'in cultivation', as defined in this study,
   so that Target 8 of the Global Strategy for Plant Conservation has
   theoretically been met. However, for some of these origins the number of
   each taxon held 'in cultivation' is very low and genetic diversity is
   likely to be poor. The remaining six countries of origin have less than
   75 % of Red List Rhododendron taxa recorded 'in cultivation' (Indonesia
   (28 %), Papua New Guinea (29 %), Malaysia (59 %), China (60 %), Japan
   (62 %) and Solomon Islands (0 %)). Analysis of a set of Red List factors
   and 'not in cultivation' factors reveals that Red List taxa from
   Indonesia, China and Papua New Guinea should take priority for ex situ
   conservation.

AB Compared with "high" islands, atolls and table reefs have received
   little attention from archaeologists focusing on historical ecology in
   Oceania. Limited archaeological investigations in the three
   archipelagoes composing the Republic of Kiribati (Gilbert, Phoenix, and
   Line Groups) reflect primarily culture historical reconstructions. Given
   the unique environmental challenges posed by coral islands, their
   potential for prehistoric ecological research should be recognized. By
   contrast, the last 50 years have witnessed a host of environmental
   studies, from agricultural improvements to sea-level rise and
   contemporary human impact oil terrestrial and marine resources. In an
   attempt to better understand the influence of natural and human-induced
   processes in the more distant past, this paper explores several themes
   of relevance to coral islands in general. These include (1) natural and
   anthropogenic change oil geomorphology and ecosystems, (2) anthropogenic
   Impacts on faunal resources, (3) environmental evidence for human
   colonization, (4) interisland exchange networks and population mobility,
   and (5) social evolution.

AB This study tests the predictions of Huston's dynamic equilibrium model
   of species richness. It examines field data showing the effects of
   silicates/disturbance and productivity on the number of coexisting
   species within a functional type (diatoms) in a community. Using
   multivariate statistical techniques, the pattern of phytoplankton
   species richness throughout the Caribbean islands is modelled in
   relation to overlapping gradients of silicates/disturbance and primary
   productivity originating from the Amazon and Orinoco rivers. Data were
   obtained from 44 Caribbean, South and Central American oceanographic
   stations sampled during the Caribbean Oceanographic Resources
   Exploration (CORE) of 1990. The results of the study give support to
   Huston's dynamic equilibrium hypothesis, which predicts maximum species
   richness under conditions of intermediate productivity and disturbance.
   Fishery statistics for the region show that the diversity of harvested
   marine species of commercial importance is a mirror of the diversity of
   the phytoplankton. Some consequences of global environmental change to
   the dynamic equilibrium of the allocation of fishery resources between
   small Caribbean states are discussed.

AB Negative commodity price shocks can induce balance of payments crises in
   resource dependent economies. Governments often react by intervening
   against currency depreciation as, for example, in the case of Papua New
   Guinea in response to the commodity price shocks of 2014. We develop an
   original theoretical model to analyze the balance of payments impact of
   a commodity price shock under alternative exchange rate regimes: a
   flexible rate regime and a fixed rate regime with foreign exchange
   rationing. The balance of payments consequences are shown to depend on
   the elasticity of exports and imports with respect to the exchange rate.
   For the Papua New Guinea case, we estimate export elasticities for a
   variety of commodities (gold, silver, copper, oil, coffee, cocoa, copra,
   copra oil, palm oil, rubber, tea, logs, and marine products) as well as
   for imports. The results indicate that the Marshall-Lerner condition is
   satisfied for this resource-rich economy, implying that exchange rate
   flexibility may be practicable. We implement our calibrated model to
   conduct a counter-factual simulation and find that with a flexible
   exchange rate, foreign reserves would have been 20 percent higher three
   years after the shock than they were under the actual policy of exchange
   rate stabilization. In light of this, we argue the merits of greater
   exchange rate flexibility. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

   these dependencies together, but disrupted the wider Australasia by
   excluding New Zealand, British New Guinea, Solomon Islands and Fiji. The
   consequent national histories and historiographies sought to ignore or
   deny the regional context; but economic, political and cultural links
   persisted and evolved. This regional nexus has no name (Australasia
   having been debased), but it is very real for most of its member states
   and societies. Now Australians are reluctant to acknowledge the only

AB The stratigraphic distribution of the porcelaneous benthic foraminifer
   Biloculinella irregularis, whose tests are constructed of high-Mg
   calcite, indicates major changes in the deep bottom waters of the Gulf
   of Mexico and the Caribbean Sea during the late Quaternary. The record
   of B. irregularis in six cores from the southern Gulf of Mexico
   (960-2,735 m) and the Venezuela Basin (3,925 m) shows that the species,
   rare or absent in the Holocene, was preserved in significant numbers
   during the last glacial interval. This distribution is consistent with
   that found in previous investigations in the Venezuela and Grenada
   Basins. The occurrence of B. irregularis is associated with an increased
   abundance of the aragonitic shells of pteropods. This association
   suggests that the Gulf Basin Water and Caribbean Bottom Water were less
   corrosive during the last glacial stage than during the Holocene, and
   permitted the proliferation and/or preservation of dissolution-prone,
   metastable carbonate shells. The changes in the properties of the
   deep-bathyal and abyssal waters of the Gulf and the Caribbean at the
   Pleistocene-Holocene transition are linked with those of an intermediate
   water (Upper North Atlantic Deep Water) flowing over the
   Atlantic-Caribbean sills.

AB Stable isotopes (delta O-18 and delta C-13) were measured in successive
   chambers of the aragonitic shells of the small deep-sea squid Spirula
   spirula (Linnaeus 1758) (class Cephalopoda, subclass Coleoidea, order
   Sepioidea, family Spirulidae) to determine whether their depth
   distributions change with age. The spiral shells, ranging in diameter
   from 18 to 23 mm (30-38 chambers), were collected between 2000 and 2006
   from beaches in six widely separated locations in three oceans, the
   Atlantic (Tobago and Canary Islands), Indian (Madagascar, Maldives, and
   Perth, Australia), and Pacific Oceans (Ulladulla, Australia). The
   patterns for both isotopes were highly correlated in specimens from all
   six sites. The delta O-18 data suggest that after hatching at depths >
   1,000 m at temperatures of 4-6 degrees C, the squid migrate into
   shallower, warmer waters at 12-14 degrees C at depths of 400-600 m.
   Subsequently, the increasing delta O-18 values suggest a migration back
   into somewhat cooler, deeper habitats. The delta C-13 values also
   revealed three ontogenetic stages in all six specimens, including a
   major shift from positive to negative values, which probably corresponds
   to sexual maturation, the initiation of reproduction, and concomitant
   changes in diet. In three of the six specimens (from Tobago, Canary
   Islands, and Maldives) a fourth embryonic stage (not detected in the
   oxygen data) was accompanied by markedly less positive delta C-13 values
   in the first few chambers. These data, combined with the scanty life
   history information from previous studies of S. spirula, can be used to
   compare the habitat requirements of related extant and fossil cephalopod
   genera.

AB Seawater samples were collected from four locations in the Equatorial
   Pacific Ocean during the MR02-K06 cruise of the R/V Mirai and analyzed
   for dissolved rare earth elements (REEs) using inductively coupled
   plasma mass spectrometry. According to variations of REE concentrations
   and Yb/La ratios, the results show that the river input of the Papua New
   Guinea islands may affect the compositions of REEs in the Equatorial
   Pacific surface water. The Yb/La values and the REE concentrations in
   the waters deeper than 3,000 m in the western South Pacific and the
   Equatorial Pacific Oceans, which represent the characteristics of
   Antarctic Bottom Water (AABW), demonstrate similar variation trend with
   depth. This result also indicates that the REEs which originated from
   the South Pacific Ocean have entered the North Pacific Ocean across the
   equator with AABW intrusion.

AB Surveys of stranded marine debris around Motupore Island, a small island
   in Bootless Bay, Papua New Guinea, revealed exceptionally high loads (up
   to 78.3 items m(-2)), with major concentrations in mangrove-dominated,
   depositional areas. The worst affected, 50-m stretch of shore was
   estimated to contain >37.000 items with a combined weight of 889 kg.
   Consistent with studies elsewhere, plastics comprised by far the
   majority of debris across all sites (89.7%). The lack of centralised
   waste collection and limited village-based resources, coupled with an
   increasing population, suggests that this issue is a long way from
   solution. High debris loads thwart attempts to rehabilitate depleted
   mangrove forests through smothering of seedlings, perpetuating run-off
   and water quality issues in the bay. Addressing marine debris is thus of
   fundamental importance for the sustainability of Bootless Bay and its
   resources, and a critical step in promoting ecosystem resilience. (c)
