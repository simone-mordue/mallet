AB The Grand Caribbean Sea has a complex geological history and its biota
   has had a similar evolutionary history; its distribution has been deeply
   transformed during the Pleistocene. Regarding biogeographic studies in
   the area marine biogeography is several steps behind the continental
   one. The need to improve both our taxonomic duties and understanding of
   the evolutionary scenario as serious needs to strengthen our
   biogeographic knowledge in the area are considered. Some current
   research methods are briefly reviewed and it is a proposal to take an
   ecclectic approach combining historical and ecological issues as well as
   dispersal and vicariant explanations. The complexity of the regional
   scenario is indicated in two figures; one shows dispersal routes and
   affinities through several geological periods and the other one is a
   zonification of the Grand Caribbean Sea that requires a quantitative
   analysis. Speciation facts in both the Eastern Tropical Pacific and
   Western Tropical Atlantic are briefly indicated and employed to promote
   a careful analysis of the supposed amphiamerican species in general, and
   on widespread polychaetes in particular.

AB Background: The range of the Asian tiger mosquito Aedes albopictus is
   expanding globally, raising the threat of emerging and re-emerging
   arbovirus transmission risks including dengue and chikungunya. Its
   detection in Papua New Guinea's (PNG) southern Fly River coastal region
   in 1988 and 1992 placed it 150 km from mainland Australia. However, it
   was not until 12 years later that it appeared on the Torres Strait
   Islands. We hypothesized that the extant PNG population expanded into
   the Torres Straits as an indirect effect of drought-proofing the
   southern Fly River coastal villages in response to El Nino-driven
   climate variability in the region (via the rollout of rainwater tanks
   and water storage containers).
   Methodology/Principal Findings: Examination of the mosquito's
   mitochondrial DNA cytochrome oxidase I (COI) sequences and 13 novel
   nuclear microsatellites revealed evidence of substantial intermixing
   between PNG's southern Fly region and Torres Strait Island populations
   essentially compromising any island eradication attempts due to
   potential of reintroduction. However, two genetically distinct
   populations were identified in this region comprising the historically
   extant PNG populations and the exotic introduced population. Both COI
   sequence data and microsatellites showed the introduced population to
   have genetic affinities to populations from Timor Leste and Jakarta in
   the Indonesian region.
   Conclusions/Significance: The Ae. albopictus invasion into the
   Australian region was not a range expansion out of PNG as suspected, but
   founded by other, genetically distinct population(s), with strong
   genetic affinities to populations sampled from the Indonesian region. We
   now suspect that the introduction of Ae. albopictus into the Australian
   region was driven by widespread illegal fishing activity originating
   from the Indonesian region during this period. Human sea traffic is
   apparently shuttling this mosquito between islands in the Torres Strait
   and the southern PNG mainland and this extensive movement may well
   compromise Ae. albopictus eradication attempts in this region.

AB Despite the heavy regional rainfall and considerable discharge of many
   rivers into the Colombian Basin, there have been few detailed studies
   about the dilution of Caribbean Surface Water and the variability of
   salinity in the southwestern Caribbean. An analysis of the
   precipitation, evaporation and runoff in relation to the climate
   variability demonstrates that although the salt balance in the Colombian
   Basin overall is in equilibrium, the area south of 12 N is an important
   dilution sub-basin. In the southwest of the basin, in the region of the
   Panama-Colombia Gyre, Caribbean Sea Water is diluted by precipitation
   and runoff year round, while in the northeast, off La Guajira, its
   salinity increases from December to May by upwelling. At the interannual
   scale, continental runoff is related to El Nino Southern Oscillation,
   and precipitation and evaporation south of 12 N are related to the
   Caribbean Low Level Jet. During El Nino years the maximum salinification
   occurs in the dry season (December February) while in La Nina years the
   maximum dilution (or freshening), reaching La Guajira Coastal Zone,
   occurs in the wet season (September-November).

AB A maximum of easterly zonal wind at 925 hPa in the Caribbean region is
   called the Caribbean Low-Level Jet (CLLJ). Observations show that the
   easterly CLLJ varies semi-annually, with two maxima in the summer and
   winter and two minima in the fall and spring. Associated with the
   summertime strong CLLJ are a maximum of sea level pressure (SLP), a
   relative minimum of rainfall (the mid-summer drought), and a minimum of
   tropical cyclogenesis in July in the Caribbean Sea. It is found that
   both the meridional gradients of sea surface temperature (SST) and SLP
   show a semi-annual feature, consistent with the semi-annual variation of
   the CLLJ. The CLLJ anomalies vary with the Caribbean SLP anomalies that
   are connected to the variation of the North Atlantic Subtropical High
   (NASH). In association with the cold (warm) Caribbean SST anomalies, the
   atmosphere shows the high (low) SLP anomalies near the Caribbean region
   that are consistent with the anomalously strong (weak) easterly CLLJ.
   The CLLJ is also remotely related to the SST anomalies in the Pacific
   and Atlantic, reflecting that these SST variations affect the NASH.
   During the winter, warm (cold) SST anomalies in the tropical Pacific
   correspond to a weak (strong) easterly CLLJ. However, this relationship
   is reversed during the summer. This is because the effects of ENSO on
   the NASH are opposite during the winter and summer. The CLLJ varies in
   phase with the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) since a strong (weak)
   NASH is associated with a strengthening (weakening) of both the CLLJ and
   the NAO. The CLLJ is positively correlated with the 925-hPa meridional
   wind anomalies from the ocean to the United States via the Gulf of
   Mexico. Thus, the CLLJ and the meridional wind carry moisture from the
   ocean to the central United States, usually resulting in an opposite (or
   dipole) rainfall pattern in the tropical North Atlantic Ocean and
   Atlantic warm pool versus the central United States.

AB This article analyses smoking prevalence and smoking behaviours in Papua
   New Guinea (PNG). Using the 2009-2010 PNG Household Income and
   Expenditure Survey, the article analyses the determinants of tobacco use
   and tobacco choices in PNG. The results show adults (18 years and above)
   in the poorest quartile are more likely to smoke. Tobacco consumption
   imposes a large financial burden to poor households. Tobacco consumption
   accounts for about 23 per cent of total household food expenditure for
   households in the poorest quartile, as compared with 15 per cent for the
   entire sample. However, most of these households consume non-processed
   tobacco. The study reveals the urgency to control tobacco consumption in
   PNG and considers some practical challenges that the country may face.

AB The cryptic nature of many elopomorph species and their occupation of
   minimally explored habitats have led to the underestimation of their
   importance as a component of regional biodiversity. Additionally, it had
   led to their exclusion from studies that seek to resolve the processes
   and life history traits important in determining the geographic
   distributions of species. Collections of the larval stage of elopomorphs
   provide one means of addressing regional diversity in this taxa.
   Plankton tows around Barbados during 4 separate years collected 68
   identifiable taxa of the leptocephalus larval form unique to
   elopomorphs. While most of these species have either been collected as
   adults in the Lesser Antilles or upcurrent in the Guyanas, there
   remained 11 species whose adults are not known from either biogeographic
   area, and 7 leptocephalus types of species not described as adults. To
   determine whether these leptocephali were likely to be the product of
   local spawning, or alternatively expatriates from the Guyanas, temporal
   patterns of length frequency distributions and abundance of each species
   were analyzed with respect to regional oceanographic conditions. High
   abundances and small leptocephali of species probably expatriated from
   the Guyanas were found to coincide with periods when North Brazil
   Current (NBC) rings were present around Barbados and locally produced
   coral reef fish larvae were flushed away from the sample area. Minimum
   size classes and high abundances of Lesser Antillean species were more
   sporadic over time. While this work does help establish the geographic
   distribution of a number of rare and less frequently encountered
   species, it also highlights the lack of knowledge about elopomorph
   distributions that justifies their exclusion from biogeographic studies
   reliant on accurate fine-scale distribution patterns. However, a
   comparison of species distributions across major biogeographic
   boundaries indicates that elopomorph species as a whole are more broadly
   distributed than perciform species, a pattern attributable to many
   unique characteristics of their leptocephalus larval stage.

AB Aim Identify the taxonomic patterns and the relative importance of
   particular families of Diptera sampled in comparative biodiversity
   surveys carried out at seven rain forest locations. We test and quantify
   the contention that different trapping methods routinely target
   different families. We identify the south-north (and upland/lowland)
   patterns and generate a set of hypotheses concerning mechanisms
   underlying these patterns.
   Location Australia and Papua New Guinea.
   Methods A total of 28,647 Diptera collected using canopy knockdown,
   yellow pan (water) traps and Malaise traps have been sorted to 56
   families following these surveys. Comparative analyses across sites from
   Lamington National Park in south-east Queensland, Australia to the Kau
   Wildlife area in Madang Province, Papua New Guinea, of the dipteran
   assemblages, and separately, of the 14 families which collectively made
   up 95.8% of the sample, are presented.
   Results Ordination by multi-dimensional scaling and analyses of
   variances showed that the three methods complemented each other in terms
   of target families and, together, sampled a large proportion of the
   expected fauna of these sites. Ordinations on a method-by-method basis
   permitted the identification of groups of sites and analyses of variance
   indicated which taxa differed significantly across these groups.
   Main conclusions Recurrent patterns and associated hypotheses about
   their generation emerge from the data. These mirror floristic
   differences and reflect the biogeographic history of the sites since the
   Miocene. Clear linkages between the lowland faunas of Papua New Guinea
   and northern Australia are evident and are reflected in the abundances
   of the Dolichopodidae, Empididae, Muscidae and Tipulidae (other
   groupings underlined the essential difference of the New Guinean fauna
   which had characteristic proportions of Cecidomyiidae, Chironomidae,
   Dolichopodidae, Phoridae and Psychodidae). A subtropical grouping of
   families was evident comprising, inter alia, Chloropidae,
   Mycetophilidae, Drosophilidae and Phoridae which was frequently linked
   with the higher elevation tropical fauna at Robson's Creek, Atherton
   Tablelands. The long isolated, high elevation, rain-forested massif at
   Eungella, central Queensland often emerged as a unique entity in the
   analyses, characterized by the high numbers of and proportions of
   Chironomidae, Psychodidae, Tipulidae and Empididae. This study supports
   the case for the wider use of Diptera in biodiversity analyses,
   complementing extensive earlier analyses which have used, predominantly,
   large coleopteran assemblages. The results indicate the potential power
   of family-level analyses at large geographical scales and contribute to
   the ongoing debate on 'taxonomic sufficiency'.

AB The freshwater fauna (crustaceans, molluscs, fish) of many tropical
   islands in the Caribbean and Pacific share an amphidromous life-cycle,
   meaning their larvae need to develop in saline conditions before
   returning to freshwater as juveniles. This community dominates the
   freshwaters of much of the tropics, but is poorly known and at risk from
   development, in particular dam construction. Amphidromy can
   theoretically lead to dispersal between different freshwater areas, even
   to distant oceanic islands, via the sea. The extent and scale of this
   presumed dispersal, however, is largely unknown in the Caribbean. Recent
   genetic work in Puerto Rico has shown that many freshwater species have
   little or no population structure among different river catchments,
   implying high levels of connectivity within an island, whereas
   between-island structure is unknown. We used genetic techniques to infer
   the geographic scales of population structure of amphidromous
   invertebrates (a gastropod and a number of crustacean species) between
   distant parts of the Caribbean, in particular Puerto Rico, Panama and
   Trinidad. We found virtually no geographic population structure across
   over 2000km of open sea for these freshwater species. This implies that
   they are indeed moving between islands in sea currents as larvae,
   meaning that continued recruitment requires a continuum of healthy
   habitat from the freshwater to marine environment. We further discuss
   the role of amphidromy and suggest its ecological and biogeographic role
   may be more important than previously presumed. Resumen La fauna de agua
   dulce (crustaceos, moluscos, peces) de algunas islas tropicales en el
   Caribe y Pacifico comparte un ciclo de vida anfidromo, lo que significa
   que deben desarrollar sus larvas en condiciones salinas antes de volver
   al agua dulce como juveniles. Esta comunidad domina las aguas dulces de
   gran parte de los tropicos, pero es poco conocida y en riesgo de no
   poder continuar completando su ciclo vital, en particular, por a la
   construccion de represas. Debido a la relacion con el mar, este proceso
   de anfidromia teoricamente puede conducir a la dispersion entre las
   distintas areas de agua dulce a traves del el oceano, lo cual parece
   probable para islas oceanicas lejanas. Sin embargo, el alcance y la
   magnitud de esta aparente dispersion son desconocidos en el Caribe.
   Estudios geneticos recientes llevados a cabo en Puerto Rico mostraron
   que muchas especies de agua dulce tienen poca o ninguna estructura
   poblacional entre diferentes cuencas fluviales, lo que implica altos
   nivele de conectividad dentro de una isla, mientras que entre islas la
   estructura es desconocida. Nosotros utilizamos tecnicas geneticas para
   inferir las escalas geograficas de la estructura poblacional de
   invertebrados anfidromos (un gasteropodo y algunas especies de
   crustaceos) entre partes distantes del Caribe, en particular, Puerto
   Rico, Panama y Trinidad. No se encontro practicamente ninguna
   estructuracion geografica en las poblaciones separadas por mas de 2000km
   de mar abierto para estas especies de agua dulce. Esto implica que en
   realidad las diferentes poblaciones de estas especies estan en
   movimiento en forma de larvas entre islas mediante las corrientes
   marinas. La persistencia de un reclutamiento continuo de estas especies
   requiere la existencia de habitat saludable que mantenga la conexion
   entre los ecosistemas de agua dulce y marinos. Tambien discutimos el
   papel de la anfidromia y sugerimos que su papel ecologico y
   biogeografico puede ser mas importante de lo que se presume.

AB Ciguatera fish poisoning (CFP) is a circumtropical disease caused by
   ingestion of a variety of reef fish that bioaccumulate algal toxins.
   Distribution and abundance of the organisms that produce these toxins,
   chiefly dinoflagellates of the genus Gambierdiscus, are reported to
   correlate positively with water temperature. Consequently, there is
   growing concern that increasing temperatures associated with climate
   change could increase the incidence of CFP. This concern prompted
   experiments on the growth rates of six Gambierdiscus species at
   temperatures between 18 degrees C and 33 degrees C and the examination
   of sea surface temperatures in the Caribbean and West Indies for areas
   that could sustain rapid Gambierdiscus growth rates year-round. The
   thermal optimum for five of six Gambierdiscus species tested was >= 29
   degrees C. Long-term SST data from the southern Gulf of Mexico indicate
   the number of days with sea surface temperatures >= 29 degrees C has
   nearly doubled (44 to 86) in the last three decades. To determine how
   the sea surface temperatures and Gambierdiscus growth data correlate
   with CFP incidences in the Caribbean, a literature review and a uniform,
   region-wide survey (1996-2006) of CFP cases were conducted. The highest
   CFP incidence rates were in the eastern Caribbean where water
   temperatures are warmest and least variable. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Aim The plant genus Bursera, with 104 species of trees and shrubs, has
   been used as a model for biogeographical analyses because of its high
   species richness and large number of endemic species. The
   biogeographical patterns of Bursera and their implications for its
   phylogenetic classification are reviewed in order that some hypotheses
   on the historical biogeography of tropical Mexico can be proposed.
   Location Bursera is found in the south-western USA, most of Mexico,
   mainly below 1700 m elevation in tropical forests, with some species in
   xeric shrublands, diversifying along the Pacific slope, Central America,
   and north-western South America. A few species occur on the Galapagos
   and Revillagigedo archipelagos, some of which are endemics, whereas in
   the Antilles species are distributed extensively, with several endemics
   in the Bahamas, Cuba, Jamaica, and Hispaniola.
   Methods Data from specimens in herbaria and the literature were used to
   construct a matrix of 104 species in 160 areas. Distributional patterns
   of the species of Bursera were inferred applying track analysis,
   parsimony analysis of endemicity (PAE), and Brooks parsimony analysis
   (BPA).
   Results Track analysis revealed four individual tracks: (1) a
   circum-Caribbean track, comprising species of the Bursera simaruba
   species group; (2) an Antillean track, including species that have been
   transferred to Commiphora based on their pollen traits; (3) a Mexican
   Pacific track, including species of the B. fragilis, B. microphylla, and
   B. fagaroides species groups, called 'cuajiotes'; and (4) a Neotropical
   Pacific track, including the two species groups assigned to section
   Bullockia, in which the individual track of the Bursera copallifera
   species group is nested within the track of the B. glabrifolia species
   group. The four tracks overlap in a node in the Mexican Pacific slope,
   where they are highly diversified. PAE allowed us to identify 22 areas
   of endemism: 12 in Mexico (11 along the Mexican Pacific slope), six in
   the Antilles, two in Central America, one in South America, and one in
   the Galapagos. The general area cladogram obtained by BPA has two main
   clades: one includes the greater Antilles; and the other, 12 Mexican
   areas of endemism.
   Main conclusions Bursera fragilis, B. microphylla, and B. fagaroides
   species groups can be treated together as a new section within Bursera,
   sect. Quaxiotea, because they are segregated from the other groups of
   sect. Bursera based on morphological, anatomical, molecular and
   geographical evidence.

AB The 2009 Samoa (M-w 8.1), 2010 Chile (8.8), and 2011 Tohoku (9.0)
   earthquakes generated destructive tsunamis recorded by a large number of
   DART stations in the Pacific Ocean. High-resolution (15s) DART records
   yield mean energy decay times for these events of 17.3, 24.7, and 24.6h,
   respectively. We attribute these differences to the frequency content of
   the tsunamis. Specifically, the Samoa tsunami was a high-frequency event
   with periods of 2-30min whereas the Chile and Tohoku tsunamis were
   broad-band events with periods of 2-180min. Differences in frequency
   content are linked to differences in the source parameters: Samoa was a
   relatively small deep-water earthquake while Chile and Tohoku were
   extensive shallow-water earthquakes. Frequency-dependent analysis of the
   Chile and Tohoku tsunamis indicates that shorter period waves attenuate
   much faster than longer-period waves (decay times range from 15h for
   2-6min waves to 29h for 60-180min waves).

AB The irregular echinoid Clypeaster Lamarck is locally common in Oligocene
   to Quaternary sedimentary deposits in the Caribbean region, particularly
   in marine limestones of shallow-water origin. Clypeaster lamprus H.L.
   Clark is the first member of this genus identified from the deeper water
   shelf limestones of the early Pleistocene Manchioneal Formation of
   Jamaica. Although still extant in the tropical western Atlantic and
   Caribbean, this species is unknown from the Recent of Jamaica. Extant C.
   lamprus is a deeper water species (78-450 m), with a depth range
   comparable with that otherwise estimated for the Manchioneal Formation.
   This genus is common in the Oligo-Miocene shelf limestones of the White
   Limestone Group, but is rarer in the overlying carbonate and
   siliciclastic facies of the Coastal Group (Upper Miocene to
   Pleistocene). A preliminary Clypeaster biostratigraphy is presented for
   Jamaica.

   Cozumel (Mexico), including Il new records from Belize and five new
   records from Cozumel. Tubastraea coccinea in Belize and Cozumel, and the
   hydrocoral Millepora striata in Belize represent biogeographic range
   extensions. A total of 94% of the species of zooxanthellate Scleractinia
   were found at both locations, but only 58% of the species of
   azooxanthellate Scleractinia were found at both locations. About 94% of
   the zooxanthellate Scleractinian species known from the Caribbean have
   been found at Belize and 91% found at Cozumel, and 25% and 43% of the
   known shallow-water (0-30 m) azooxanthellate Scleractinia have been
   found at the two sites, respectively, suggesting that the zooxanthellate
   Scleractinia may be better sampled than the azooxanthellate
   Scleractinia. Several zooxanthellates differed notably in abundance
   between the two sites, and some species showed greater within-species
   morphological variation at Belize than Cozumel. The appearance and
   ecology of M. striata and the field identification of four plate-forming
   Agaricia species are included.

AB Phenolics in marine brown algae have been thought to follow a
   latitudinal gradient with high phenolic species in high latitudes and
   low phenolic species in low latitudes. However, tropical brown algae
   from the western Caribbean have been shown to be high in phlorotannin
   concentration, indicating that latitude alone is not a reasonable
   predictor of marine plant phenolic concentrations. This study shows that
   the range of high phenolic phaeophytes is not limited to the western
   Caribbean but encompasses the western tropical Atlantic, including
   Bermuda and the Caribbean, where algal phlorotannin concentrations can
   be as high as 25% dry weight (DW). Assimilation efficiencies (AEs) of
   phenolic-rich and phenolic-poor plants were examined in three tropical
   marine herbivores (the parrotfish, Sparisoma radians, and the brachyuran
   crab, Mithrax sculptus, from Belize and the parrotfish, Sparisoma
   chrysopterum, from Bermuda). AEs of phenolic-rich food by each of the
   three herbivore species were uniformly high, suggesting that high plant
   phenolic concentrations did not affect AEs in these species. This is in
   contrast to some temperate marine herbivores where phenolic
   concentrations of 10% DW have been shown to drastically reduce AE. The
   apparent contradiction is discussed in light of the effects of specific
   herbivore gut characteristics on successful herbivory of high phenolic
   brown algae.

   acutifrons in waters surrounding Jamaica, West Indies. Individual

   displayed remarkable constancy in their clutch durations (= egg or
   embryonic development time). All species exhibited clutch durations of
   20-23 h and cycle durations (= sum of clutch and inter-clutch durations)
   of 24 h, except for the offshore species O.plumifera where the clutch
   duration was 36 h and the cycle duration 48 or 72 h. Egg laying appeared
   to be synchronized by photoperiod, occurring around dawn for most
   species. In order to avoid biases, diel periodicity must be accounted
   for in estimates of egg production rates, and future efforts should
   concentrate on the responses of clutch size and interclutch durations to
   natural food climates.

AB The Caribbean has experienced long-term declines in coral reef habitat.
   Research on the effect of habitat degradation has emphasized the
   importance of time since disturbance on reef fish response. We examined
   whether reef fish community structure was retained over a 50-yr period
   off the coast of New Providence Island, The Bahamas, in areas with
   increased dead coral and algal cover. Using baseline data from 1955 to
   1973, we resurveyed four localities in 2006 using comparable methodology
   to assess historical and current reef fish community structure. We did
   not find evidence for changes in diversity through time; however, our
   results were suggestive of several patterns that should be further
   explored. Analysis of similarity (ANOSIM) showed that both shallow and
   deep sites have experienced change through time. A general pattern of
   relative increase was seen in the herbivore trophic group, as well as
   the squirrelfishes, parrotfishes, and, qualitatively, the wrasses, which
   may be explained by an increase in algal cover and/or a decrease in
   predation pressure. Planktivores, primarily cardinalfishes, showed a
   trend towards decreased relative abundance. Overall, the results were
   consistent with a hypothesis that reef fish assemblages around New
   Providence Island are responding to the effects of relatively recent (<
   10 yrs) coral loss. Distinct differences were also found between depths
   above and below 6 m, irrespective of time or site. These areas should be
   continually monitored to track long-term effects, particularly given the
   proliferation of the invasive lionfish, Pterois volitans (Linnaeus,
   1758), subsequent to the time frame examined in this study.

AB The work of herding pigs falls mainly to women in the New Guinea
   Highlands. Yet men control the disposal of animals, commonly in
   sociopolitical exchange events that earn them prestige. Some
   commentators regard these pig management arrangements as an aspect of
   exploitative gender relations, men appropriating the labor of women to
   bolster their reputations. But this interpretation is contrary to the
   constitution of an acephalous social order, which esteems equality and
   affords both women and men political freedom. An investigation of pig
   ownership and production challenges the exploitation hypothesis. Both
   women and men have rights in animals which all recognize. And the labor
   and energy put into pig herding do not suggest exploitation. Indeed,
   labor arrangements and expenditure cast production in an intriguing
   light. In some critical senses they obfuscate its existence, not to hide
   exploitation from the hapless exploited but to nullify the possibility
   as pertinent to an acephalous polity. The production of gifts in this
   tribal context is radically different from the production of commodities
   for a market where notions of exploitation may apply. (Papua New Guinea,
   pigs, gender, labor, property).

AB The New World genus Cathorops in the family Ariidae (Sea Catfishes)
   includes species that inhabit estuarine and coastal waters as well as
   freshwaters, playing an important role in Neotropical coastal and
   estuarine fisheries. The relatively conserved external morphology
   coupled with the marked sexual dimorphism and ontogenetic variation
   makes it difficult to recognize and diagnose the species. One of the
   major problems concerns the nomenclatural and geographical limits, of C.
   spixii, described from tropical Brazil and often treated as the only
   coastal marine species in the genus from the Western Atlantic.
   Examination of types of nominal species as well as comprehensive
   collections of non-types from Caribbean and Atlantic South America, lead
   us to conclude that C. spixii is restricted to Brazil and that C.
   nuchalis is a valid species, ranging from Venezuela to Guyana. The
   nominal species Arius laticeps, Arius nigricans, and Arius variolosus
   are synonyms of C. nuchalis, C. spixii, and C. arenatus, respectively.
   We also describe a new species in the Cathorops mapale species group
   from Colombia and Venezuela.

AB Locally relevant scenarios of daily weather variables that represent the
   best knowledge of the present climate and projections of future climate
   change are needed by planners and managers to inform management and
   adaptation to climate change decisions. Information of this kind for the
   future is only readily available for a few developed country regions of
   the world. For many less-developed regions, it is often difficult to
   find series of observed daily weather data to assist in planning
   decisions. This study applies a previously developed single-site weather
   generator (WG) to the Caribbean, using examples from Belize in the west
   to Barbados in the east. The purpose of this development is to provide
   users in the region with generated sequences of possible future daily
   weather that they can use in a number of impact sectors. The WG is first
   calibrated for a number of sites across the region and the goodness of
   fit of the WG against the daily station observations assessed.
   Particular attention is focussed on the ability of the precipitation
   component of the WG to generate realistic extreme values for the
   calibration or control period. The WG is then modified using change
   factors (CFs) derived from regional climate model projections (control
   and future) to simulate future 30-year scenarios centred on the 2020s,
   2050s and 2080s. Changes between the control period and the three
   futures are illustrated not just by changes in average temperatures and
   precipitation amounts but also by a number of well-used measures of
   extremes (very warm days/nights, the heaviest 5-day precipitation total
   in a month, counts of the number of precipitation events above specific
   thresholds and the number of consecutive dry days).

   reports. In a few families. available material was re-examined and
   appropriate changes in species identifications were made. Only three
   species. (Glycera axycephala Ehlers, 1887; Hemipodia pustulata
   (Friedrich 1956); and Scolepis (Scolepis) squamata (Muller. 1806)) have
   been reported from the Caribbean coast of Costa Rica, and these three
   species have also been reported from the Pacific Coast. The families
   with more than 15 species are the Spionidae (26), Cirratulidae (24),
   Nereididae (21), Lumbrineridae (19) and Paraonidae (16). Despite
   extensive sampling on the Pacific coast over the last 25 years.. the
   Costa Rican polychaete fauna, especially that of the Caribbean coast,
   remains poorly known.

AB The territorial waters of Australia and Papua New Guinea (PNG) are
   similar in that they contain extensive, biodiverse coral reef systems
   that remain in relatively good condition, despite some recent setbacks.
   However there are stark contrasts in the socio-economic environments of
   the two countries; Australia is a modern developed economy with a high
   level of affluence, while PNG is still in transition from a basic
   subsistence economy. The different socio-economic circumstances have
   lead to a marked difference between the two countries in the way reef
   resources are used, and consequently, how they are managed. Approaches
   to reef management have continued to diverge during the past decade.
   Australia is setting an example to the rest of the world for the
   conservation of coral reefs through a system of central planning,
   legislation and enforcement. Conversely in PNG, there is minimal central
   management, although there is recognition by government of the
   importance of state controls and legislation. An alternative model is
   developing in PNG for a decentralised, community-based system for reef
   resource management driven largely by NGOs, because there are limited
   resources for national control. Results from established or planned
   monitoring programs will determine the effectiveness of these differing
   approaches in the long-term.

   Petkovski, 1986 from Mozambique and N. (P.) herbsti Petkovski, 1986 from

   Pediger 1 in Neocyclops is distinct although reduced and often concealed
   beneath the cephalic shield. Specimens of Neocyclops (N.) vicinus and N.
   (N.) medius showed the same condition, warranting the supposition that
   the free pediger 1 is a consistent feature of the genus. The genital
   double somite bears a transverse cuticular thickening which apparently
   supports the seminal receptacle. The importance of the integumental pore
   patterns of the urosome and legs as useful taxonomic characters is
   pointed out.

AB Twenty-eight isolates of Pythium insidiosum and P destruens from Asia,
   Australia and the Americas were compared on the basis of restriction
   fragment-length polymorphisms of the amplified ribosomal intergenic
   spacer. Comparison of band profiles yielded three distinct clusters and
   an isolate that did not fall into any of the clusters. Cluster I
   consisted of 16 isolates, all from the Americas (Costa Rica, Brazil,
   Haiti, United States). Cluster 11 consisted of seven isolates from Asia
   (India, Thailand, Japan, Papua New Guinea) and Australia, including the
   two isolates of P destruens. This cluster also included a United States
   isolate from a human who might have contracted an infection of P
   insidiosum by contact with food from the Middle East. Cluster III was
   most distantly related to the other two clusters and consisted of two
   isolates from Thailand and one from the United States. The isolate
   excluded from all three clusters was from a spectacled bear in a zoo in
   the United States. These results indicate that all the isolates are more
   closely related to each other than to any other Pythium species and thus
   indeed might be one species, but they also point to geographical
   variants. Cluster III and Isolate M18 are so distant from the others
   that they might prove to be separate species. Knowledge of intraspecific
   variability in P insidiosum, might be important for the management of
   pythiosis in mammals.

AB Chlorophyll and carotenoid pigments were measured at stations in the
   Bismarck Sea north of Papua New Guinea and along the equator between 143
   degrees E and 152 degrees E as part of the Tropical River Ocean
   Processes In Coastal Settings (TROPICS) programme in August 1997 and
   January/February 2000. Algal class abundances were estimated from these
   pigments using the CHEMTAX programme. The algal classes likely to be
   present (based on microscopy, HPLC chromatograms, literature and
   unpublished data from the region) and estimated by CHEMTAX were diatoms,
   cryptophytes, chlorophytes, haptophytes, chrysophytes, Synechocoecus and
   Prochlorococcus. The first period corresponded to the SE tradewind
   season, when there was a drought in Papua New Guinea and the discharge
   from the Sepik River was unusually low. Samples were collected on four
   N-S transects (approximately 150 km in length): one to the east of the
   Sepik River, one from the mouth of the Sepik River and two to the west
   of the Sepik River. Stations in the central Bismarck Sea and along the
   equator were characterised by a deep chlorophyll maximum (DCM), and
   haptophytes and Prochlorococcus were the major algal classes. Stations
   affected by the Sepik River plume were characterised by a more
   homogeneous distribution of chlorophyll with chlorophytes making a
   significant contribution, particularly at shallower depths.
   Synechococcus and chrysophytes were moderately abundant, while
   cryptophytes and diatoms were of minor importance. The second cruise
   occurred during the NW monsoon under conditions of high river flow, and
   samples were collected along a transect from the mouth of the Sepik
   River to Manus Island and in the central Bismarck Sea. Chlorophyll
   concentrations were higher than in 1997, particularly in near surface
   waters, while a DCM was generally not observed at any station in the
   Bismarck Sea-even at stations upstream (and upwind) and far removed from
   the mouth of the Sepik River. Prochlorococcus made a smaller, and
   chlorophytes a larger, contribution to chlorophyll than in 1997. Unlike
   the situation in 1997, there were large station to station variations in
   the vertical profiles of chlorophyll and algal class distributions which
   cannot be attributed directly to the plume from the Sepik River. Pigment
   ratios, fitted by the CHEMTAX programme, were generally in good
   agreement with literature values. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

   (Euphorbiaceae), Plumeria acutifolia Poir. (Apocynaceae), Spathodea
   campanulata Beauv. (Bignoniaceae) and Ficus sp. (Moraceae). Other
   previously recorded larval hosts in Papua New Guinea include Araucaria
   cunninghamii Ait. ex D. Don (Araucariaceae), Anisoptera polyandra Bl. [=
   A. thurifera (Bl.) Bl.] (Dipterocarpaceae) and Pinus patula Schlecht. &
   Cham. (Pinaceae). These data indicate that D. tincturatus is polyphagous
   and has adapted to feed on the wood of a wide variety of tree species
   from non-related families. Some of the above-mentioned plant hosts, e.g.
   Plumeria acutifolia, Hevea brasiliensis and Spathodea campanulata, are
   introduced plants to Papua New Guinea. In the Passam area, East Sepik
   Province, adults are nocturnal but in other areas of Papua New Guinea
   they may be diurnally active on leaves and fallen logs. The larvae
   appear to prefer the smaller diameter branches/stems of the host plants.
   All of the known host plants have either resin or latex in the wood/bark
   which are attractive to the adults and are probably the main
   energy/nutrient sources for the developing larvae.

AB The high financial costs and institutional constraints of adapting to
   climate change necessitate joint planning with other development and
   environmental priorities, especially in Small Island Developing States.
   In response, ecosystem-based adaptation (EbA) is gaining recognition as
   a cost-effective and synergistic approach for enhancing livelihoods
   through nature's services, building community resilience, and
   integrating marine spatial planning. Using Seychelles in the West Indian
   Ocean as a case study, we assess the readiness for climate change as a
   tool to implement and mainstream EbA across various spatial scales. Our
   assessment highlights certain governance mechanisms and policy processes
   that could contribute to joint adaptation and economic planning and in
   achieving multiple objectives. These include leadership, institutional
   mechanisms, science-policy nexus, decision-making structures,
   stakeholder involvement, and technological innovation. These readiness
   factors as well as knowledge gaps on future risks provide lessons for
   other SIDS in their climate change and integrated coastal management
   initiatives. As such, the needs to strengthen local governing capacity,
   secure sustainable funding, and promote adaptation research for
   long-term monitoring and cross-scale linkages are warranted.

AB Sediment cores were collected from coastal ponds across San Salvador
   Island, an isolated Bahamian carbonate platform, and integrated with
   aerial photographs and field-survey data to provide insight into how
   spatially variable storm records are at the island scale and what drives
   this-variance. A better understanding of local tempestite generation and
   preservation potential is crucial for correlating events across more
   regional scales. Sandy storm layers, products of beach overwash and/or
   high-energy aeolian transport from the shore into coastal ponds, are
   easily distinguished from flocculated carbonate muds, microbial mats,
   and other organics that ordinarily sequester in the stagnant, low-energy
   coastal water bodies. Interpreted paleotempestites do not correlate well
   between studied ponds using a strictly stratigraphic approach, although
   all sites investigated are situated within 150 m of a sandy beach, are
   similar in size and morphology, and coastal terrains across the small
   island are comparable. While wrack lines show that individual storms
   produce surges that vary in height along the island's 60 km-long
   coastline, differences in the spatial distribution of storm deposits
   cannot be explained solely as a function of variable surge heights,
   storm trajectories, and shore aspect; they also reflect intrinsic,
   biogeomorphic variables such as pond-fringing vegetation characteristics
   and coastal geomorphic configuration. A complete storm chronology for
   the island is not generated in any single pond location, and diagenetic
   processes compound this variance, producing a high degree of spatial
   heterogeneity of storm records. Nonetheless, the Caribbean-wide
   Hurricane Hyperactivity Period is distinguished in core from the modern
   period of relative inactivity by an up-core transition from sandy,
   stratified pond deposits containing storm layers to heavily bioturbated
   sediments indicative of low-E deposition. This facies transition,
   recognized across the island, provides a regional correlation tool for
   evaluating the distribution of paleotempestites within context of major
   climate regimes.

AB Iron (Fe) deposition from African dust has been implicated in a variety
   of environmental impacts on downwind terrestrial and marine ecosystems
   throughout the Caribbean. The most abundant form of Fe in African dust
   is Fe-III, which is often not bioavailable. The objective of this study
   was to determine to what degree microorganisms isolated from African
   dust collected in Trinidad and Tobago are capable of producing
   siderophores that mobilize bioavailable Fe into the environment. Aerosol
   samples were collected for microbial analyses during African dust
   conditions in the source region (Mali) and downwind sites (Trinidad and
   Tobago). Microbial community fingerprints, obtained by means of terminal
   restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis, were compared among
   aerosol samples and possible Trinidadian sources of locally aerosolized
   microorganisms (sea water and soils). Ordination of the fingerprint data
   revealed similarities between aerosols from the source region and the
   aerosols and soils of downwind regions. Aerosol isolates from the
   downwind sites were screened for siderophore production using a modified
   chrome azurol-S (CAS) assay. Twenty-five percent of isolates tested that
   were sampled under non-dust conditions and 65% of African dust isolates
   produced at least one type of siderophore; among African dust isolates,
   all known classes of siderophores were produced. These data support
   African dust microorganism siderophore production as a viable mechanism
   by which Fe bioavailability may be increased in downwind locations,
   given appropriate conditions for microbial proliferation.

   Caribbean Sea (CS) and the Gulf of Mexico (GOM) the composition of the
   salpid fauna is still poorly known and this group remains among the less
   studied zooplankton taxa in the Northwestern Tropical Atlantic. A
   revised checklist of the salp species recorded in the North Atlantic
   (NA, 0-40 degrees N) is provided herein, including new information from
   the Western Caribbean. Zooplankton samples were collected during two
   cruises (March 2006, January 2007) within a depth range of 0-941 m. A
   total of 14 species were recorded in our samples, including new records
   for the CS and GOM area (Cyclosalpa bakeri Ritter 1905), for the CS
   (Cyclosalpa affinis (Chamisso, 1819)), and for the Western Caribbean
   (Salpa maxima Forskal, 1774). The number of species of salps known from
   the CS and GOM rose to 18. A key for the identification of the species
   recorded in the region is provided. Studies on the ecological role of
   salps in several sectors of the NA are scarce and deserve further
   attention.

AB Ciguatera fish poisoning is a seafood-borne illness caused by
   consumption of fish that have accumulated lipid-soluble ciguatoxins. In
   the United States, ciguatera is responsible for the highest reported
   incidence of food-borne illness outbreaks attributed to finfish, and it
   is reported to hold this distinction globally. Ciguatoxins traverse the
   marine food web from primary producers, Gambierdiscus spp., to commonly
   consumed fish in tropical and subtropical regions of the world.
   Ciguatoxins comprise 12 known congeners among Caribbean and tropical
   Atlantic fish and 29 reported congeners among Pacific fish. Expanding
   trade in fisheries from ciguatera-endemic regions contributes to wider
   distribution and increasing frequency of disease among seafood consumers
   in non-endemic regions. Ciguatoxins produce a complex array of
   gastrointestinal, neurological and cardiological symptoms. Treatment
   options are very limited and supportive in nature. Information derived
   from the study of ciguatera outbreaks has improved clinical recognition,
   confirmation, and timely treatment. Such studies are equally important
   for the differentiation of ciguatoxin profiles in fish from one region
   to the next, the determination of toxicity thresholds in humans, and the
   formulation of safety limits. Analytical information from case and
   outbreak investigations was used to derive Pacific and Caribbean
   ciguatoxin threshold contamination rates for adverse effects in seafood
   consumers. To these threshold estimates 10-fold safety factors were
   applied to address individual human risk factors; uncertainty in the
   amount of fish consumed; and analytical accuracy. The studies may serve
   as the basis for industry and consumer advisory levels of 0.10 ppb
   C-CTX-1 equivalent toxicity in fish from the tropical Atlantic, Gulf of
   Mexico, Caribbean, and 0.01 ppb P-CTX-1 equivalent toxicity in fish from
   Pacific regions. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Climate change impacts are expected to produce more frequent, longer and
   unpredictable drought periods with further saltwater intrusion in the
   Marshall Islands. As a result, a significant return to traditional food
   cropping is unlikely. This will lead to an increased dependence on food
   aid, especially in the outer atoll populations. An examination of the
   nutritional content of food aid suggests it is likely to lead to poor
   health outcomes. Dependence on food aid has gradually increased over the
   past 70 years in the Marshall Islands, starting with population
   relocation because of war and nuclear testing and most recently because
   of climate change. The authors argue that the health impacts of the
   supplemental imported diet, combined with migration to population
   centers, may result in an even greater prevalence of chronic diseases,
   and exert pressures that lead to more communicable disease, further
   exacerbating the syndemics in the Marshall Islands. The authors conclude
   that food aid donors and the Republic of the Marshall Islands (RMI)
   government have human rights obligations to ensure that the people in
   the Marshall Islands have access to adequate nutrition. Accordingly,
   donors and the government should re-examine the content of food aid and
   ensure it is of sufficient quality to meet the right to health
   obligations.

AB The Central American Seaway played a pivotal role in shaping global
   climate throughout the late Cenozoic. Recent geological surveys have
   provided new constraints on timing of the seaway shoaling, while
   neodymium isotopic (epsilon(Nd)) data measured on fossil teeth, debris,
   and ferromanganese crusts have helped define the history of water masses
   in the region. Here we provide the first 3-D simulations of epsilon(Nd)
   responses to the shoaling seaway. Our model suggests that a narrow and
   shallow seaway is sufficient to affect interoceanic circulation, that
   inflow/outflow balance between the Caribbean and the Antilles responds
   nonlinearly to sill depth, and that a seaway narrower than 400km is
   consistent with an active Atlantic meridional overturning circulation
   during the late Miocene. Simulated epsilon(Nd) values in the Caribbean
   confirm that inputs from radiogenic Pacific waters in the Caribbean
   decrease as the seaway shoals. Despite model limitations, a comparison
   between our results and epsilon(Nd) values recorded in the Caribbean
   helps constrain the depth of the Central American Seaway through time,
   and we infer that a depth between 50 and 200m could have been reached
   10Ma ago.

AB Honiara's fresh horticultural markets are a critical component of the
   food distribution system in Guadalcanal, Solomon Islands. Most of the
   population that reside in Honiara are now dependent on the municipal
   horticultural market and a network of smaller road-side markets to
   source their fresh fruits and vegetables. Potentially poor postharvest
   supply chain practice could be leading to high levels of postharvest
   loss in Honiara markets, undermining domestic food security. This study
   reports on a preliminary assessment of postharvest horticultural market
   loss and associated supply chain logistics at the Honiara municipal
   market and five road-side markets on Guadalcanal Island. Using vendor
   recall to quantify loss, we surveyed a total of 198 vendors between
   November 2017 and March 2018. We found that postharvest loss in the
   Honiara municipal market was 7.9 to 9.5%, and that road-side markets
   incurred 2.6 to 7.0% loss. Based on mean postharvest market loss and the
   incidence of individual vendor loss, Honiara's road-side market system
   appears to be more effective in managing postharvest loss, compared to
   the municipal market. Postharvest loss was poorly correlated to
   transport distance, possibly due to the inter-island and remote
   intra-island chains avoiding high-perishable crops. Spatial mapping of
   postharvest loss highlighted a cohort of villages in the western and
   southern parts of the main horticultural production region (i.e.,
   eastern Guadalcanal) with atypically high levels of postharvest loss.
   The potential importance of market-operations, packaging type, and mode
   of transport on postharvest market loss, is further discussed.

AB Species of tropical fruit-flies (Diptera: Tephritidae: Dacinae) are the
   foremost horticultural pest in the Pacific region. In Papua New Guinea
   (PNG), limiting the movement of fresh fruits and vegetables ( = fresh
   commodities) between different regions within the country is one plant
   protection strategy that could lessen the threat posed by fruit-flies by
   restricting the spread of both exotic and indigenous pest species. In
   order to assess the risk posed by informal fruit and vegetable movement,
   we carried out a survey of Papua New Guinea domestic airline passengers.
   Of 1904 passengers surveyed, 38.9% were carrying fresh commodities. Over
   70 different fresh commodities were being carried, the most common being
   bananas and peanuts, each being carried by > 9% of passengers.
   Thirty-four of these 70 commodities are known fruit-fly hosts from PNG
   or other countries. Sixty-three per cent of passengers on flights into
   the National Capital District (i.e. Port Moresby) were carrying fruit,
   as were 74% of passengers leaving the Highland Provinces. Neither the
   purpose of travel nor the occupation type of a passenger influenced the
   likelihood of commodity carriage. Nearly all commodities came from
   gardens or local markets and were being carried predominantly for
   personal consumption or gifts. With fruit-fly infestation rates of
   susceptible crops being around 20%, we conclude that the risk of
   transport of fruit-flies is very high.

AB The Caribbean Sea encompasses a vast range of physical environmental
   conditions that have a profound influence on the organisms that live
   there. Here we utilize a range of satellite and in situ products to
   undertake a region-wide categorization of the physical environments of
   the Caribbean Sea (PECS). The classification approach is hierarchical
   and focuses on physical constraints that drive many aspects of coastal
   ecology, including species distributions, ecosystem function, and
   disturbance. The first level represents physicochemical properties
   including metrics of satellite sea surface temperature, water clarity,
   and in situ salinity. The second level considers mechanical disturbance
   and includes both chronic disturbance from wind-driven wave exposure and
   acute disturbance from hurricanes. The maps have a spatial resolution of
   1 km(2). An unsupervised neural network classification produced 16
   physicochemical provinces that can be categorized into six broad groups:
   (1) low water clarity and low salinity and average temperatures; (2) low
   water clarity but average salinity and temperature, broadly distributed
   in the basin; (3) low salinity but average water clarity and
   temperature; (4) upwelling; (5) high latitude; and (6) offshore waters
   of the inner Caribbean. Additional mechanical disturbance layers impose
   additional pattern that operates over different spatial scales. Because
   physical environments underpin so much of coastal ecosystem structure
   and function, we anticipate that the PECS classification, which will be
   freely distributed as geographic information system layers, will
   facilitate comparative analyses and inform the stratification of studies
   across environmental provinces in the Caribbean basin.

AB Sago haemolytic disease (SHD) is a rare but often fatal illness linked
   to consumption of stale sago starch in Papua New Guinea. Although the
   aetiology of SHD remains unknown, mycotoxins are suspected. This study
   investigated whether fungi isolated from Papua New Guinean sago starch
   were haemolytic. Filamentous fungi and yeasts from sago starch were
   grown on sheep blood agar and some on human blood agar. Clear haemolytic
   activity was demonstrated by 55% of filamentous fungal isolates, but not
   by yeasts. A semi-quantitative bioassay was developed involving
   incubation of human erythrocytes with fungal extracts. Extracts of
   cultures of Penicillium, Aspergillus and Fusarium all caused rapid
   haemolysis in the bioassay. Partial fractionation of extracts suggested
   that both polar and non-polar haemolytic components had haemolytic
   activity in vitro. Further work is warranted to identify these
   metabolites and determine if they play a role in SHD.

   similar species that also includes S. brooksi, S. bousfieldi, S.
   carpenteri, and S. chacei. Synalpheus irie n. sp. is a highly
   distinctive shrimp most similar to S. mcclendoni, but can be
   distinguished from the latter by the unique bowl-shaped fingers of the
   major chela and the two-pronged distal protuberance on the palm of the
   major chela. Synalpheus belizensis and S. regalis are reported for the
   first time from outside their type localities in Belize, while S. bocas
   and S. duffyi are reported for the first time outside their type

AB The 1983-1984 mass mortality of the sea urchin Diadema antillarum
   remains one of the most severe die-offs ever recorded in the Caribbean.
   Before 1983, the herbivore D. antillarum was pervasive on coral reefs in
   the region. Nine months after first detection of the mass mortality, 95%
   of the urchins had perished, and algal cover of coral increased between
   100% and 250%. A water-borne pathogen was hypothesized as the causative
   agent, but it was never isolated. To date, surface current patterns have
   been used exclusively to explain both the cause and the distribution
   patterns of The mortality event. Using archived satellite images,
   were-examined the water-borne pathogen hypothesis and investigated
   whether other mechanisms could also account for the dissemination
   pattern in some areas. In addition, archived satellite images were
   utilized to detect changes in coral reef reflectance, For infections in
   the Gulf of Mexico and Bermuda, satellite images confirm that surface
   currents are likely responsible for the distribution of the pathogen.
   For infections in the eastern Caribbean (Curacao, U.S. Virgin Islands,
   Barbados), however, another mechanism, possibly ballast water exchange,
   must be considered because the surface current and infection patterns do
   not coincide. Changes in coral reflectance were detectable from Landsat
   thermatic mapping data before and after the mass mortality and
   correspond to the change in algal cover. Results from our study
   demonstrate the Potential of satellite images for use in determining
   connectivity between regions of the Caribbean and in detecting changes
   in coral reef cover.

AB Freshwater fishes are an important but relatively little known component
   of the highly diverse fish fauna of Micronesia. Localities supporting
   communities of freshwater fishes include large high islands, with
   considerable habitat complexity, and smaller low islands, such as atolls
   and raised coral islands, with limited freshwater habitat. Both types of
   islands may support species with adult life history styles that are (a)
   amphidromous and catadromous, (b) euryhaline (often estuarine), or (c)
   marine species which enter freshwater from time to time. We compared
   patterns of species richness and similarity between Micronesian
   localities for amphidromous and catadromous, euryhaline and marine
   species (ACEM) pooled, and for amphidromous and catadromous species
   (ACFW). Species richness of both ACEM and ACFW fishes was greatest on
   larger high islands compared to smaller high and all low islands.
   Cluster analysis of similarity indices for ACEM species between
   localities revealed two faunal components: high islands and low islands.
   High islands were further partitioned into a Caroline Islands cluster
   and a separate Mariana Islands cluster. Cluster analysis of ACFW species
   was more complex. One cluster consisted of a low island and a small high
   island, both in the Carolines chain and with limited freshwater habitat.
   The second cluster was partitioned into high islands and low islands
   that reflected influences of both size and geographical location.

AB Remote island nations face a number of challenges in addressing concerns
   about shark population status, including access to rigorously collected
   data and resources to manage fisheries. At present, very little data are
   available on shark populations in the Solomon Islands and scientific
   surveys to document shark and ray diversity and distribution have not
   been completed. We aimed to provide a baseline of the relative abundance
   and diversity of reef sharks and rays and assess the major drivers of
   reef shark abundance/biomass in the Western Province of the Solomon
   Islands using stereo baited remote underwater video. On average reef
   sharks were more abundant than in surrounding countries such as Fiji and
   Indonesia, yet below that of remote islands without historical fishing
   pressure, suggesting populations are relatively healthy but not
   pristine. We also assessed the influence of location, habitat
   type/complexity, depth and prey biomass on reef shark abundance and
   biomass. Location was the most important factor driving reef shark
   abundance and biomass with two times the abundance and a 43% greater
   biomass of reef sharks in the more remote locations, suggesting fishing
   may be impacting sharks in some areas. Our results give a much needed
   baseline and suggest that reef shark populations are still relatively
   unexploited, providing an opportunity for improved management of sharks
   and rays in the Solomon Islands.

AB Indo-Pacific lionfish, Pterois spp., are opportunistic carnivores that
   have established invasive populations off the southeastern United
   States, The Bahamas, the Caribbean, and off the northern coast of South
   America. Because lionfish have few natural predators in their invasive
   range, a proposed option for controlling populations and limiting
   ecological damage is to establish directed fisheries for the species and
   promote their consumption by humans. However, carnivorous marine fishes
   can contain high levels of mercury, a toxic, heavy-metal pollutant that
   can cause neurological and behavioral impairment in humans. We analyzed
   total mercury levels in dorsal muscle tissue from 260 lionfish collected
   along Florida's Gulf of Mexico and Atlantic coasts. Fish were collected
   from offshore waters corresponding to four coastal regions the southeast
   Atlantic, the Florida Keys, the southwest Gulf of Mexico, and the
   Florida Panhandle. Fish ranged in size from 63 to 262 mm standard length
   (mean = 153 mm), and mercury levels ranged from 0.01 to 0.34 mg kg(-1)
   (mean = 0.07 mg kg(-1)). The mean mercury level in fish larger than 180
   mm standard length, which are commonly represented in Florida's
   commercial fisheries, was 0.09 mg kg(-1). Mercury levels increased
   logarithmically with fish length in all regions. Mercury levels did not
   differ between males and females, but there were differences among
   regions, with the greatest concentrations seen in fish from the Florida
   Keys and highest bioaccumulation rates from the southwest Gulf of Mexico
   study region. Mercury levels in lionfish were similar to those in marine
   and estuarine species that fall under Florida's least restrictive
   consumption advisory levels for the general human population.

AB New Guinea is one of the last remaining regions of extensive tropical
   forest and is an important biodiversity hotspot, yet most of its canopy
   ant species are poorly known. Here, we provide the first study of
   arboricolous ant communities of the genus Camponotus MAYR, 1861 from a
   lowland rainforest in New Guinea. We censused Camponotus nests in trees
   from two 0.32 ha forest plots in primary forest (389 trees) and
   secondary forest (296 trees) and explored their species diversity and
   nesting preferences. In total, 293 nests of 19 species were found. In 16
   of the 19 species, major workers exhibited a set of morphological traits
   (i.e., flattened anterior part of head, swollen fore femora and maximal
   distance between frontal carinae greater than a third of head width)
   associated with phragmosis, an adaptation for arboricolous nesting. In
   primary forest, we detected 15 species in 124 nests versus only eight
   species in 169 nests in secondary forest. Only four species were shared
   between the two forest plots. Camponotus species differed significantly
   in their preferences for nesting microhabitats in both forest plots,
   ranging from species that were opportunistic and relatively abundant to
   those that specialized and nested only in living tree branches high in
   the canopy where they tended myrmecophilous scale insects. Of the 19
   species collected, 13 are newly reported for New Guinea, including four
   that are described here as new species: Camponotus anezkae sp.n.,
   Camponotus rotundus sp.n., Camponotus triangulatus sp.n. and Camponotus
   wanangus sp.n. In addition, Camponotus aruensis KARAVAIEV, 1933 is
   redescribed. Diagnostic features for species identification, digital
   photos of all available castes and morphological measurements are
   provided. The study demonstrates the high diversity of arboricolous
   Camponotus ants and their nesting habits within a single tropical forest
   site.

AB Native prey can be particularly vulnerable to consumption by exotic
   predators. Prey naivete, the failure to recognize a novel predator due
   to lack of recent co-evolutionary history, likely facilitates the
   disproportionate impact that some exotic predators exert on prey
   populations. Lionfish Pterois volitans, exotic predators from the
   Pacific, have invaded coral reefs and other coastal habitats along the
   western Atlantic. Prey naivete towards novel lionfish was tested in
   field experiments and with observations using closest approach distance
   as the anti-predator response. We quantified the distance of prey fishes
   to exotic lionfish in both the Atlantic and Pacific (invasive and native
   ranges of lionfish) as well as to native predators in the Atlantic. In
   the Atlantic, experiments indicated that Haemulon plumierii, prey of
   lionfish, generally display a closer approach distance to exotic than to
   native predators, and field observations of free-ranging fish revealed
   that at least 5 other species of small fishes (Halichoeres bivitattus,
   Halichoeres garnoti, Scarus taeniopterus, Stegastes leucostictus and
   Thalassoma bifasciatum) also might exhibit limited predator-avoidance
   behaviour towards invasive lionfish. We also found that 3 families of
   small fish (Labridae, Pomacentridae and Scaridae) maintained greater
   distances from lionfish in the Pacific compared with the Atlantic in
   both experimental and field observations. These results suggest prey
   naivete to exotic lionfish by at least 8 species of fish (Abudefduf
   saxatilis, H. plumierii, H. bivitattus, H. garnoti, S. taeniopterus,
   Sparisoma aurofrenatum, S. leucostictus and T. bifasciatum) in the
   Atlantic, which could be contributing to the rapid expansion of this
   invasive species by enhancing its fitness and reproductive output
   through high predation efficiency.

   diurnal to interannual variation of the raindrop size distribution (DSD)
   over Palau in the Western Pacific warm pool. The DSD variability was
   primarily seasonal, with a secondary contribution due to the El Nino
   Southern Oscillation (ENSO) cycle. We did not find evidence of a diurnal
   cycle. In the seasonal cycle, mean drop diameters tended to increase
   during the westerly monsoon period. Within this period, drop diameters
   generally increased during the El Nino year and decreased during the La
   Nina year. However, within the easterly monsoon period, they generally
   increased in the winter following La Nina, and decreased in the winter
   following El Nino. The amplitude of the seasonal variation in mean drop
   diameter was approximately the same as that in Singapore and Sumatra,
   and about one third of that in India. Citation: Ushiyama, T., K. Krishna

   observed stratification in the boundary layer. The vertical profiles of
   various aerosol characterizations were similar on both days and show
   three layers with distinct aerosol and thermodynamic characteristics:
   the Saharan Air Layer (SAL; similar to 2.2km500m), a subcloud layer
   (SCL; surface to similar to 500m), and an intermediate layer extending
   between them. The SAL and SCL display well-mixed aerosol and
   thermodynamic characteristics; but the most significant horizontal and
   vertical variations in aerosols and thermodynamics occur in the
   intermediate layer. The aerosol variability observed in the intermediate
   layer is likely associated with modification by shallow cumulus
   convection occurring sometime in the prior history of the air mass as it
   is advected across the Atlantic. A comparison of the thermodynamic
   structure observed in the event from its origin over Africa with that
   when it reached Barbados indicates that the lower part of the SAL was
   moistened by surface fluxes as the air mass was advected across the
   Atlantic. Mixing diagrams using aerosol concentrations and water vapor
   mixing ratios as conserved parameters provide insight into the vertical
   transports and mixing processes that may explain the observed aerosol
   and thermodynamic variability in each layer.

AB First impressions suggest that the risk of soil loss through fluvial
   erosion from land under cultivation is considerable in the Southern
   Highlands Province of Papua New Guinea. The climate is very wet all year
   round, the terrain precipitous, and people regularly farm on steep
   slopes. The Wola-speaking people, who occupy a series of valleys in the
   centre of the province, and who practice a semi-shifting form of
   cultivation, are nonetheless off-hand about soil conservation and
   declare that erosion is not a serious problem. This paper assesses the
   status of their assertions by calculating potential soil loss rates. It
   applies the universal soil loss equation to data on rainfall erosivity,
   soil erodibility, slope length and steepness, vegetation cover and
   conservation measures, to compute likely runoff losses. The calculations
   suggest that, the steep slopes cultivated and wet climate
   notwithstanding, the local population's assessment of the dangers of
   erosion is realistic and not reckless. Although rainfall is high, it is
   rarely of an intensity sufficient to threaten serious soil erosion
   losses. The physical properties of the soils, which feature volcanic ash
   components and high organic matter levels, are such that they are
   particularly resistant to erosion. The staple crop of the region, sweet
   potato (Ipomoea batatas), also gives particularly good ground cover and
   protection when established, effectively shielding the soil from erosive
   rainfall.

AB Small islands are territories that are subject to different
   environmental, economic and social problems and pressures. Strategic
   Environmental Assessment (SEA) is a systematic approach that integrates
   sustainability issues into policies, plans and programmes promoting the
   participation of different stakeholders including the communities. In
   this research an integrative review is performed to identify, explore
   and discuss the academic outlook on sustainability in small islands and
   SEA in their decision-making context. The study is justified by the
   pressing need to find suitable responses for integrating sustainability
   into small islands through the decision-making process. The review was
   conducted through academic literature that focused on sustainability and
   environmental assessment in islands from the last 15 years. The
   documents were analysed through a content analysis based approach where
   they were coded with pre-determined categories according with the 14
   priority areas identified in the Barbados Programme of Action and the
   three additional priority areas from the Mauritius Strategy for
   addressing the special challenges faced by Small Islands Developing
   States. From the review it is understood that it is still not clear what
   sustainability is for small islands or what is the best approach to
   achieve it. However, three key arguments, linked with SEA, emerged from
   the discussion on how to enhance sustainability in these territories (i)
   change in decision-making paradigm, (ii) good governance and community
   empowerment and, (iii) resilience. SEA can help to put forward these
   three "sustainability enhancers" since SEA approaches addressed them,
   yet, it is necessary to develop or rethink a framework for SEA in these
   territories, promote SEA research for small islands and stimulate
   capacity-building. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB A theoretical method which can evaluate directly various kinetic

   thermogravimetric curve has been established. Although this theory is
   believed to be capable of being applied to the thermogravimetry of
   universal solid matter except those having peculiar behaviors, as an
   example applying this theory, it is tentatively used to analyze the
   reaction of char and carbon dioxide to carbon monoxide at a temperature
   range of 750-1,000 degrees C. Samples used consisted of cellulose, and
   domestic woods and barks of beech (Fagus crenata Bl.) and larch (Larix
   leptolepis Gord.) treated with dilute solutions of hydrochloric acid or
   sodium hydroxide, and tropical woods from Ogasawara, Papua New Guinea,
   Sumatra, Philippines and Cambodia, Large differences in kinetic
   parameters existed among the samples. In general, it appears that
   samples rich in ash show smaller values. Furthermore, although unusual
   values observed in part of ash rich samples seem to be based on metal
   formation by the reduction of metal salt included in the ash, its
   progressive participation in the reaction as a catalyst and sublimation
   of various matters concerned ash.

AB Tropical island species and ecosystems are threatened worldwide as a
   result of increasing human pressure. Yet some of these islands also lend
   themselves to restoration, as they are physically defined units that can
   be given focused attention, as long as resources are available and clear
   conservation targets are set. Cousine Island, Seychelles, is a tropical
   island that has received such intensive restoration. From a highly
   degraded island in the 1960s, the island has now been restored to what
   is believed to be a semblance of the natural state. All alien
   vertebrates have been eradicated, as have 25 invasive alien plants.
   Cultivated plants are now confined to one small section of the island.
   Poaching of nesting marine turtles has been stopped, leading to an
   increase in turtle breeding numbers. The shearwater population has
   increased in size with poaching activities under control. The Sooty tern
   has also returned to the island to breed. The coastal plain has been
   restored with over 2,500 indigenous shrubs and trees, which have now
   grown into a forest carpet. There are strict quarantine procedures on
   the island, keeping it free of rats, mice, various alien invertebrates
   and potentially invasive alien plants. Three threatened Seychelles
   endemic land birds (Seychelles warbler, Seychelles magpie robin and
   Seychelles white-eye) have been introduced and are thriving, with these
   introductions contributing to both the magpie robin and the white-eye
   being downgraded from CR to EN (the warbler remains at VU). Ecotourism,
   and nature conservation for the local inhabitants, have been introduced
   in a way that does not reduce the improved compositional, structural and
   functional biodiversity of the island. The result of the restoration
   effort appears to be sustainable in the long term, although challenges
   still remain, especially with regards to adequate clean water and a
   non-polluting power supply on the island. Cousine is thus paving the way
   in the art and science of tropical island restoration as a legacy for
   future generations.

AB Market preferences of natural resources contribute to shape their
   exploitation and production. Beche-de-mer, the product after gutting,
   cooking, salting and drying sea cucumbers, is exported worldwide to
   Asian dried seafood markets. A better understanding of the trade, value
   and market preferences of Pacific island beche-de-mer could identify
   critical postharvest processing techniques and management strategies for
   fisheries and aquaculture. Data were collected on export prices and
   trade of beche-de-mer from Kiribati, Fiji, Tonga and New Caledonia, and
   the selling prices, respective sizes and organoleptic properties of the
   products in stores in China. Export prices varied considerably within
   and among the four countries and low-value species were the most
   exported by volume. Most of the beche-de-mer from the four Pacific
   islands is exported to Hong Kong, where quality products are sold and
   others are distributed to mainland China. Prices of the beche-de-mer in
   Chinese stores varied up to ten-fold and were mostly influenced by
   species, body size and, to a lesser extent, physical damage to the
   products. Market prices across species (averaging US$15-385 kg(-1))
   appear to have mostly increased six-to twelve-fold over the past decade.
   The data allude that fisheries for Holothuria scabra, H. lessoni, H.
   fuscogilva, H. whitmaei and Thelenota ananas should be most carefully
   managed because they were the highest-value species and under greatest
   demand. The relationships between size of beche-de-mer and sale price
   were species specific and highly varied. This study also highlights the
   need for better regulations and/or enforcement of minimum size limits in
   sea cucumber fisheries, which can help to maximise economic benefits of
   wild stocks.

AB Over the past decade, development along the northern coast of Jamaica
   has accelerated, resulting in elevated levels of sedimentation on
   adjacent reefs. To understand the effects of this development on sponge
   community dynamics, we conducted surveys at three locations with varying
   degrees of adjacent coastal development to quantify species richness,
   abundance and diversity at two depths (8-10 m and 15-18 m). Sediment
   accumulation rate, total suspended solids and other water quality
   parameters were also quantified. The sponge community at the location
   with the least coastal development and anthropogenic influence was often
   significantly different from the other two locations, and exhibited
   higher sponge abundance, richness, and diversity. Sponge community
   composition and size distribution were statistically different among
   locations. This study provides correlative evidence that coastal
   development affects aspects of sponge community ecology, although the
   precise mechanisms are still unclear. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

AB Timor-Leste has had three rounds of major elections, all of which have
   been widely regarded as meeting international criteria for being free
   and fair. There has also been one change of government on the basis of
   these elections. On these grounds, some observers have suggested that
   Timor-Leste has met the benchmark for having consolidated its democracy.
   Timor-Leste can be said to meet the criteria for an expanded minimalist
   definition of democracy, holding regular, free and fair elections within
   an open competitive political environment, with relatively little
   violence and intimidation and general freedom of expression. This
   political process has, as defined by the literature, also consolidated.
   However, Timor-Leste continues to face future economic challenges. The
   literature indicates that states with high levels of poverty,
   unemployment and with food shortages are more prone to political
   instability. Given that Timor-Leste's political party system relies
   heavily on charismatic individuals and, apart from Fretilin, has poor
   party structures, loss of current political leaders will add a further
   destabilising effect. Expected economic problems are likely to manifest
   around the same time that the current generation of political leaders
   are no longer active. The question will be, in this increasingly
   challenging environment, whether Timor-Leste can sustain its democracy.

AB The circulation near the western boundary of the South Pacific is
   described on the basis of water properties and geostrophic velocities
   measured on a meridional section along 155E through the East Australian
   and Coral Basins. The section was occupied in winter 1993 as part of the
   World Ocean Circulation Experiment (WOCE, Section P11S). The primary
   objective of P11 was to quantify the zonal flows entering and leaving
   the western boundary of the basin.
   The primary inflow to the Tasman and Coral seas is supplied by the South
   Equatorial Current (SEC), which crosses the P11 section as a wide band
   of westward flow between 14 and 18S with a total geostrophic transport
   of 55 Sv (1 Sv = 10(6) m(3)/s) relative to the bottom. The SEC
   bifurcates at the Australian coast near 18S: 29 Sv turns south to feed
   the East Australian Current (EAC), and 26 Sv recirculates in the Gulf of
   Papua New Guinea as a low-latitude western boundary current (the Great
   Barrier Reef and New Guinea Coastal Undercurrents, GBRUC/NGCUC). The
   NGCUC closes the tropical gyre, and carries South Pacific water around
   the Louisiade Archipelago and through the Solomon Sea to the equator.
   The core of the EAC lies over the continental slope between 18S and 30S.
   A system of deep-reaching, recirculating eddies or gyres is located
   offshore of the EAC. At 30S the EAC separates from the coast, and the
   steeply sloping isopycnals associated with the current persist from the
   surface to the bottom. The total geostrophic transport of the EAC after
   separation is 57 Sv relative to the bottom. After separation from the
   coast, more than half of the EAC (33 Sv) recirculates north and then
   west, crossing P11 again at 28S. The remainder (24 Sv) continues east as
   a meandering jet across the Tasman Sea (the Tasman Front).
   The circulation in the southern part of the Tasman Sea is dominated by
   transient eddies and standing gyres. An anticyclonic circulation
   facilitates the exchange of water between the Tasman Sea and the
   Southern Ocean. About 10Sv of subantarctic water spreads north to
   36-38S, then recirculates back to the west to merge with a weak
   southward flow of modified subtopical water near the Tasmanian coast.
   The circulation in the deeper Layers consists of a weak northward deep
   western boundary current, a cyclonic recirculation filling the Tasman
   Basin, and a net export of about 3 Sv of deep water to the Coral Sea.
   The transport of mode and intermediate water in the low-latitude western
   boundary current crossing P11 is similar to the transport in these
   density classes further "upstream" in the subtropical gyre at 32S. This
   suggests that the mode and intermediate waters entering the Pacific from
   the south to compensate the export through the Indonesian passages are
   carried north to the tropical western Pacific primarily along
   isopycnals.

AB In many Least Developed Countries and Small Island Developing States,
   such as in Kiribati, formal national adaptation programmes are currently
   being operationalised. A key focus is enhancing the adaptive capacity of
   vulnerable communities through piloting of sectoral adaptation
   strategies such as diversifying water resources. This study argues that
   fundamental to water management and adaptation planning is the
   integration of people's cultural values attached to the assets/resources
   they control and utilise in their efforts to adapt to various stresses
   on water resources. The results from integrating cultural resources into
   a Sustainable Livelihoods Framework indicate that people's capacity to
   diversify is constrained by cultural processes negotiated in their daily
   lives that reinforced and reproduced hardships. Material resources
   provided personal significance when they were spent on maintaining
   social identity, expressed in recent times through the church. Thus
   fewer resources were available for pursuing a diversification strategy.
   Furthermore, power structures in the church delimited benefits to the
   individual, depriving people of their freedom to exercise autonomous
   agency and achieve personal wellbeing. The study demonstrates the
   significance of religion to adaptation. Moreover, it highlights the need
   to consider the relational aspects of assets, in conditioning how people
   access and utilise assets in pursuing adaptation strategies. (C) 2009

AB The deep ocean is the largest and least-explored ecosystem on Earth, and
   a uniquely energy-poor environment. The distribution, drivers and
   origins of deep-sea biodiversity remain unknown at global scales(1-3).
   Here we analyse a database of more than 165,000 distribution records of
   Ophiuroidea (brittle stars), a dominant component of sea-floor fauna,
   and find patterns of biodiversity unlike known terrestrial or coastal
   marine realms. Both patterns and environmental predictors of deep-sea
   (2,000-6,500m) species richness fundamentally differ from those found in
   coastal (0-20 m), continental shelf (20-200 m), and upper-slope
   (200-2,000 m) waters. Continental shelf to upper-slope richness
   consistently peaks in tropical Indo-west Pacific and Caribbean (0-30
   degrees) latitudes, and is well explained by variations in water
   temperature. In contrast, deep-sea species show maximum richness at
   higher latitudes (30-50 degrees), concentrated in areas of high carbon
   export flux and regions close to continental margins. We reconcile this
   structuring of oceanic biodiversity using a species-energy framework,
   with kinetic energy predicting shallow-water richness, while chemical
   energy (export productivity) and proximity to slope habitats drive
   deep-sea diversity. Our findings provide a global baseline for
   conservation efforts across the sea floor, and demonstrate that deep-sea
   ecosystems show a biodiversity pattern consistent with ecological
   theory, despite being different from other planetary-scale habitats.

AB The study of human behaviour and in particular individual choices is of
   great interest in the field of environmental economics. Substantial
   attention has been paid to the way in which preferences vary across
   individuals, and there is a realisation that such differences are at
   least in part due to underlying attitudes and convictions. While this
   has been confirmed in empirical work, the methods typically employed are
   based on the arguably misguided use of responses to attitudinal
   questions as direct measures of underlying attitudes. As discussed in
   other literature, especially in transport research, this potentially
   leads to measurement error and endogeneity bias, and attitudes should
   rather be treated as latent variables. In this paper, we illustrate the
   use of such an Integrated Choice and Latent Variable model in the
   context of beach visitors' willingness-to-pay for improvements in water
   quality. We show how a latent attitudinal variable, which we refer to as
   a pro-intervention attitude, helps explain both the responses from the
   stated choice exercise as well as answers to various rating questions
   related to respondent attitudes. The incorporation of the latent
   variable leads to important gains in model fit and substantially
   different willingness-to-pay patterns.

AB Phylogenetic diversity-area curves are analogous to species-area curves
   and quantify the relationship between the phylogenetic diversity of
   species assemblages and the area over which assemblages are sampled.
   Here, we developed theoretical expectations of these curves under
   different ecological and macroevolutionary processes. We first used
   simulations to generate curves expected under three ecological community
   assembly processes: species sorting, where species have distinct
   environmental preferences; random placement, where species have no
   environmental preference but vary in their prevalence across
   communities; and limited dispersal, where species have no environmental
   preference but vary in their ability to disperse. Second, we simulated
   curves expected across regions (e.g., across oceanic islands) that are
   derived from colonization among regions, within-region speciation, and
   extinction. We also computed curves for two data sets, one on forest
   plots along an elevation gradient and the other on Caribbean island
   Anolis lizards. Of the three ecological processes, only species sorting
   produced strong relationships between phylogenetic diversity and area.
   The forest plot curves matched the species-sorting expectation, but only
   when phylogenetic repulsion (that caused closely related species to be
   found in similar habitats but not in the same plots) was also included
   in the simulation. Strong relationships between regional phylogenetic
   diversity and area were simulated if species were derived only from
   within-region speciation; colonizations among regions obscured the
   pattern. Similarly, larger Caribbean islands had more within-island
   speciation and contained more Anolis phylogenetic diversity than smaller
   islands, but colonizations among islands obscured this relationship.
   This work furthers our understanding of the processes that govern the
   phylogenetic diversity of ecological communities and biogeographic
   regions.

AB P>In aquatic ecosystems, water flow mediates the delivery of
   reproductive propagules, competition and predation, each of which may
   have contrasting effects on biodiversity. Here, we show that water flow
   has a net positive effect on the biodiversity of benthic invertebrate
   communities in three biogeographic regions. In Palau and Alaska, flow
   velocity predicted 55-91% of the variance in species richness in natural
   communities. In experimental communities in Alaska and Maine, enhanced
   water flow treatments resulted in higher levels of species density
   (+56%) and richness (+74%), which were predicted by the abundance of
   locally rare species. Additionally, the richness of recruitment was
   higher in experimentally enhanced flows (+46%). Thus, the data suggest
   that flow drives diversity by mediating the delivery of rare species in
   multiple biogeographic regions. Consequently, flow velocity should be
   included in future developments of diversity theory and conservation
   strategy.

AB [1] A nested grid ocean circulation modeling system is used to examine
   the circulation, dispersion, and hydrodynamic connectivity of surface
   waters on the Belizean shelf. The nested grid system consists of a
   coarse-resolution ( similar to 19 km) outer model of the western
   Caribbean Sea, an intermediate-resolution ( similar to 6 km) middle
   model of the southern Meso-American Barrier Reef System (MBRS), and a
   fine-resolution ( similar to 2 km) inner model of the Belizean shelf.
   The nested system is forced by climatological monthly mean surface
   forcing and integrated over 5 years. The near-surface circulation on the
   Belize shelf produced by the inner model is characterized by a strong
   and persistent northwestward flow as a direct influence of the Caribbean
   Current on the northwestern shelf and a weak and spatially variable flow
   on the inner and southern shelf. The monthly mean model currents are
   used to calculate retention and dispersion of conservative, near-surface
   particles carried by the ocean currents. The near-surface dispersion is
   relatively higher in areas seaward ( east) of Lighthouse and Glovers
   Reef atolls and lower on the inner shelf, particularly within the Inner
   Channel and in the vicinity of South Water Cay. To examine hydrodynamic
   connectivity of reefs in the surface waters of the Belize shelf, we
   calculate upstream and downstream retention areas for coral reefs at
   Turneffe Islands and Glovers Reef atolls. The potential sources of
   passive, near-surface particle supply reaching these two reef atolls
   within 30 days include both the shallow waters surrounding the two
   sites, the deep waters between them, and the coastal waters of the Bay
   Islands ( Honduras). The 30-day downstream retention areas of the
   Turneffe and Glovers Reef atolls cover the central and southern Belize
   shelf, respectively.

AB Gene flow was shown to be limited between western and eastern Caribbean
   populations of the reef-building coral, Acropora palmata. However, some
   mixing was detected among populations near Puerto Rico. Our genetic
   analyses categorize A. palmata samples from the east coast of the
   Dominican Republic with the western Caribbean population, suggesting a
   filter to gene flow east of the Dominican Republic. To test the
   hypothesis of a present day bio-oceanographic filter occurring between
   Puerto Rico and the Dominican Republic (i.e., in the Mona Passage), we
   used a Lagrangian stochastic model (LSM) of larval dispersal, coupling
   coral life history characteristics with physical forcing. The model
   operated at two spatial scales: Caribbean-wide and focusing on the Mona
   Passage area. Results from the Caribbean-wide study showed no
   significant virtual larval exchange between the two populations. The
   small-scale model indicated that virtual larvae do not readily traverse
   the Mona Passage during the corals' reproductive season. Larvae released
   from Mona Island, in the center of the passage, are retained in the lee
   within topographically steered eddies, which act, together with the
   larval competency period, as a de facto filter to dispersal. Combined,
   our findings reveal the location of a seasonal filter to gene flow and
   its mechanism.

   trigonorostris (Yokoya, 1933) from Japan; M. tropis n. sp. from Japan;
   and M. tsugaruensis n. sp. from Japan. These species are classified into
   two informal species groups. The new species are fully described and
   illustrated. Some previously known species, for which detailed
   descriptions along modern standards are deemed necessary, are
   redescribed. Metacrangon asiaticus is elevated from a subspecies of M.
   variabilis to full species status. A key to aid in the identification of
   the western Pacific species is provided. Bathymetrical and geographical
   distributions of the treated species are summarized. It is strongly

   highest in waters around the Japanese Archipelago (17 of the 41 known
   species occur in the areas).

AB Clearing forests for oil palm plantations is a major threat to tropical
   terrestrial biodiversity, and may potentially have large impacts on
   downstream marine ecosystems (e.g., coral reefs). However, little is
   known about the impacts of runoff from oil palm plantations, so it is
   not clear how oil palm development should be modified to minimize the
   risk of degrading marine ecosystems, or how marine conservation plans
   should be modified to account for the impacts of oil palm development.
   We coupled terrestrial and marine biophysical models to simulate changes
   in sediment/nutrient composition on reefs as a result of oil palm
   development in Papua New Guinea, and predicted the response of coral and
   seagrass ecosystems to different land-use scenarios. The condition of
   almost 60% of coastal ecosystems were predicted to be substantially
   degraded (more than a 50% decline from their initial state) after 5
   years if all suitable land was converted to oil palm, with only 4% of
   coastal ecosystems improving in condition as trees matured. We evaluated
   marine ecosystem condition if the oil palm developments were consistent
   with global sustainability guidelines and found that there were only
   slight improvements in ecosystems condition compared to the scenario
   with complete conversion of forest to oil palm. Substantially reducing
   the impact of oil palm development on marine ecosystems required
   limiting new plantings to hill slopes below 15, a more stringent
   restriction than currently allowed for in the sustainability guidelines.
   We evaluated priority marine conservation areas given current land-use
   and found reef ecosystems in these areas will likely be heavily degraded
   in the future from runoff. We find that marine conservation plans should
   be modified to prioritize turbid areas where coral communities may be
   more tolerant of increased suspended sediment in the water. The approach
   developed here provides guidelines for modifying marine conservation
   priorities in areas with oil palm development. Importantly, oil palm
   development guidelines cannot be truly ecologically sustainable unless
   they are modified to account for the impacts of oil palm on coastal
   marine ecosystems. (C) 2016 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB The final phase of the closure of the Panamanian Gateway and the
   intensification of Northern Hemisphere Glaciation (NHG) both occurred
   during the Late Pliocene. Glacial-interglacial (G-IG) variations in sea
   level might, therefore, have had a significant impact on the remaining
   connections between the East Pacific and the Caribbean. Here, we present
   combined foraminiferal Mg/Ca and delta O-18 measurements from Ocean
   Drilling Program (ODP) Site 1241 from the East Pacific and ODP Site 999
   from the Caribbean. The studied time interval covers the first three
   major G-IG Marine Isotope Stages (MIS 95-100, similar to 2.5 Ma) after
   the intensification of NHG. Analyses were performed on the planktonic
   foraminifera Neogloboquadrina dutertrei and Globigerinoides sacculifer,
   representing water mass properties in the thermocline and the
   mixed-layer, respectively. Changes in sea water temperature, relative
   salinity, and water column stratification strongly suggest that the
   Panamanian Gateway temporarily closed during glacial MIS 98 and 100, as
   a result of changes in ice volume equivalent to a drop in sea level of
   60-90 m. Reconstructed sea surface temperatures (SST) from G. sacculifer
   show a glacial decrease of 2.5 degrees C at Site 1241, but increases of
   up to 3 degrees C at Site 999 during glacial MIS 98 and 100 suggesting
   that the Panamanian Gateway closed during these glacial periods. The
   Mg/Ca-temperatures of N. dutertrei remain relatively stable in the East
   Pacific, but do show a 3 degrees C warming in the Caribbean at the onset
   of these glacial periods suggesting that the closing of the gateway also
   changed the water column stratification. We infer that the glacial
   closure of the gateway allowed the Western Atlantic Warm Pool to extend
   into the southern Caribbean, increasing SST (G. sacculifer) and
   deepening the thermocline (N. dutertrei). Additionally, ice volume
   appears to have become large enough during MIS 100 to survive the
   relatively short lasting interglacial MIS 99 so that the gateway
   remained closed. Towards the end of MIS 98, during MIS 97 and into MIS
   96 temperatures on both sides are mostly similar suggesting water masses
   exchanged again. Additionally, Caribbean variations in SST and delta
   O-18(water) follow a precession-like cyclicity rather than the
   obliquity-controlled variations characteristic of the East Pacific and
   many other tropical areas, suggesting that regional atmospheric
   processes related to the trade winds and the InterTropical Convergence
   Zone (ITCZ) had a dominant impact in the Caribbean. (C) 2014 Elsevier

AB In the present work, nine years of altimetry data are analyzed in
   combination with sea surface temperature and ocean color images in order
   to track Brazil Current eddies generated at Cape Sao Tome, Brazil.
   Direct evidences are presented that at least six eddies detach from the
   main current during this period giving rise to isolated rings. Two rings
   move southward, bordering the current, while four migrate northward, and
   translate in the direction of the Tubarao Bight. These rings eventually
   reach the bight, leading to a cyclonic circulation in that region that
   is analogous, at surface levels, to what would be observed during
   formation of the Vitoria Eddy. For one ring, the observations are
   complemented by in situ measurements: a Lagrangian surface drifter, an
   expandable bathythermograph section during the ring formation at Cape
   Sao Tome, and acoustic Doppler current profiler data during the ring
   formation and inside the bight. The cyclonic circulation within the
   bight in this occasion reaches levels much deeper than those previously
   reported for locally-generated eddies. These results indicate that
   properties of shelf and slope waters near Cape Sao Tome can be carried
   upstream the Brazil Current, eventually influencing the coastal waters
   further north, with possible ecological and environmental implications.

AB Less than a decade after being observed off Florida, the invasive
   Indo-Pacific lionfish is now widely distributed off the southeast coast
   of the United States. As a step towards measuring invasion impacts to
   native communities, we examine the magnitude and extent of this invasion
   by first, compiling reports of lionfish to provide range information and
   second, estimate lionfish abundance from two separate studies. We also
   estimate native grouper (epinepheline serranids) abundance to better
   assess and compare lionfish abundances. In the first study we conducted
   SCUBA diver visual transect surveys at 17 different locations off the
   North Carolina coast in water depths of 35 - 50 m. In the second study,
   we conducted 27 Remote Operated Vehicle (ROV) transect surveys at five
   locations from Florida to North Carolina in water depths of 50 - 100 m.
   In both studies, lionfish were found to be second in abundance only to
   scamp (Mycteroperca phenax). Lionfish were found in higher abundance in
   the shallower North Carolina SCUBA surveys ((x) over bar 21: 2 ha(-1))
   than in the deep water ROV surveys ((x) over bar 5: 2 ha(-1)). Lionfish
   reports continue to expand most recently into the Bahamas, raising the
   specter of further spread into the Caribbean and Gulf of Mexico. The
   potential impacts of lionfish to native communities are likely to be
   through direct predation, competition and overcrowding. The high number
   of lionfish present in the ecosystem increases the potential for
   cascading impacts throughout the food chain. Within the southeast region
   the combined effects of climate change, overfishing and invasive species
   may have irreversible consequences to native communities in this region.

AB As many crops are sensitive to changes in temperature and precipitation,
   agriculture is especially vulnerable to climate events. This may prove
   critical in tropical regions where most agriculture is in rain-fed
   systems and climate change may have a potentially large influence on
   productivity. By adversely affecting food and water resources, climate
   change thus threatens progress and efforts made in poverty reduction,
   economic growth, and achievement of further Millennium Development
   Goals, such as ending hunger on our planet and achieving environmental
   sustainability.
   The intensification of food production transformed formerly small-scale
   traditional systems to modern large-scale monocultures, e.g. in Latin
   America. However, banana monoculture production by smallholders is also
   found in many parts of the world, for example in countries such as St
   Lucia, which is a major banana-producing country in the Caribbean
   Windward Islands.
   Mono-cropping farmers increasingly need to deal with the fact that modem
   intensive agricultural systems which are characterized by increased need
   for fertilizers and irrigation, i.e. nutrients and water, may become
   more sensitive to climate change in tern-is of lower productivity,
   higher vulnerability, and reduced sustainability in the future.
   Moreover, food systems in developing countries are currently
   experiencing enormous organizational changes, reflected in the ongoing
   reorganization of supply chains, ranging from farm to fork. Being at the
   end of the chain, particularly the small-scale producers have to cope
   with global consumers' demands, reflected in the necessity to deliver
   high-quality products on time and at competitive prices. These high
   requirements can represent a serious barrier to small farmers'
   participation in higher value chains, e.g. in the Caribbean Island of St
   Lucia. St. Lucia's farmers therefore need to diversify their production,
   e.g. by adopting fair trade production standards, and tap new domestic
   as well as niche markets by means of improved commercialization to
   sustain food security and poverty reduction endeavors.
   Considering that small island developing states like St Lucia, where
   agriculture still represents the backbone of a society increasingly have
   to face these two global challenges - globalized markets and climate
   change - and recognize their impacts already today, this paper will
   explore the future impacts of climate change on the Caribbean region,
   discuss the potential impacts of climate change for smallholder
   agriculture in St Lucia, and elaborate on the importance of information,
   training and capacity building, not only in terms of improved
   diversification and commercialization of agricultural produce, but also
   for raising the adaptive capacity of small-scale farmers in St Lucia by
   providing sustainable adaptation options for farm-level diversification
   in the light of climate change.

AB Sustainability science suggests a core set of factors that foster
   significant change in governance, with leaders and entrepreneurs often
   identified as the main instigators. Discussions of leadership in
   governance transformations often focus on key charismatic people,
   underplaying contestation and the complex landscape of leadership. We
   present an empirical study that uses a participatory network mapping
   approach to provide a broader examination of leadership in integrated
   conservation and development. We use the Coral Triangle Initiative in
   Solomon Islands as an example of potential transformation in
   environmental governance across multiple objectives. Our analysis shows
   that actants, other than key individuals, enact leadership. We
   illustrate that a different suite of actants are providing leadership
   for each of the three Coral Triangle Initiative objectives. Actants can
   enact leadership by positively and negatively influencing different
   goals to varying extents. Our study illustrates the potential of broader
   and more nuanced understandings of leadership in environmental
   governance.

AB CARICOMFOODS was established in 1995 as the Regional Data Center for
   food composition activities in the English-speaking Caribbean. The
   geographical area represented by CARICOMFOODS covers 18 separate
   territories dispersed throughout the Caribbean basin with a total
   population of approximately six million. This report highlights three
   major activities undertaken during the period 2000-2002, as part of a
   planned 5-year development program aimed at creating an up-to-date
   nutrient database of foods commonly consumed in the region. An
   Organizational Structure for CARICOMFOODS has been developed and put
   into operation. Six peripheral country contact points, operating as
   national committees, feed information into the Caribbean Food and
   Nutrition Institute (CFNI) which acts as the Administrative arm of the
   Data Center. In an effort to improve skills in the generation and
   compilation of analytical data, a 3-week graduate training course on the
   Production and Use of Food Composition Data in Nutrition was conducted
   in Jamaica in 2001. In collaboration with FAO, CARICOMFOODS has
   initiated the development of a Foods Glossary, beginning with the fruit
   and vegetable category. The Glossary is aimed at improving food
   identification and will provide an image of the food along with
   country-specific names, scientific names, common uses and, ultimately,
   nutrient content. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The green mussel Perna viridis (Linnaeus 1758), a native of the
   Indo-Pacific, has been introduced to the Atlantic basin and Caribbean
   Sea. It was reported first in Cienfuegos Bay, Cuba, in 2005. This
   species has proliferated quickly and now constitutes an economic as well
   as ecological problem, interfering with the operations of a local
   thermoelectric plant. The objectives of this study were to document the
   spatial and temporal variation in P. viridis density across Cienfuegos
   Bay and to examine the relationship between P. viridis density and
   water-quality patterns within the bay. The presence and relative
   abundance of P. viridis were surveyed qualitatively in Cienfuegos Bay in
   January 2011. Four sites were selected for additional investigation, and
   mussel density was estimated 6 times during 2011 and 2012. Temperature,
   salinity, and dissolved oxygen also were measured. We found that P.
   viridis density differed across Cienfuegos Bay both temporally and
   spatially, and that, although salinity may play a role in green mussel
   distribution and density, other factors were also important. The
   greatest densities of P. viridis were located near the city of
   Cienfuegos on the northeastern shore of the bay. The results of our
   systematic sampling also revealed dramatic temporal variation in the
   Cienfuegos Bay P. viridis population. During the 22-mo study, green
   mussel density at two of the sampling sites declined by an order of
   magnitude. There are several possible explanations for the dramatic
   decline in P. viridis density during the sampling period. Among them are
   mortality resulting from stressful environmental conditions and removal
   through harvest, both coupled with low recruitment rates. The decline of
   the population in the bay suggests that this species is not a candidate
   for a commercial fishery and that manual harvest may be an efficient
   means of eradication, if desired.

AB Harmful algal blooms (HABs) constitute a worldwide problem, affecting
   aquatic ecosystems, public health and local economies. Supported by the
   International Atomic Energy Agency since 2009, Latin America and the
   Caribbean (LAC) countries, including Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Costa
   Rica, Cuba, Dominican Republic, El Salvador, Guatemala, Haiti, Mexico,
   Nicaragua, Panama, Uruguay and Venezuela, have integrated a regional
   network for early warning of HABs and biotoxins in seafood. Technical
   capacities have been developed at regional level to identify toxic
   species, evaluate biota toxicity, and to perform retrospective analysis
   of HAB occurrence. This network involves 58% of the coastal LAC
   countries, two regional reference centers (in El Salvador and Cuba), 14
   well equipped institutions, and 177 professionals trained to contribute
   to the operation of HAB and biotoxin monitoring programs. All countries
   from the network have reported planktonic and benthic toxic species, and
   in selected cases, associated with toxin in biota. Dinocyst abundance
   analysis in Pb-210-dated sediment cores have shown that some harmful
   species have been present in the region for at least 100 years ago, and
   that both coastal water pollution and climate change are important
   drivers for HAB occurrence. Efforts must be made to enrich the data base
   records on HAB events occurred in LAC, better understand key
   environmental variables that control HABs and expand coverage of HAB
   monitoring to all coastal countries in LAC to promote sustainable
   development of the region.

AB The Indo-Pacific red lionfish Pterois volitans is widespread both in its
   native and its non-native habitats. The rapid invasion of this top
   predator has had a marked negative effect on fish populations in the
   Western Atlantic and the Caribbean. It is now well documented that
   lionfish are invading many tropical and sub-tropical habitats. However,
   there are fewer data available on the change in lionfish abundance over
   time and the variation of body size and diet across habitats. A recent
   study in San Salvador, Bahamas, found body size differences between
   individuals from mangrove and reef systems. That study further suggested
   that ontogenetic investigation of habitat use patterns could help
   clarify whether lionfish are using the mangrove areas of San Salvador as
   nurseries. The aim of the present study is to determine temporal trends
   in lionfish relative abundance in mangrove and reef systems in San
   Salvador, and to further assess whether there is evidence suggesting an
   ontogenetic shift from mangroves to reef areas. Accordingly, we
   collected lionfish from mangrove and reef habitats and calculated catch
   per unit effort (a proxy for relative abundance), compared body size
   distributions across these two systems, and employed a combination of
   stable isotope, stomach content, and genetic analyses of prey, to
   evaluate differences in lionfish trophic interactions and habitat use
   patterns. Our results show that populations may have increased in San
   Salvador during the last 4 years, and that there is a strong similarity
   in body size between habitats, stark differences in prey items, and no
   apparent overlap in the use of habitat and/or food resources. These
   results suggest that there is not evidence an for ontogenetic shift from
   mangroves to reefs, and support other studies that propose lionfish are
   opportunistic forages with little movement across habitats.

   important to Croton taxonomy because several of the earliest described
   species were based on material from the island. The Jamaican species of
   Croton are found in five distinct clades indicating that there were at
   least five separate over-water dispersal events of the genus to the
   island. Croton jamaicensis (section Eluteria Griseb.), a new species
   endemic to limestone hills along the southern coast of Jamaica, is
   described and illustrated. The species is phylogenetically most closely
   related to C. laurinus Sw. and C. grisebachianus Mull. Arg., both also
   endemic to Jamaica. Several lectotypifications and novel synonymies are
   required to clarify the taxonomy of the species of Croton that have been
   described from Jamaica, some of which are widespread in the region.

AB Previous investigations of the guppy, Poecilia reticulata, in Trinidad
   have demonstrated rapid population differentiation at small geographic
   scales. However, most studies to date have focused on localities in
   Trinidad's Northern Range where barrier water falls mark sharp
   discontinuities in the selection regime and limit scope for gene now.
   There is little information on the ecology of the guppy in the rest of
   the island even though its distribution amongst fish communities and
   habitats has important evolutionary implications. To determine how
   large-scale distribution patterns might affect the evolutionary
   potential of the guppy we surveyed 80 sites representative of a broad
   range of freshwater environments. We found guppies, which occurred in
   80% of our samples, to be the most widely distributed freshwater fish in
   Trinidad. Guppies are common in predator-rich and turbid habitats,
   precisely those localities where female preferences are likely to be
   undermined. Moreover, the widespread distribution of this adaptable
   species, combined with its promiscuous mating system, may promote gene
   now across geographical scales that transcend local selection regimes.
   These factors are likely to impede the evolution of reproductive
   isolation. (C) 2001 The Linnean Society of London.

AB The International Census of Marine Microbes (ICoMM), together with the
   South American and Caribbean Steering Committees of the Census of Marine
   Life program (CoML), supported the initiative of launching a regional
   lCoMM node (LACar ICoMM). This network aims at promoting discussions
   among scientists currently involved in marine microbial studies carried
   out at both the South American and the Caribbean regions, in order to
   evaluate the research capabilities and to identify complementary
   strengths and/or possibilities for enhanced collaboration, that would
   improve the knowledge on marine microbes and their biodiversity in both
   regions. We present an overview and discussion on some of the directions
   of current research on marine microbes in these regions. Concerning the
   marine phytoplankton studies, the best known taxonomic groups are
   diatoms and dinoflagellates. In Mexican marine waters, the number of
   taxa recorded to date is of about 1400. Studies dealing with bacterial,
   phytoplankton and/or cyanobacterial dynamics are carried out in the
   Caribbean coastal and oceanic marine systems, underscoring the
   importance of various environmental states, modulated by geographic and
   seasonal patterns as well as by the expression of large South American
   rivers. One of the main issues of this type of survey is the
   determination of wet and dry seasonal patterns of bacterial dynamics, in
   seascapes off Puerto Rico, with moderate to absent river inputs.
   Phytoplankton and bacterioplankton dynamics are also studied in F.
   Guiana coastal and shelf systems under direct Amazon influence, well
   known for their important fisheries resources, as well as in other South
   American marine systems influenced by important fresh water inputs or
   under upwelling conditions. Bacterial and/or picoeukaryotes diversity
   are assessed in particular marine systems such as coastal lagoons in
   Uruguay, the Rio de la Plata estuary and adjacent areas, as well as in
   sediments of the Oxygen Minimum Zone (OMZ) off South American Pacific
   coast, and in anoxic waters of the Cariaco Basin. Findings of a diverse
   range of pico-autotrophs (Patagonian shelf) and particular communities
   of big filamentous bacteria (OMZ zone off the South American Pacific)
   represent recent discoveries in those areas. In polluted coastal
   systems, bacteria with ability to degrade pesticides and hydrocarbons
   are currently monitored. In coastal areas of the Colombian Caribbean, 64
   native marine bacterial strains were isolated from sediment samples. The
   oil-degrading bacteria are also studied in the Orinoco Delta, submitted
   to intensive oil exploitation. Furthermore, the Microbial Observatory of
   Rio de Janeiro (MoRio) established in Guanabara Bay (Brazil),
   constitutes a model for the study of threatened tropical coastal systems
   by exploring microbial biodiversity in different coastal systems
   (including unpolluted sites). The estimation of the activity and
   diversity of hydrocarbon and oil-degrading bacteria is assessed also in
   temperate waters and sediments of coastal systems of Argentina. Sharing
   knowledge and capabilities in common strategies would allow a better
   understanding of marine microbial diversity patterns in both regions.

PD JUN 30 2006
PY 2006
AB There is confusion about the comparative diversity of mollusks on
   opposite sides of the Isthmus of Panama due to inadequate sampling and
   contrasting patterns of diversity for different molluscan taxa. We
   report here on the occurrence of scallops (Bivalvia: Pectinidae) from
   extensive new dredge sample collections from the Gulf of Panama and Gulf
   of Chiriqui in the Eastern Pacific and from the San Blas archipelago to
   the Cochinos Cays in the Gulf of Honduras in the southwestern Caribbean.
   The collections contain more than 8000 specimens of 33 species from 213
   collections. These include 22 Caribbean species and 11 Eastern Pacific
   species. However, the average abundance of scallops per collection is
   much higher in the Eastern Pacific so that the average number of species
   per collection was similar in the two oceans. This discrepancy in
   abundance is the principal reason previous workers have erroneously
   concluded that species diversity is equal or even greater in the Eastern
   Pacific than the Caribbean. Numbers of scallop species at the seven
   different Caribbean localities sampled average about one and one half
   times higher than the two regions in the Eastern Pacific, and the total
   differences in species richness are two times higher for all the regions
   combined. Most scallop species were common to abundant and scallop
   species do not exhibit a log series or log normal pattern of relative
   abundance. However, we found eight previously undescribed species, two
   in the Eastern Pacific and six in the Caribbean. These appear to be
   geminate species and are indistinguishable, pending detailed
   morphological study, from species occurring in the opposite ocean. These
   new species are all rare but typically occurred in sufficient abundance
   and at numerous localities so that their occurrence is not in question.

AB The nudibranch genus Phyllidiopsis (Phyllidiidae) contains 30 currently
   recognized species, all of them distributed throughout the tropical
   Indo-Pacific, eastern Pacific, Northwest Atlantic and Caribbean Sea.
   Half of the known species of Phyllidiopsis inhabit deep waters, and most
   of the deep-sea species of the Phyllidiidae belong to this genus. There
   is no definitive explanation for the high diversity of Phyllidiopsis in
   the deep-sea or for whether diversity could be related to particular
   adaptations of this group or to historical events. In light of
   phylogenetic analysis, several cases of vicariance have been detected in
   this genus. Apparently two major vicariant events occurred between the
   tropical Indo-Pacific region and the Atlantic-eastern Pacific area first
   and subsequently between the eastern Pacific and the Atlantic. Vicariant
   events could also be involved in producing vertical distributional
   patterns in a few species of Phyllidiopsis. The scarcity of phyllidiids
   in the Atlantic Ocean may be explained by historical events, including
   isolation and subsequent extinction in shallow waters. There is a
   mimicry species complex in Phyllidiopsis, including several members of a
   clade that probably acquired this coloration through common ancestry,
   and also including another unrelated species that probably acquired this
   coloration through convergent or parallel evolution. There is also a
   group of white species, lacking any other contrasting colors, that
   inhabits deep waters. This coloration could constitute an adaptation to
   the deep-sea environment and not a mimicry complex. In this case, all
   species acquired this coloration through common ancestry.

AB Water, energy, and food are among the most important and fundamental
   resources for human beings and society. Despite the large potential for
   efficiency and reduction of losses, the demand for these resources is
   likely to increase due to population growth, changes in lifestyles,
   climate change, and other aspect of global change. The strong
   interconnectedness of these three vital resources has been termed the
   "Nexus" in the scientific literature in recent years. While many papers
   claim its fundamental importance, few provide specific ideas on how to
   deal with this Nexus in practice. This paper introduces twenty
   case-studies that are highlighted in this special issue that explore the
   practice of the Nexus and its scientific basis with particular focus on
   the Water-Energy-Food Nexus in the Asia-Pacific Region.

AB The origin of the terrestrial biota of Madagascar and, especially, the
   smaller island chains of the western Indian Ocean is relatively poorly
   understood. Madagascar represents a mixture of Gondwanan vicariant
   lineages and more recent colonizers arriving via Cenozoic dispersal,
   mostly from Africa. Dispersal must explain the biota of the smaller
   islands such as the Comoros and the chain of Mascarene islands, but
   relatively few studies have pinpointed the source of colonizers, which
   may include mainland Africa, Asia, Australasia, and Madagascar. The
   pantropical hermit spiders (genus Nephilengys) seem to have colonized
   the Indian Ocean island arc stretching from Comoros through Madagascar
   and onto Mascarenes, and thus offer one opportunity to reveal
   biogeographical patterns in the Indian Ocean. We test alternative
   hypotheses on the colonization route of Nephilengys spiders in the
   Indian Ocean and simultaneously test the current taxonomical hypothesis
   using genetic and morphological data. We used mitochondrial (COI) and
   nuclear (ITS2) markers to examine Nephilengys phylogenetic structure
   with samples from Africa, southeast Asia, and the Indian Ocean islands
   of Madagascar, Mayotte, Reunion and Mauritius. We used Bayesian and
   parsimony methods to reconstruct phylogenies and haplotype networks, and
   calculated genetic distances and fixation indices. Our results suggest
   an African origin of Madagascar Nephilengys via Cenozoic dispersal, and
   subsequent colonization of the Mascarene islands from Madagascar. We
   find strong evidence of gene flow across Madagascar and through the
   neighboring islands north of it, while phylogenetic trees, haplotype
   networks, and fixation indices all reveal genetically isolated and
   divergent lineages on Mauritius and Reunion, consistent with female
   color morphs. These results, and the discovery of the first males from
   Reunion and Mauritius, in turn falsify the existing taxonomic hypothesis
   of a single widespread species, Nephilengys borbonica, throughout the
   archipelago. Instead, we diagnose three Nephilengys species: Nephilengys
   livida (Vinson, 1863) from Madagascar and Comoros, N. borbonica (Vinson,
   1863) from Reunion, and Nephilengys dodo new species from Mauritius.
   Nephilengys followed a colonization route to Madagascar from Africa, and
   on through to the Mascarenes, where it speciated on isolated islands.
   The related golden orb-weaving spiders, genus Nephila, have followed the
   same colonization route, but Nephila shows shallower divergencies,
   implying recent colonization, or a moderate level of gene flow across
   the archipelago preventing speciation. Unlike their synanthropic
   congeners, N. borbonica and N. dodo are confined to pristine island
   forests and their discovery calls for evaluation of their conservation
   status. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB We used satellite telemetry to study behavior at foraging sites of 40
   adult female loggerhead sea turtles (Caretta caretta) from three Florida
   (USA) rookeries. Foraging sites were located in four countries (USA,
   Mexico, the Bahamas, and Cuba). We were able to determine home range for
   32 of the loggerheads. One turtle moved through several temporary
   residence areas, but the rest had a primary residence area in which they
   spent all or most of their time (usually > 11 months per year).
   Twenty-four had a primary residence area that was < 500 km(2) (mean =
   191). Seven had a primary residence area that was a parts per thousand
   yen500 km(2) (range = 573-1,907). Primary residence areas were mostly
   restricted to depths < 100 m. Loggerheads appeared to favor areas with
   larger-grained sediment (gravel and rock) over areas with
   smaller-grained sediment (mud). Short-term departures from primary
   residence areas were either looping excursions, typically involving 1-2
   weeks of continuous travel, or movement to a secondary residence area
   where turtles spent 25-45 days before returning to their primary
   residence area. Ten turtles had a secondary residence area, and six used
   it as an overwintering site. For those six turtles, the primary
   residence area was in shallow water (< 17 m) in the northern half of the
   Gulf of Mexico (GOM), and overwintering sites were farther offshore or
   farther south. We documented long winter dive times (> 4 h) for the
   first time in the GOM. Characterizing behaviors at foraging sites helps
   inform and assess loggerhead recovery efforts.

AB A new Trichinella species, Trichinella papuae, was discovered in 11.5%
   of wild pigs in a remote region of Papua New Guinea. A survey was
   conducted to determine whether the inhabitants of this region are
   infected with Trichinella, as wild-pig meat represents their main source
   of protein. The prevalence of anti-Trichinella antibodies and its
   determinants were assessed among the inhabitants in 51 of the villages
   in the Morehead District of Papua New Guinea. We tested and interviewed
   1536 people (28.8% of the adult population). Anti-Trichinella IgG were
   detected in 10.0% (95% Cl 8.5-11.6%) of them. The prevalence of
   seropositivity was higher in mates (12.7%) than in females (7.5%) (P <
   0.01), and the seroprevalence significantly increased with age. In one
   area, seroprevalence was highest in villages nearest the hunting area in
   which wild pigs are infected with Trichinella papuae (P < 0.01).
   Seropositivity was also correlated with the consumption of raw or
   undercooked meat. Persons reporting pain in the muscle joints and limbs
   were more likely to be seropositive; no severe clinical manifestations
   were observed. That infection was never severe suggests that the
   seropositive people are reinfected relatively often, but with very few
   larvae. If the epidemiological pattern of Trichinella infection observed
   among the hunting population of this area is any indication of the
   pattern of infection in prehistoric hunters, we can speculate that
   Trichinella infection due to the consumption of meat from wild animals
   was possibly a common disease among prehistoric populations. (c) 2005

AB Background and Objectives: Malnutrition is a public health problem
   especially among the Pacific Small Island developing nations. This study
   assessed malnutrition with dietary intakes in households of South
   Tarawa, Kiribati, a West Pacific Island Nation State. Methods and Study
   Design: A cross-sectional community-based study design was used. One
   hundred and sixty-one households were selected from Betio, Bikenibeu and
   Teaorereke towns using a systematic random sampling method. About 35%
   each of the households was selected from Bikenebue and Besio while 30.4%
   was selected from Teaoraeke. Family (including children) dietary surveys
   including 24-hour dietary recall were administered to assess adequacy of
   nutrient intakes and dietary diversity using House-hold Diet Diversity
   Scores. A 3-day weighed food record was collected on a sub-sample. Data
   were analysed using FoodWorks Pro 8 for nutrient intake and Statistical
   Product for Service Solution (SPSS) version 21 for descriptive
   statistics. Results: Sixty-one percent of the subjects had the lowest
   dietary diversity, 36.3% had a medium dietary diversity and only 2.7%
   had the highest dietary diversity. Based on the weighed food record
   results (n=29), male subjects of all age groups had adequate intakes of
   riboflavin, niacin, vitamin C, magnesium, iron and zinc, but had high
   intakes of protein and sodium; and low intakes of potassium and calcium.
   Female subjects had adequate intakes of vitamin C, iron, magnesium and
   zinc, but had high intakes of protein and sodium; and low intakes of
   potassium and calcium. Conclusions: Across all groups, 61% of the adult
   Kiribati population studied showed low dietary diversity, and a high
   prevalence of multiple micronutrient deficiencies.

AB Molluscan faunal turnover in the Plio-Pleistocene of the tropical
   western Atlantic has been attributed to drops in temperature or primary
   productivity, but these competing hypotheses have not been assessed
   ecologically. To test these alternatives, we compiled data on changing
   molluscan life habits and trophic composition over 12 million years
   derived from 463 newly made collections from the southwestern Caribbean.
   Shelf ecosystems have altered markedly in trophic structure since the
   Late Pliocene. Predatory gastropods and suspension-feeding bivalves
   declined significantly in abundance, but not in diversity, and
   reef-dwellers became common. By contrast, all other ecological life
   habits remained remarkably stable. Food-web changes strongly support the
   hypothesis that declining regional nutrient supply had an increasing
   impact on regional macroecology, culminating in a faunal turnover.

AB Recent geographical discussions of postcolonialism have highlighted its
   emphasis on texts and discourses, its neglect of more material aspects
   of (post)imperial/colonial domination and the need for detailed
   empirical research articulating postcolonialism and global capitalism.
   This paper addresses these issues by reporting on research based in a
   recent debate in the UK trade press over the 'failure' of Caribbean food
   to 'cross over' into the UK 'mainstream'. It outlines the contrasting
   manufacturing and marketing practices of two Jamaican food companies
   whose accounts of (not) attempting this 'cross-over' illustrate
   postcolonialism's hybrid, resistant, ambivalent, scale-jumping,
   boundary-crossing, material cultural politics.

AB The queen conch Strombus gigas is a large, commercially important
   gastropod mollusc native to the Caribbean region that has become
   severely depleted because of overfishing and habitat destruction. Over
   the last 10 yr attempts have been made to rehabilitate conch stocks
   through releases of hatchery-reared stocks, but successes have been few.
   Some of the reasons for high mortality in hatchery-reared conch are
   elucidated by recent experiments conducted at Lee Stocking Island in the
   central Bahamas. Field experiments with juvenile queen conch indicate
   that sites with similar depths, sediments, and macrophyte cover do not
   provide equivalent food and shelter for conch. Transplants of conch were
   successful only in sites known to fit historically significant as
   nursery grounds. While small scale transplants can be used to screen
   potential outplant sites, only comprehensive understanding of the
   habitat requirements, behavior, feeding ecology, and predator-prey
   relationships will lead to long-term enhancement of fishery stocks.
   Differences in morphology, behavior, and habitat utilization between
   wild and hatchery-reared stocks also had significant effects on the
   survivorship and growth of outplanted stock. Therefore, hatcheries must
   develop culture methods that do not reduce the natural fitness of wild
   stock. Successful enhancement of natural fisheries through outplanting
   of hatchery-reared stocks depends upon: to development of hatchery
   animals sufficiently well adapted to survive in the field; and 2)
   release of the stock in suitable habitats at the optimal time. Close
   linkage between laboratory and field research. and hatchery operators
   will be necessary for the ultimate success of stock enhancement efforts.

AB Understanding the factors that determine habitat use and abundance of
   exploited species is essential to develop effective conservation
   strategies. We studied the four forest pigeons on Sao Tome Island to
   assess the species' distribution and abundance patterns. We determined
   ecological factors likely to be associated with each species' use of
   habitats and numbers, as well as the influence of hunting pressure. In
   total, 35 km of line transects were surveyed in the rainy season and at
   the start of the dry season. Pigeons differed in their use of habitats;
   there were also strong seasonality effects. The most abundant species
   was the Lemon Dove Columba simplex, the only non-hunted species. The Sao
   Tome Green Pigeon Treron sanctithomae and Maroon Pigeon Columba
   thomensis were less abundant and had more restricted ranges. Both
   species were strongly associated with old-growth forests. In contrast,
   the Bronze-naped Pigeon Columba malherbii was relatively abundant and
   widespread; this species favours human-altered habitats such as shade
   forests and non-forested areas. Fruit availability measured within the
   different habitats was linked with the distribution and abundance of the
   three hunted species. Potential human predation pressure on all species
   was determined from hunting signs found along the surveyed transects.
   There was a significant negative correlation between the abundance of
   two of the hunted species and hunting pressure. Our results indicate the
   importance of adequately protecting old-growth and secondary forests as
   core habitats for the survival of viable populations of all pigeon
   species in the island. However, control of hunting is also crucial.

AB This study aimed to gain insight on patterns of spatial variability of
   seagrass epiphytes of both leaves and of rhizomes in three different
   habitats, continental coasts, offshore banks and islands. Moreover, we
   tried to discriminate between habitat-dependant variability and
   scale-dependant variability of Posidonia oceanica epiphytic assemblages.
   Results showed the absence of significant differences in the structure
   of assemblages of epiphytes both on leaves and on rhizomes among
   continental coasts, offshore banks and islands, even if the patterns of
   spatial variability changed among habitats. In fact, although a high
   variability at small scales appeared a constant pattern in epiphytic
   assemblages, large-scale variability resulted higher in continental
   coasts and offshore banks than in islands. In conclusion, epiphytic
   assemblages of Posidonia oceanica appear homogeneous among habitats,
   showing a similar structure and species composition in the same
   geographic area. On the contrary, differences between meadows appeared
   linked to local differences in environmental factors that are more
   evident in habitats influenced by human disturbance.

   description, and dubious type locality confound the problem. Recently an
   extant series of nine museum specimen from Belem, state of Para, Brazil
   were selected as topotypes for Epictia albifrons Wagler. From this
   series a neotype was designated. Here we compare the morphology of the
   neotype to specimens from Trinidad and Guyana, confirming that they are
   Epictia tenella (Klauber) not E. albifrons (Wagler). We also compare
   four mitochondrial and one nuclear marker from Trinidad and mainland
   (Guyana) Epictia tenella populations and find E. tenella relatively
   widespread with minimal genetic diversification between island and
   mainland specimens. Hypotheses that may explain the low divergence for
   this small, fossorial snake are explored and discussed: over-water
   rafting, human-mediated dispersal, and avian-mediated dispersal.

AB This is Part II of a two-part review about climate and climate
   variability focused on the Eastern Tropical Pacific (ETP) and the
   Caribbean Sea (CS). Both parts are aimed at providing oceanographers,
   marine biologists, and other ocean scientists, a guiding base for
   ocean-atmosphere interaction processes affecting the CS, the ETP, and
   the waters of Isla del Coco. Isla del Coco National Park is a Costa
   Rican World Heritage site. Part I analyzed the mean fields for both
   basins and a larger region covering 25 degrees S - 35 degrees N, 20
   degrees W - 130 degrees W. Here we focus on a smaller area (65 degrees W
   - 95 degrees W, 0 degrees - 20 degrees N), as a complement to Part 1.
   Incoming solar radiation and surface energy fluxes reveal the complex
   nature of the ETP and CS for convective activity and precipitation on
   seasonal and intraseasonal time scales. Both regions are relevant as
   sources of evaporation and the associated moisture transport processes.
   The American Monsoon System influences the climate and climate
   variability of the ETP and CS, however, the precise way systems affect
   regional precipitation and transport of moisture, within the Intra
   Americas Sea (IAS) are not clear. Although the Caribbean Low-Level Jet
   (CLLJ) is known to act as a conveyor belt for moisture transport,
   intraseasonal and seasonal modes of the CLLJ and their interactions with
   other IAS systems, have to be further investigated. Trans-isthmic jets,
   exert a variable seasonal wind stress force over the ocean surface
   co-generating regions of great marine productivity. Isolated convection,
   the seasonal migration of the Intertropical Convergence Zone, the
   hurricane season, the Mid-Summer Drought, the seasonal and intraseasonal
   behavior of low-level jets and their interactions with transients, and
   the southward incursion of cold fronts contribute to regional seasonal
   precipitation. Many large-scale systems, such as El Nino-Southern
   Oscillation, the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation and the Madden-Julian
   Oscillation (MJO, also influence the variability of precipitation by
   modulating regional features associated with convection and
   precipitation. Monthly tropical storm (TS) activity in the CS and ETP
   basins is restricted to the period May-November, with very few cases in
   December. The CS presents TS peak activity during August, as well as for
   the number of hurricanes and major hurricanes, in contrast to the ETP
   that shows the same features during September. Rev. Biol. Trop. 64

AB CTD, vessel-mounted ADCP and LADCP measurements in the Caribbean
   passages south of Guadeloupe (three repeats) and along 16 degrees N
   (five repeats) were carried out between December 2000 and July 2004. The
   CTD data were used to calculate the contribution of South Atlantic water
   (SAW) in the upper 1200 m between the isopycnals sigma(0) = 24.5 and
   27.6. Northern and southern source water masses are defined and an
   isopycnal mixing approach is applied. The SAW fractions are then
   combined with the ADCP flow field to calculate the transport of SAW into
   the Caribbean and across 16 degrees N. The SAW inflow into the Caribbean
   through the passages south of Guadeloupe ranges from 7.6 to 11.6 Sv,
   which is 50-75% of the total inflow. The mean (9.1 +/- 2.2 Sv) is in the
   range of previous estimates. Ambiguities in the northern and southern
   source water masses of the salinity maximum water permitted us only to
   calculate the contribution of SAW from the eastern source in this water
   mass. We estimated the additional SAW transport by the western source to
   be of the order of 1.9 +/- 0.7 Sv. The calculation of the SAW transport
   across 16 degrees N was hampered by the presence of several anticyclonic
   rings from the North Brazil Current (NBC) retroflection region, some of
   the rings were subsurface intensified. Provided that the rings observed
   at 16 degrees N are typical rings and that all rings which are annually
   produced in the NBC retroflection area (6.5-8.5 per year) reach 16
   degrees N, the SAW ring transport across 16 degrees N is calculated to
   5.3 +/- 0.7 Sv. From the 5 repeats at 16 degrees N, only two showed a
   net northward flow, suggesting that the mean northward SAW transport is
   dominated by ring advection. The joint SAW transports of the Caribbean
   inflow (9.1 Sv) and the flow across 16 degrees N (5.3 Sv) sum up to 14.4
   Sv. The transport increases to 16.3 Sv if the additional SAW transport
   from the western source of SMW (1.9 +/- 0.7 Sv) is included. These
   transport estimates and the following implications depend strongly on
   the assumption that the surface water in the Caribbean inflow is of
   South Atlantic origin. The transport estimates are, however, in the
   range of the inverse model calculations for the net cross-hemispheric
   flow. About 30-40% of this transport is intermediate water from the
   South Atlantic, presumably supporting studies which found the
   contributions of intermediate and upper warm water to be of a comparable
   magnitude. For the upper warm water (sigma(0) < 27.1), the Caribbean
   inflow seems to be the major path (7.9 +/- 1.6 Sv), the ring induced
   transport across 16 degrees N is about 30% of that value. The
   intermediate water transport across 16 degrees N was calculated to be
   2.3-3.6 Sv, the inflow into the Caribbean is slightly smaller (1.5-2.4
   Sv). (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Sao Tome and Principe is an archipelago located in the Gulf of Guinea.
   This archipelago seems to be an important area for cetaceans, probably
   due to large concentrations of prey, as well as the existence Of several
   small bays and shallow water that constitute preferred rest areas. In
   comparison to other areas of the world, little is known about cetacean
   communities in this archipelago. Boat-based surveys to record sightings
   of cetaceans were conducted between 2002 and 2005, which represents the
   first approach to study the occurrence of whales and dolphins in this
   tropical region. Sightings of humpback whales (Megaptera novaeangliae),
   bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus), pantropical spotted dolphins
   (Stenella attenuata), killer whales (Orcinus orca), sperm whales
   (Physeter macrocephalus) and pilot whales (Globicephala melas) were
   recorded. Cetaceans were found throughout a range of sea surface
   temperature between 24 and 29 degrees C and a wide range of depths.
   Significant differences were found regarding the occurrence of some
   species. Humpback whales showed a preference for shallower waters
   between 20 and 100 m, Bottlenose dolphins occurred most commonly along
   the continental shed (20 to 100 m) and pantropical spotted dolphins

AB Split S waves observed at Hockley, Texas from events in the Tonga-Fiji
   region of the southwest Pacific show predominantly vertically polarized
   shear-wave (SV) energy arriving earlier than horizontally polarized (SH)
   energy for rays propagating horizontally through D ". After corrections
   are made for the effects of upper-mantle anisotropy beneath Hockley, a
   time lag of 1.5 to 2.0 s remains for the furthest events (93.9
   degrees-100.6 degrees), while the time lags of the nearer observations
   (90.5 degrees-92.9 degrees) nearly disappear. At closer distances, the S
   waves from these same events do not penetrate as deeply into the lower
   mantle, and are not split. These observations suggest that a patch of D
   " beneath the central Pacific is anisotropic, while the mantle
   immediately above the patch is isotropic. The thickness of the
   anisotropic zone appears to be of the order of 100-200 km.
   Observations of shear-wave splitting have previously been made for paths
   that traverse D " under the Caribbean and under Alaska. SH leads SV, the
   reverse of the Hockley observations, but in these areas the fact that SV
   leads SH in the HKT data shown here suggests a different sort of
   anisotropy under the central Pacific from that under Alaska and the
   Caribbean. The case of SH travelling faster than SV is consistent with
   transverse isotropy with a vertical axis of symmetry (VTI) and does not
   require variations with azimuth. The case of SV leading Sri is
   consistent with transverse isotropy with a horizontal axis of symmetry
   (HTI), an azimuthally anisotropic medium, and with a VTI medium formed
   by a hexagonal crystal. Given that (Mg,Fe)SiO(3) perovskite appears
   unlikely to form anisotropic fabrics on a large scale, the presence of
   anisotropy may point to chemical heterogeneity in the lowermost mantle,
   possibly due to mantle-core interactions.

AB Aim The subspecies of Paradisaeidae are mapped and the distribution
   patterns correlated with aspects of New Guinea tectonics.
   Location New Guinea, the northern Moluccas, and north-eastern Australia.
   Methods Panbiogeographical analysis (Craw et al., 1999).
   Results Pteridophora, Loboparadisaea, Parotia carolae and others are
   notably absent from the Vogelkop, Huon and Papuan Peninsulas, accreted
   terranes in the north and cast of New Guinea. Coupled with this,
   putative sister taxa in each of Astrapia, Parotia and Paradisaea show
   massively disjunct affinities between the Vogelkop and Huon Peninsulas:
   Astrapia nigra (Vogelkop) and A. rothschildi (Huon Peninsula); Parotia
   sefilata (Vogelkop) and P. wahnesi (Huon); and Paradisaea rubra (Western
   Papuan Islands by the Vogelkop) and P. guilielmi (Huon Peninsula). In
   the last two species the males have oil-green throat coloration
   extending above the eye to cover the front of the crown, the eye is
   reddish-brown not yellow, the rectrices are longer and the inner vane of
   the outermost primaries is not emarginate.
   Main conclusions The disjunct affinities among the accreted terranes
   (Vogelkop, Huon, etc.), together with the absences there of groups like
   Pteridophora, are incompatible with usual dispersal models of New Guinea
   biogeography, but are compatible with recent analyses of vicariance
   biogeography and terrane tectonics (Michaux, 1994; Flannery, 1995; de
   Boer & Duffels, 1996a, b; Polhemus, 1996; Polhemus & Polhemus, 1998).
   Birds of paradise are sedentary forest dwellers with small home ranges
   and are tolerant of disturbance, and so it is suggested that populations
   have been caught in the dramatic geological movements (lateral and
   vertical) of different parts of New Guinea and this has led to
   fragmentation and juxtaposition of ranges, as well as altitudinal
   anomalies.

   and a mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) marker. There was little variation among
   Central American populations and weak isolation by distance was only
   observed with the MS loci. There was moderate to large variation between
   Central and South American populations, suggesting a barrier to gene
   flow between Central and South America. However, Panamanian and Pacific
   Costa Rican populations differed with respect to western Central
   America, suggesting that there may be another barrier within Central
   America. There was small to moderate variation among Caribbean and
   continental populations. Phylogenctic and diversity analyses of mtDNA
   indicate that more ancestral and diverse haplotypes were present in the
   Caribbean population, suggesting that current continental An. albimanus
   populations may have originated from the Caribbean.

AB High islands, with potentially greater habitat diversity, are expected
   to have greater species richness and diversity compared to low islands,
   typically atolls and coral islands of lower habitat diversity, within
   the same geographical area. Patterns of species similarity, richness,
   and diversity were compared among coral reef fishes between the low
   island of the Southwest Palau Islands (SWPI), and the low and high
   islands of the Main Palauan Archipelago (MPA). Data from diurnal visual
   transects accounted for approximately 64% and 69% of the shorefish
   faunas known from the SWPI and MPA, respectively. Two distinct fish
   faunas were representative of low and high islands. The first was
   confined to the coral islands of the SWPI. The second was partitioned
   into both low and high islands of the MPA, and Helen Reef, a large atoll
   in the SWPI. The second type was clustered into atolls, low islands with
   atoll-like barrier reef systems, a coral island, and three high island
   systems, one with an extensive barrier reef system. Contrary to the
   prediction that high islands, with relatively greater habitat diversity,
   would have greater species richness and diversity, species richness and
   diversity were greatest at Kossol, a large atoll-like 'low island'
   locality at the northern end of a high island in the MPA, followed by
   two atolls, Kayangel (MPA, north of Kossol) and Helen Reef. In contrast,
   species richness and diversity were lower at high island localities and
   lowest at small coral islands. These results suggest that habitat
   diversity for reef fishes increases as a function of increasing area
   regardless of whether the locality is a high or low island.

AB Sacoglossan sea slugs feed by suctorially consuming siphonaceous green
   algae. Most sacoglossan species are feeding specialists, but the
   Caribbean coral reef-dwelling Elysia crispata is polyphagous and
   sequesters chloroplasts from multiple algal species into cells lining
   its digestive diverticulum for use in photosynthesis. We have used
   sequences of the chloroplast-encoded rbcL gene to compare the
   chloroplast donor algae in five populations of E. crispata from various
   Caribbean locations. We found that E. crispata utilizes more algal
   species than was previously known, including some algae previously not
   reported as present in the region. In addition, slugs from each location
   had unique chloroplast arrays with little overlap, except that all
   locations had slugs feeding on algae within the genus Bryopsis. This
   variation in diet between locations suggests that the slugs may be
   exhibiting local adaptation in their dietary choices, and it highlights
   ecological differences between the Caribbean-wide reef-dwelling ecotypes
   and the mangrove lagoon ecotypes found in the Florida Keys.

AB Ramicrusta textilis sp. nov. (Peyssonneliaceae, Gigartinales) is
   described from shallow, nearshore waters of Jamaica (Caribbean Sea). The
   reddish-gold to brown thalli grow on bedrock and dead coral heads, but
   they may also overgrow living corals. Thallus morphology is highly
   variable; a single confluent thallus may include smooth, prostrate
   crustose portions, overlapping foliose lobes, curtainlike erect lobes,
   and apically flaring columns. Tabular basal cells in parallel Filaments
   support downgrowing, unicellular rhizoids on the ventral surface and
   branching assurgent filaments toward the dorsal surface. Extensive
   formation of secondary pit connections among lower cells of the
   assurgent filaments join cells of adjacent Filaments along a horizontal
   axis that is oblique to that of each subtending layer, resulting in a
   pseudoparenchymatous construction that is highly patterned and tightly
   integrated. The outer cortex contains large cells associated with raised
   rims on the thallus surface, and these cells are interpreted as hair
   cell initials. Calcification is extensive, and the structure of the
   mineral skeleton, exposed by removal of orgarlic material, is described
   by scanning electron microscopy. Peyssonnelia calcea and Ramicrusta
   nanhaiensis, both known only from the Indo-Pacific Ocean, are the only
   other peyssonnelioid species whose vegetative anatomy involves secondary
   pit connections or cell fusions, and their relationship to R. textilis
   is considered. Molecular analyses also indicate a relationship with R.
   nanhaiensis and support assignment of this new species to the genus
   Ramicrusta.

AB Rainwater harvesting (RWH), which was previously undertaken more out of
   necessity than any commitment to autonomy, is now being heralded as a
   sustainable alternative for domestic water supply and flood control, and
   in disaster relief. In Trinidad and Tobago and the wider Caribbean
   region, RWH is included in water security and sustainability strategies.
   Despite the plethora of domestic RWH projects, estimates of water
   consumption in RWH-dependent households are unavailable, and project
   designers are left to assume values that are based on conventional
   water-supply systems. In the present study the per capita consumption
   (PCC) of domestic water in three RWH-dependent communities was
   quantified. For this purpose, households' perceived and actual water
   consumption was investigated in three rural communities in Trinidad. It
   was found that perceived and actual consumption are 105-164 l per person
   per day (lpd) and 95-240 lpd, respectively. Householders' perception of
   how much water is consumed was generally significantly different from
   the measured amount. While the sample of measured PCC was small, the
   results provide more realistic values for the design of RWH systems,
   which are being promoted in the region.

AB The purpose of this study is to develop a methodology that allows for an
   estimate of the hydroclimatic influence on an inland pond system on San
   Salvador, Bahamas. The methodology utilizes the Hydrologic Landscape
   Unit (HLU) model, a new conceptual model that offers hydrologists and
   water-resource managers more flexibility in representing the components
   of the unique and complex hydrologic systems of small carbonate islands.
   For this case study, a linear regression model was developed to
   empirically assess the HLU. This analysis separates tidal and climatic
   impacts on water levels of the pond and indicates that astronomical
   tides dominate, explaining 65% of the variance in pond water-level
   observations. Further, clusters of days with positive and negative
   outliers identified in the linear regression analysis were compared to
   precipitation events to determine response of water levels to climatic
   inputs. More than 78% of the days with positive outliers were associated
   with precipitation events and 83% of the days with negative outliers in
   Crescent Pond were explained by a lack of precipitation, signifying
   cumulative evaporation effects. Thus, while tidal variation is the
   principle forcing mechanism for Crescent Pond water-level variability,
   significant interaction between the atmosphere and the pond surface can
   be identified with this methodology at the daily to weekly time scale.
   Such a tool can be used by hydrologists and water-resource managers on
   small carbonate islands to assess the degree of freshwater input into
   inland water bodies and the appropriate time scale for potential
   freshwater harvest.

   collaborative actions between parties, as well as, opportunity to
   actualize food cross-border trading between local farmers and factories.
   For the result, there are two approaches will be applied. First, the
   empowerment term refers to the strategy of empowerment in strengthening
   the capability and capacity of human capital as one of the determinant
   factors of the resilience and self-sufficiency achievement. Second, the
   gender approach looks at the women and men build confidence, resilience,
   and independence which one of them through an educational intervention
   that enable the local people to manage food chain. Atambua is a region
   count as relatively as high poverty, poor human capital, weak quality
   and competitiveness of agriculture products, livestock and fishery,
   SMEs, and infrastructure. Thus, field study research is applied to find
   the actual and strategic effort aim to lead the achievement of food
   security and to engage Atambua over food trade to Timor Leste.

AB This article focuses on developing a sustainable tourism in small
   Caribbean islands, defined here as those that have populations of fewer
   than 500,000. Such islands share a very fragile ecology and a high
   dependence on tourism. They differ in their degree of tourist
   penetration and visitor density and the related degree of environmental
   degradation.
   To explain the link between tourism intensity and ecological
   vulnerability, the so-called "destination life-cycle model" is
   presented. This suggests that islands pass through three primary stages
   of tourist development: low-density exploration, rapid growth and
   consolidation, and high-density maturation involving the substitution of
   man-made for natural attractions.
   A broad empirical test of the model is performed through a quantitative
   examination of the tourism characteristics and visitor densities of a
   cross section of 23 small Caribbean islands. The three basic stages or
   tourism styles are identified: low-impact emerging areas, high-density
   mass-market mature destinations, and rapidly growing intermediate
   islands in between. Some broad strategies consistent with the systems
   framework for a sustainable tourism with moderate densities are briefly
   explored.

AB Deep-water coral habitats off the southeastern USA (SEUS) support
   diverse fish and invertebrate assemblages, but are poorly explored. This
   study is the first to report on the hydroids collected from these
   habitats in this area. Thirty-five species, including two species that
   are likely new to science, were identified from samples collected
   primarily by manned submersible during 2001-2005 from deep-water coral
   habitats off North Carolina to east-central Florida. Eleven of the
   species had not been reported since the 19th to mid-20th century. Ten
   species, and one family, the Rosalindidae, are documented for the first
   time in the SEUS. Latitudinal ranges of 15 species are extended, and the
   deepest records in the western North Atlantic for 10 species are
   reported. A species accumulation curve illustrated that we continue to
   add to our knowledge of hydroid diversity in these habitats. Sexually
   mature individuals were collected for 19 species during the summer to
   early autumn months. Most of the observed species (89%) liberate planula
   larvae as part of their life cycles, suggesting that these species
   exhibit a reproductive strategy that reduces the risk of dispersal to
   suboptimal habitats. Hydroids occurred across various substrata
   including coral rubble, live corals, rock and other animal hosts
   including hydroids themselves. All observed species were regionally
   widespread with typically deep-neritic to bathyal sub-tropical/tropical
   distributions. Hydroid assemblages from deep-water SEUS coral habitats
   were most similar to those from adjacent deep-water habitats off the
   SEUS (17 shared species), and those in the Straits of Florida/Bahamas
   and Caribbean/West Indian regions (14 and 8 shared species,
   respectively). The similarity to sub-tropical and tropical assemblages
   and the richness of plumularioids in the SEUS deep-water coral habitats
   support the idea of a Pleistocene intrusion of tropical species
   northwards following an intensification of the Gulf Stream from the
   Caribbean. (c) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

BP 341

PD 2015
PY 2015
AB The development of a food processing and preservation industry was
   identified by the Papua New Guinea (PNG) government as one of the
   priority programs in the National Agricultural Development Plan
   2007-2016. Food processing using local materials was envisaged to have
   the potential to generate employment and income opportunities for
   smallholder farmers, and hence contributing to poverty reduction and
   food security. The PNG food manufacturing sector is small, and is
   dominated by foreign companies using primarily imported ingredients. The
   objective of this study was to assess the challenges and opportunities
   for developing a locally-owned food processing sector in PNG, using
   sweetpotato as a test case.
   Sweetpotato was chosen because it is the main staple crop in PNG and is
   grown by smallholder farmers across the country all year round.
   Consequently, the socio-economic impact could be significant if an
   efficient sweetpotato processing sector could be established. The impact
   could be even greater if the associated technology spilled over to other
   food crops (cassava, yam and taro) and South Pacific countries. Research
   methods used included: technical trials to improve sweetpotato flour
   processing efficiency and flour quality; sweetpotato product
   development; and a review of sweetpotato processing R& D in PNG.
   Results showed that, although there is a niche market for sweetpotato
   products, sweetpotato flour, as a raw material for commercial food
   processing, is not versatile functionally or cost competitive, compared
   with wheat and corn (for flour production), potato (for fries/ chips),
   and cassava (for starch). Limited R& D resources can be better spent on
   improving the value chain of fresh sweetpotato roots. However, if the
   PNG government is determined to develop a food processing industry,
   sweetpotato processing can be used as a pilot both to build research and
   development capacity in food processing, and to develop an enabling
   environment necessary for small to medium size agroenterprise
   development.

   pharmaceuticals were detected at ng/L concentrations. Among drugs of
   abuse, benzoylecgonine (i.e. metabolite of cocaine), MDMA (i.e. Ecstasy)
   and MDA (i.e. 3,4-methylenedioxyamphetamine) were present at the highest

AB Timor-Leste fishers use simple fishing techniques, boats and equipment,
   and the fishery sector presents a unique opportunity to promote an
   environmentally sustainable pattern of fishery resource management.
   Timor-Leste has one of the highest rates of chronic malnutrition in the
   world, and fish could provide the needed protein, vitamins, and
   micronutrients. Here, I describe the models of production, distribution,
   and marketing of fish, and the consumption patterns of animal proteins.
   I discuss how ritual meat exchanges and marketing constraints influence
   the current economic strategies of fishing households. As a result, I
   suggest that in order to animate the sector, development policy should
   promote domestic fish consumption instead of general production along
   with investment and management of ice distribution systems.

   broadly rounded vinculum, spiny juxta, and slender apical processes of
   the aedeagus, and in its host plant. The external features and male
   genitalia of Tischeria gouaniae sp. n. are figured and described. A

   species from North and South America are given. Most American species
   are known from USA, but others are now known from tropical forest

AB Timor Leste is a new country of the 21st century in Southeast Asia that
   has a diverse culture. Tais Timor Leste has a high historical value as
   well as cultural identity. It is also one of the cultural heritages of
   Timor Leste. Tais Timor has its own characteristics and meanings in
   every motif, but there are still many communities of Timor Leste as well
   as foreign tourists who do not know the variety of the motif. Therefore,
   this study aimed to establish the system recognition of Tais Timor motif
   through the image based on the type of motif. The wavelet transform is
   used in the process of feature extraction and image decomposition to
   obtain coefficient values of which the value of energy and entropy will
   then be calculated. For the recognition of Tais Timor motif,
   backpropagation algorithm was used. This application is built using
   MATLAB programming language. The analysis and testing of these studies
   show that the accuracy of recognition of Tais Timor motif with 4 testing
   parameters got recognition accuracy and presentation of 80%. Thus the
   motif used can be identified by using both wavelet transform and
   backpropagation algorithm.

AB Culex (Melanoconion) panocossa is a suspected vector of Venezuelan
   equine encephalitis virus in Central America. Prior to this report, Cx.
   panocossa was known from Central America (Belize, Costa Rica, El
   Salvador, Guatemala, southern Mexico, Panama), northern South America
   (Colombia, Venezuela) and the Greater Antilles (Cuba and Jamaica).
   Larvae (n=5) and adults (n=4286) of Cx. panocossa were collected at two
   locations near Homestead, FL, which indicates substantial established
   populations of this probable vector species in the continental US. Since
   larvae of Cx. panocossa are associated with Pistia app. (water lettuce),
   the distribution of this mosquito is likely to expand in Florida, where
   water lettuce is a major invasive plant in freshwater ecosystems. The
   putative establishment of Cx. panocossa in Florida is of significant
   concern from a public health perspective, as its proliferation in
   developed areas could link historically sylvatic transmission foci of
   Everglades virus with populated centers such as the greater Miami
   Metropolitan area. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB A revised calibration is presented relating the oxygen isotope

   nicholsoni, oxygen isotope composition of seawater, and ambient water

   high-resolution delta O-18 data measured in sclerosponges from the
   Bahamas and Jamaica compared to ambient temperature measurements and
   delta O-18 values of seawater from the two locations, both measured and
   published. New data improve an existing calibration which was determined
   using measurements of salinity rather than directly measured delta O-18
   values of the seawater and was composed of measurements from different
   species of sclerosponge and other aragonite-secreting organisms. The
   updated calibration (n = 12, r(2) = 0.95) is:
   T(degrees C) = 16.1(+/- 3.1) - [6.5(+/- 1.1)](delta(arag) - delta(sw)),
   where T is temperature in degrees Celsius, delta(arag) is the delta O-18
   value of aragonite normalized to VPDB, and delta(sw) is the delta O-18
   value of water normalized to VSMOW. This calibration improves accuracy
   and precision of Caribbean sclerosponges for reconstructions of
   temperature as well as delta O-18 values of seawater. (C) 2009 Elsevier

AB The introduction and subsequent spread of lionfish into the Atlantic
   Ocean and Caribbean Sea has become a worldwide conservation issue. These
   highly successful invaders may also be capable of introducing non-native
   microorganisms to the invaded regions. This study compared the bacterial
   communities associated with lionfish external tissue to those of native
   Bahamian fishes and ambient water. Terminal restriction fragment length
   polymorphism analyses demonstrated that lionfish bacterial communities
   were significantly different than those associated with three native
   Bahamian fishes. Additionally, all fishes harbored distinct bacterial
   communities from the ambient bacterioplankton. Analysis of bacterial
   clone libraries from invasive lionfish and native squirrelfish indicated
   that lionfish communities were more diverse than those associated with
   squirrelfish, yet did not contain known fish pathogens. Using microscopy

   Eggs removed from the ovaries of gravid females were free of bacteria,
   suggesting that lionfish likely acquire bacteria from the environment.
   This study was the first examination of bacterial communities associated
   with the invasive lionfish and indicated that they support different
   communities of environmentally derived bacteria than Caribbean reef

AB A review of species of the genus Parapontophilus Christoffersen, 1988
   (Decapoda, Caridea, Crangonidae) from the world oceans is presented.
   This Study is based on the large collection obtained during French
   expeditions in the eastern Atlantic, western Indian, and tropical
   western and southern Pacific oceans, and on additional material from
   various museums and institutions in the world. Eighteen species,
   including ten new species, are divided in two informal species groups,
   P. gracilis (Smith, 1882) group and P modumanuensis (Rathbun, 1906)
   group. The first group contains I I species: P. gracilis (type species
   of the genus), P abyssi (Smith, 1884), P. junceus (Bate, 1888), P.
   profundus (Bate, 1888), P occidentalis (Faxon, 1893), P talismani
   (Crosnier & Forest, 1973), P cornutus n. sp., P cyrton n. sp., P
   difficilis n. sp., P. geminus n. sp. and P. longirostris n. sp. The
   second group contains seven species: P. modumanuensis (Rathbun, 1906),
   P. demani (Chace, 1984), P caledonicus n. sp., P. juxta n. sp., P.
   psyllus n. sp., P. sibogae n. sp. and P. stenorhinus in. sp. Six taxa
   originally described as full species by their authors and occasionally
   treated as subspecies, viz. P. gracilis, P abyssi, P. junceus, P.
   profundus, P occidentalis, and P talismani, are here maintained as full
   species because of the existence of morphological differences and of the
   partial overlap of geographical or bathymetrical ranges. All species are
   diagnosed or rediagnosed, and illustrated. Synonymies of Pontophilus
   challengeri Ortmann, 1893 with Parapontophilus abyssi and of Pontophilus
   occidentalis var. indica de Man, 1918 with Parapontophilus junceus were
   con firmed. A key to aid in the identification of all Parapontophilus
   species is given, although it should be used with caution because of
   intraspecific variations exhibited by many of the species. Bathymetrical
   and geographical distributions of species are also summarized. All but
   P. sibogae n. sp. are exclusively found at more than 200 in depth, and
   particularly three species, P. abyssi, P occidentalis, and P talismani,
   occur at abyssal depths exceeding 3000 m. Parapontophilus sibogae
   inhabits shallow water, recorded at depth of I I m in the type locality.
   Two species, P gracilis and P talismani, appear restricted to the
   Atlantic Ocean, although widely distributed there. Three species, P
   abyssi, P longirostris n. sp., and P. juxta n. sp. occur in the Indian
   Ocean; P abyssi is also widely distributed in the Atlantic and P
   longirostris extends to the central Pacific. Parapontophilus
   occidentalis appears restricted to the eastern Pacific. Other species
   are distributed in the range of the western Pacific to French Polynesia.

AB Iron (Fe) deposition in the equatorial Pacific has important
   implications for the global carbon cycle, while the provenance of Fe
   supply and its change remain highly debated. Here, we geochemically
   characterize the provenance of terrigenous sediments deposited on the
   pathways of the Equatorial Undercurrent (EUC) and the New Guinea Coastal
   Undercurrent (NGCUC). The Fe-enriched sediments in the western
   equatorial Pacific are mostly derived from fluvial inputs of Papua New
   Guinea (PNG), while nearly negligible impact from eolian dust could be
   detected. Variability of the terrigenous Fe-enriched deposition
   (7.4-13.4%) for core KX21-2 in the western equatorial Pacific over the
   past 380 ka shows dominant precession periods, superimposed on a clear
   glacial-interglacial trend with higher input during glacials. The
   precession periods are correlated with the precipitation over PNG, in
   response to the local summer insolation (5 degrees S, March) and
   meridional migration of the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ). The
   glacial-interglacial trend is induced by sea level fluctuations that
   significantly influence the fluvial input from southern PNG. The
   different expressions of precession periods between glacials and
   interglacials in core KX21-2 are tightly associated with the
   undercurrent. The subdued precession periods during interglacials can be
   attributed to the weakness of the NGCUC, which may link to La Nina-like
   conditions. The enhanced precession periods during glacials should
   result from increased input from southern PNG on one hand, and an
   intensified NGCUC on the other hand, due to the El Nino-like conditions.
   Compared to Fe, the proxy In (Ti/Total) (XRF log-ratio of Ti/Total
   counts) for core KX21-2 preferentially indicates the northern PNG input,
   and therefore could be used to reflect the glacial changes in the NGCUC.
   Our records imply that the NGCUC was particularly stronger in MIS 6 and
   10, and weaker in MIS 8. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Marine plastic pollution is present in all oceans, including remote
   oceanic islands. Despite the increasing number of articles on plastic
   pollution in the last years, there is still a lack of studies in
   islands, that are biodiversity hotspots when compared to the surrounding
   ocean, and even other recognized highly biodiverse marine environments.
   Articles published in the peer reviewed literature (N = 20) were
   analysed according to the presence of macro (>5 mm) and microplastics
   (<5 mm) on beaches and the marine habitats immediately adjacent to 31
   islands of the Atlantic Ocean and Caribbean Sea. The first articles date
   from the 1980s, but most were published in the 2000s. Articles on
   macroplastics were predominant in this review (N = 12). Beaches were the
   most studied environment, possibly due to easy access. The main focus of
   most articles was the spatial distribution of plastics associated with
   variables such as position of the beach in relation to wind and
   currents. Very few studies have analysed plastics colonization by
   organisms or the identification of persistent organic pollutants (POPs).
   Islands of the North/South Atlantic and Caribbean Sea were influenced by
   different sources of macroplastics, being marine based sources (i.e.,
   fishing activities) predominant in the Atlantic Ocean basin. On the
   other hand, in the Caribbean Sea, land-based sources were more common.

AB A review of past behavioral ultrasonic telemetry studies of sharks and
   rays is presented together with previously unpublished material on the
   behavior of the lemon shark, Negaprion brevirostris, around the Bimini
   Islands, Bahamas. The review, focusing on movement behaviors of 20 shark
   and three ray species, reveals that elasmobranchs exhibit a variety of
   temporal and spatial patterns in terms of rates-of-movement and vertical
   as well as horizontal migrations. The lack of an apparent pattern in a
   few species is probably attributable to the scarcity of tracking data.
   Movements are probably governed by several factors, some still not
   studied, but data show that food, water temperature, bottom type, and
   magnetic gradient play major roles in a shark's decision of where and
   when to swim. A few species exhibit differences in behavior between
   groups of sharks within the same geographical area. This interesting
   finding warrants further research to evaluate the causes of these
   apparent differences and whether these groups constitute different
   subpopulations of the same species. The lack of telemetry data on
   batoids and some orders of sharks must be addressed before we can gain a
   more comprehensive understanding of the behavior of elasmobranch fishes.
   Previously unpublished data from 47 smaller and 38 larger juvenile lemon
   sharks, collected over the decade 1988-1998, provide new results on
   movement patterns, habitat selection, activity rhythms, swimming speed,
   rate-of-movement, and homing behavior. From these results we conclude
   that the lemon shark is an active predator with a strong, apparently
   innate homing mechanism. This species shows ontogenetic differences in
   habitat selection and behavior, as well as differences in movements
   between groups of individuals within the same area. We suggest three
   hypotheses for future research on related topics that will help to
   understand the enigmatic behavior of sharks.

AB Stingrays (Order: Myliobatiformes) are well-known predators that feed on
   a variety of marine species including crustaceans, teleosts, molluscs
   and annelids. Here, a predatory attack by a stingray on the large
   spatangoid echinoid Meoma ventricosa (Lamarck) is reported from the
   shallow-water carbonate platform of San Salvador, Bahamas. A single
   stingray was observed feeding on a large adult specimen of M. ventricosa
   near Sand Dollar Beach, San Salvador Island. The partially crushed and
   partially eviscerated test of the attacked echinoid was collected from
   the feeding site. In addition, a crushed test of a freshly killed,
   smaller irregular clypeasteroid echinoid Leodia sexiesperforata (Leske)
   was also recovered at the same site. In both cases, the test was broken
   across the test plates and not along plate boundaries. Meoma ventricosa
   showed major plate loss on the oral side; however, bite traces and spine
   loss were not observed in the damaged areas. Similarly, L.
   sexiesperforata showed no evidence of spine removal; however, bite marks
   were identifiable. The observed test damage in both taxa is
   morphologically distinct and could be potentially identifiable in the
   fossil record.

AB Recent advances in understanding insect communities in tropical
   forests(1,2) have contributed little to our knowledge of large-scale
   patterns of insect diversity, because incomplete taxonomic knowledge of
   many tropical species hinders the mapping of their distribution
   records(3). This impedes an understanding of global biodiversity
   patterns and explains why tropical insects are under-represented in
   conservation biology. Our study of approximately 500 species from three
   herbivorous guilds feeding on foliage (caterpillars, Lepidoptera), wood
   (ambrosia beetles, Coleoptera) and fruit (fruitflies, Diptera) found a
   low rate of change in species composition (beta diversity) across 75,000
   square kilometres of contiguous lowland rainforest in Papua New Guinea,
   as most species were widely distributed. For caterpillars feeding on
   large plant genera, most species fed on multiple host species, so that
   even locally restricted plant species did not support endemic
   herbivores. Large plant genera represented a continuously distributed
   resource easily colonized by moths and butterflies over hundreds of
   kilometres. Low beta diversity was also documented in groups with
   differing host specificity (fruitflies and ambrosia beetles), suggesting
   that dispersal limitation does not have a substantial role in shaping
   the distribution of insect species in New Guinea lowland rainforests.
   Similar patterns of low beta diversity can be expected in other tropical
   lowland rainforests, as they are typically situated in the extensive low
   basins of major tropical rivers similar to the Sepik-Ramu region of New
   Guinea studied here.

AB There has been much recent discussion about the idea that large whales
   are potential competitors with fisheries for available marine resources.
   Based on this idea, often referred to as the 'whales eat fish' conflict,
   culling whales has been proposed as a way to increase resources
   available for human consumption and thereby ensuring global food
   security. However, the scientific basis for such arguments remains
   unclear, especially in the Caribbean waters where baleen whales
   generally do not feed. In this article, we (i) develop an ecosystem
   model describing the trophic interactions between whales, fish and
   fisheries in the Caribbean waters, (ii) calculate the level of overlap
   between cetaceans and fisheries for food resources, and (iii) simulate
   the removal of cetaceans from the Caribbean waters in order to quantify
   the potential increase in available biomass of commercially important
   fish. Ten groups of cetaceans are considered in the model, including
   baleen whales, toothed whales and small cetaceans. Our results suggest
   that baleen whales are not a threat to fisheries in Caribbean waters,
   while toothed cetaceans seem to be more impacted by fisheries than they
   actually impacting them. Whales target different types of food resources
   and consume significantly less than what is taken by fisheries.
   Moreover, simulated reductions in large whale abundance do not produce
   any appreciable increase in biomass of the commercially important fish
   species. In some cases, the presence of some whales actually improves
   fishery yield as a result of indirect predation effects.

AB This study set out to test the hypothesis that hurricanes and tropical
   storms limit the recruitment and subsequent survival of massive
   non-branching corals on the barrier reef off the coast of Belize in the
   Gulf of Honduras. Overall, the surface areas of 523 individual coral
   specimens were measured, and recruitment dates were then modelled. There
   was no significant difference in coral cover or coral biodiversity
   between any of the sites studied (p > 0.1). There were significant
   differences in non-branching coral recruitment in years when hurricanes
   impacted the area (p < 0.05) compared with years when no hurricanes
   impacted the area. There were significantly more non-branching massive
   corals recruited in non-hurricane years (mean 7.7) than in hurricane
   years (mean 3.8; p = 0.011). When years with tropical storms are added
   to the years with hurricanes, there was significantly lower coral
   recruitment (mean 4.7) relative to non-storm or hurricane years (mean
   7.4; p = 0.019). These results show that hurricanes and severe storms
   limited the recruitment and survival of massive non-branching corals of
   the Mesoamerican barrier reef and on patch reefs near the Belize coast
   in the Caribbean, and suggests that marine park managers may need to
   assist coral recruitment in years where there are hurricanes or severe
   storms. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This paper examines neoliberalism coupled with corporate social
   responsibility (CSR) endeavours in the context of international
   extractive companies and their implications on the psyche and
   livelihoods of rural people of developing countries. The inevitability
   of international capital with neoliberal ideals imposing on sometimes
   unsuspecting rural social and environmental landscapes of developing
   countries has become real in recent decades. While international capital
   is discriminative in its accumulative role via the placating role of CSR
   in such countries, the hosts, including the governments, sometimes
   continue to largely miscomprehend the implications of their absorption
   into a dominant global economy. The paper addresses some of the poignant
   points of local community livelihood struggles whilst discussing the
   Lake Kutubu villagers as they host an oil company in their pristine
   backyards in Papua New Guinea (PNG). The company's strategies of CSR and
   community 'empowerment' in the form of a food security programme are
   critically examined to highlight inherent contradictions embedded in a
   globalised extractive industry. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

   Caribbean reef fish populations on recreational divers' consumer
   surplus. Over five hundred tourist SCUBA divers were interviewed at
   seven sites across three Caribbean countries representing a diversity of
   individuals within the Caribbean dive market A choice experiment was
   used to assess willingness to pay as a function of the abundance and
   size of reef fishes, the presence of fishing activity/gear, and dive
   price. Despite some preference heterogeneity both between and within
   sites, the results indicate that future declines in the abundance of
   reef fishes, and particularly in the number of large fishes observed on
   recreational dives, will result in significant reductions in diver
   consumer surplus. On the other hand, improvements in fish populations
   and reduced fishing gear encounters are likely to result in significant
   economic gains. These results can be used to justify investment in
   pre-emptive management strategies targeted at improving reef fish stocks
   (namely reducing unsustainable fishing activities and land-based reef
   impacts), managing conflicting uses, as well as to indicate a possible
   source of financing for such conservation activities. (C) 2015 Elsevier

AB Smallholder farmers are key actors in addressing the food and nutrition
   insecurity challenges facing the Caribbean Community (CARICOM), while
   also minimizing the ecological footprint of food production systems.
   However, fostering innovation in the region's smallholder farming
   systems will require more decentralized, adaptive, and heterogeneous
   institutional structures and approaches than presently exist. In this
   paper, we review the conditions that have been undermining sustainable
   food and nutrition security in the Caribbean, focusing on issues of
   history, economy, and innovation. Building on this discussion, we then
   argue for a different approach to agricultural development in the Small
   Island Developing States of the CARICOM that draws primarily on
   socioecological resilience and agricultural innovation systems
   frameworks. Research needs are subsequently identified, including the
   need to better understand how social capital can facilitate adaptive
   capacity in diverse smallholder farming contexts; how formal and
   informal institutions interact in domestic agriculture and food systems
   to affect collaboration, co-learning, and collective action; how social
   actors might better play bridging and linking roles that can support
   mutual learning, collaboration, and reciprocal knowledge flows; and the
   reasons underlying past innovation failures and successes to facilitate
   organizational learning.

   countries in Asia, Africa and Papua New Guinea. There were marked
   differences in the length (range 15.88-19 mm), breadth (10.20-11.71 mm),
   thickness (7.95-9.37 mm) and volume index of seed (1337-2000 mm(3)),
   weight of seed (42.67-80.20 g) and kernel (18.44-51.04 g), kernel/seed
   ratio (0.43-0.66), and oil content in seed (18.08-37.89%) and kernel
   (34.02-59.09%). In general, seeds from Laos, Mali, Papua New Guinea,
   Philippines and Thailand were larger and heavier than sources from China
   and India, but contained lower oil content in seed and kernel. Principal
   component analysis revealed that seed and kernel weight and oil content
   in whole seed and in kernel were useful characteristics in explaining
   the variation pattern among seed sources. Seven out of the 24 seed
   sources investigated in this study are considered promising for planting
   for oil-seed production. This study underpins the importance of
   selecting suitable seed sources for commercial plantation establishment
   of J. curcas.

AB While islands have been identified in numerous discourses as being
   highly vulnerable, food security was a cornerstone of many traditional
   Pacific Island societies from inland and coastal communities in large
   islands with considerable natural assets to those that occupied
   extremely small, low-lying atolls with little or no soil and limited
   water resources. This was sustained through agro-ecological
   biodiversity, the production of surpluses which enabled food
   preservation and storage to be practiced and underpinned networks of
   exchange and mutual support that were particularly important during
   times of hardship such as disruptive extreme natural events, the use of
   resilient crops and using 'famine' foods. Colonisation, the introduction
   of new religions, the spread of capitalism, most recently in the context
   of globalisation, has seen many of these practices decline (some have
   disappeared altogether) as crop diversity has been reduced (making way
   for export products such as copra), food storage and preservation are
   now rarely practised, resilient crops have been replaced, famine foods
   have lost their importance in the face of disaster relief, and many
   traditional networks have declined. Food imports have become critical,
   not only in the growing urban areas, but also in rural communities. The
   paper concludes by addressing key challenges facing Pacific Island
   countries in order to revitalise those traditional elements of food
   security in ways that are likely to find acceptance in contemporary
   society and enable them to adapt to the effects of climate change.

AB Stilt structures in the inter-tidal zone or over shallow water on
   fringing reefs are widely accepted as a feature of settlements of the
   Lapita cultural complex in Near Oceania. Claims for similar structures
   in a pre-Lapita context at the Apalo site in the Arawe Islands, New
   Britain, Papua New Guinea, have been queried on several grounds.
   Re-evaluation of the Apalo evidence, together with 10 additional AMS
   radiocarbon dates, establishes human activity associated with some form
   of structure and possibly with a ground stone axe about 400-500years
   before the Lapita pottery occupation. The paucity of occupational refuse
   suggests a non-residential structure perhaps associated with water
   transport. Comparisons with the older Dongan midden site in the
   Sepik-Ramu basin suggest stilt structures were probably used there as
   well. An apparent shift in depositional processes between the pre-Lapita
   and Lapita use of Apalo could reflect changed sea conditions arising
   from increased ENSO activity.

AB Moringa (Moringa oleifera Lam.) is known as "wonder tree" for its
   potential health benefits and its ability to cure several diseases in
   animals and humans. Its extracts have been used for insect pest
   management. Just like any other plant, M. oleifera is also attacked by
   various kinds of arthropods and diseases. Our initial literature search
   and anecdotal information collected from selected Pacific Islands
   countries (Fiji, Tonga and Samoa), suggests that no pests of M. oleifera
   are either documented or recorded. Thus, this study endeavoured to
   survey pests of M. oleifera in the Pacific, especially in Samoa. We
   examined different parts of the M. oleifera plant, such as flower,
   fruits (drumsticks and pods), leaves, stems and trunks for signs of
   insect damage. Samples for pest examination were collected from Apia and
   nearby area on the Upolu Island, and were examined with the naked eye
   and also under a stereomicroscope. Our results showed minor damage to
   the M. oleifera flowers. Plant hoppers (nymphs and adults) were
   frequently observed on the upper surface of the M. oleifera leaves.
   Severe stem borer damage was observed as tunnels on the main trunk and
   branches of the tree. The length of the tunnels observed was up to 45
   cm, with a diameter ranging from 8-15 mm. Thus, our preliminary
   exploratory insect pest survey indicates that M. oleifera in Samoa is
   attacked by plant hoppers and stem borer. However, their infestations
   are currently at low levels and no pest management strategy is currently
   available to manage them. However, a pest management strategy should be
   developed as M. oleifera is already gaining importance in most Pacific
   Island countries and territories, in food and nutrition security
   programmes.

AB Nine angustine-type alkaloids were isolated from ammoniacal extracts of
   Nauclea orientalis L. (Rubiaceae). Three of them, 10-hydroxyangustine
   and the two diastereoisomeric 3,14-dihydroangustolines, have not been
   described in the literature thus far. The structures of the isolates
   were determined with spectroscopic methods, mainly 1D- and 2D-NMR
   spectroscopy. The compounds were found to exhibit in vitro
   antiproliferative activity against the human bladder carcinoma T-24 cell
   line and against EGF (epidermal growth factor)-dependent mouse epidermal
   keratinocytes. By using overpressure layer chromatography, it was shown
   that minor quantities of these alkaloids occur in dried Nauclea
   orientalis leaves. The use of ammonia in the extraction process results
   in a significant increase in the formation of angustine-type alkaloids
   from strictosamide-type precursors.

AB We visually observed fish traps in situ to identify the habitats
   exploited by the U. S. Virgin Islands fishery and to document species
   composition and abundance in traps by habitat. Fishers set more traps in
   algal plains than in any other habitat around St. John. Coral reefs,
   traditionally targeted by fishers, accounted for only 16% of traps.
   Traps in algal plain contained the highest number of fishes per trap and
   the greatest numbers of preferred food species. Traps on coral reefs
   contained the most species, 41 of the 59 taxa observed in the study.
   Acanthurus coeruleus was the most abundant species and Acanthuridae the
   most abundant family observed in traps. Piscivore numbers were low and
   few serranids were observed. Traps in algal plain contained the most
   fishes as a result of: ecological changes such as shifts in habitat use,
   mobility of species and degradation of nearshore habitat (fishery
   independent); and, catchability of fishes and long-term heavy fishing
   pressure (fishery dependent). The low number of serranids per trap,
   dominance of the piscivore guild by a small benthic predator,
   Epinephelus guttatus, and dominance of trap contents overall by a small,
   fast-growing species of a lower trophic guild, Acanthurus coeruleus, all
   point to years of intense fishing pressure.

AB Territorial damselfish are considered to be functionally important
   herbivores on coral reefs, promoting the abundance of preferred algae
   and depleting corals through a variety of 'farming' activities. However,
   the composition of algal and coral communities inside territories and
   patterns of feeding selectivity are known for only a few species. Here
   we compare substrata inside and next to territories of
   Plectroglyphidodon lacrymatus, F dickii and Stegastes nigricans, 3
   common damselfish in Papua New Guinea, and interpret patterns in
   relation to diets and patterns of feeding selectivity. The coral
   assemblages inside territories differed among fish species and also
   between defended and non-defended areas. Live corals dominated P. dickii

   primarily associated with algal substrata. Territories of F lacrymatus
   were similar in coral composition to adjacent areas, while those of P.
   dickii and S. nigricans were associated with particular coral taxa.
   Territories of the 3 damselfish were similar in algal composition, with
   mixed turf algae (primarily blue-green algae Polysiphonia spp. and other
   filamentous red algae) more prominent inside territories and crustose
   coralline algae more prominent outside. Diets for the 3 species were
   also similar, as each species was primarily herbivorous and diets
   consisted of diatoms, blue-green algae, Polysiphonia spp. and other
   filamentous red algae. An experimental removal of P. lacrymatus showed
   that they promoted epiphyte loads without influencing macro-algal or
   coral cover. Our results suggest that while these 3 species of
   damselfish vary in their interactions with coral reef habitat, they
   selectively cultivate a similar range of epiphytic food algae on
   different substrata.

AB The experience of villagers in Maimafu, in the Crater Mountain Wildlife
   Management Area of the Eastern Highlands of Papua New Guinea, calls
   attention to two forms of social interaction between rural people and
   outsiders that have been little examined in the anthropological
   literature. One of these is scientific research and the other is
   scientific tourism, a form of ecotourism that is linked not to science
   but to self-fashioning and individual gain. Scientific tourists may be
   seeking an educational adventure that they can turn into symbolic
   capital on their return home, a way into the world of science, or an
   experience that can be turned into economic capital through publication
   in popular magazines. For both researchers and scientific journalists,
   New Guinea combines the exotic, the about-to-be-lost, the primitive, the
   untouched, and the spectacular and is therefore a powerful space for
   imaginary and representational practice.

AB The population structure of the giant mottled eel, Anguilla marmorata,
   was investigated with mitochondrial and microsatellite DNA analyses
   using 449 specimens from 13 localities throughout the species range.
   Control region F-statistics indicated the North Pacific (Japan, Taiwan,
   Philippines, Sulawesi), South Pacific (Tahiti, Fiji, New Caledonia,
   Papua New Guinea), eastern Indian Ocean (Sumatra), western Indian Ocean
   (Reunion, Madagascar), Ambon, and Guam regions were significantly
   different (Phi(ST) = 0.131-0.698, P < 0.05) while only a few differences
   were observed between localities within the South Pacific. These regions
   were roughly clustered in the neighbour-joining tree, although Ambon
   individuals were mainly divided into North and South Pacific groups.
   Analysis with eight microsatellite loci showed almost identical results
   to those of the control region, except no genetic difference was
   observed between the western and eastern Indian Ocean (F(ST) = 0.009, P
   > 0.05). The Bayesian cluster analysis of the microsatellite data
   detected two genetic groups. One included four North Pacific localities,
   and the other included eight localities in the South Pacific, Indian
   Ocean, and Guam, but Ambon individuals were evenly assigned to these two
   groups. These results showed that A. marmorata has four genetically
   different populations (North Pacific, South Pacific, Indian Ocean, Guam
   region). The North Pacific population is fully panmictic whereas the
   South Pacific and Indian Ocean populations have a metapopulation
   structure. Interestingly, Guam was suggested to be inhabited by a
   reproductive population restricted to that region, and the individuals
   from the North and South Pacific populations co-exist in Ambon.

   in an aggregated distribution with a mean inter-tree distance of 88.9 m.
   The sample consisted of 35 female and 29 male trees with a mean shortest
   distance between sexes of 232 m. Seed production and seed removal of 22
   female trees was monitored throughout the 1992 fruiting season. Female
   trees within 200 m of male trees generally produced large seeds crops (>
   100 seeds) whereas trees farther than 200 m from the nearest male had
   small seed crops (< 100 seeds) regardless of female size (DBH). Most
   seeds (63.2%, n = 3312) produced in a sub-sample of 22 trees came from
   the five most fecund trees, which also produced 74.1% of the seeds that
   were removed by vertebrate dispersers. Where a minority of a population
   of rare tropical trees produce the majority of progeny, sustainable
   harvest practices would be most effective where highly fecund
   individuals are identified and conserved.

AB Tropical terrestrial environments are becoming dominated by
   anthropogenic land-uses, making retention of biodiversity in production
   landscapes of critical conservation importance. Native timber
   plantations may represent a land-use capable of balancing production and
   conservation by potentially supporting understorey plant and tree
   species otherwise restricted to old-growth forests, with little impact
   on yield. In this study we investigated the conservation value of native
   plantation forests in the lowlands of New Britain, Papua New Guinea. We
   compared the composition of tree species (>= 10 cm DBH) of unlogged
   forest to those of different aged native Eucalyptus deglupta plantations
   and intervening (historically logged) secondary forests. We found a high
   capacity for biodiversity conservation within plantations, with 70% of
   forest tree species persisting in mature plantations (13-15 years old).
   However, compositional analyses revealed lower numbers of large
   individuals (>= 10 cm DBH) in both late-successional and
   non-vertebrate-dispersed species in the plantations, indicating the
   difficulty of retaining mature old-growth forest trees in production
   land-uses. Secondary forest protected by conservation reserves was
   compositionally indistinct to unlogged forest. Our results demonstrate
   the potential for tropical native timber plantations to contribute to
   the retention of biodiversity. However, appropriate management is
   required to ensure the persistence of source populations of old-growth
   forest tree species. With careful planning a balance between production
   and conservation can be achieved in lowland tropical regions. (C) 2014

AB The world's second largest fish, the basking shark (Cetorhinus maximus),
   is broadly distributed in boreal to warm temperate latitudes of the
   Atlantic and Pacific oceans from shallow coastal waters to the open
   ocean [1, 2]. Previous satellite archival tagging in the North Atlantic
   has shown that basking sharks move seasonally, are often associated with
   productive frontal zones [3, 4], and may make occasional dives to
   mesopelagic depths [3, 5]. However, basking sharks are thought to be
   restricted to temperate latitudes, and the extent to which they exploit
   deeper-water habitat remains enigmatic. Via satellite archival tags and
   a novel geo-location technique, we demonstrate here that basking sharks
   are seasonal migrants to mesopelagic tropical waters. Tagged sharks
   moved from temperate feeding areas off the coast of southern New England
   to the Bahamas, the Caribbean Sea, and onward to the coast of South
   America and into the Southern Hemisphere. When in these areas, basking
   sharks descended to mesopelagic depths and in some cases remained there
   for weeks to months at a time. Our results demonstrate that tropical
   waters are not a barrier to migratory connectivity for basking shark
   populations and highlight the need for global conservation efforts
   throughout the species range.

AB Tourism development is one of the main contemporary drivers of habitat
   loss and fragmentation within the Caribbean Islands biodiversity
   hotspot. In Saint Lucia, construction of a hotel and golf course within
   coastal dry forest is directly threatening the largest known
   subpopulation of the Endangered White-breasted Thrasher Ramphocinclus
   brachyurus. Understanding how the species is responding to ongoing
   landscape change and identifying priority sites for conservation are
   imperative for planning its long-term conservation. In this study, a
   four year White-breasted Thrasher monitoring dataset (2006-2009) and
   landscape-scale environmental variables were used to: a) identify,
   characterise and map spatio-temporal patterns of White-breasted Thrasher
   encounter rate (an abundance proxy) within and outside the tourist
   development site; b) determine landscape-scale environmental variables
   that influence such patterns, and c) produce an island-wide predictive
   map of potentially suitable habitat. Observed patterns in encounter
   rates within and outside the development site were consistent with
   thrashers being displaced from cleared areas of forest and crowding into
   intact forest patches to the north and west of the golf course. A year
   after the period of the most extensive habitat clearance, White-breasted
   Thrasher numbers declined markedly leading to a 55% reduction in
   encounter rate within the development site over the four years of the
   study. The habitat suitability model predicted that a range of sites
   outside of the known geographic range of the thrasher are potentially
   suitable, some of which merit further surveys for potentially undetected
   populations. Given these findings, it is vital that patches of suitable
   dry forest adjacent to the tourist development are protected and
   contiguous natural habitat inside the tourist development is preserved.

AB The minimum stratigraphic age and the timing of dolomitization have been
   constrained in sediments of late Cenozoic age in the Bahamas (Little
   Bahama Bank-LBB, Andros, New Providence, San Salvador, Great Inagua and
   Mayaguana) using the Sr-isotope composition (Sr-87/Sr-86) of dolomites.
   Most dolomite sequences investigated are composites of several
   dolomitization episodes.  Five phases of dolomitization have been
   recognized, the most extensive of which are early Late Miocene and Late
   Pliocene in age.  Two minor phases occurred later during the latest
   Pliocene/early Pleistocene and late Pleistocene.  The fifth phase (late
   Early Miocene) is only recognized in San Salvador.  Commonly,
   dolomitization episodes are stacked, indicating an increasing age with
   depth.  Only in San Salvador are younger dolomites interspersed with
   older ones.
   The Late Pliocene episode on LBB is the best constrained, lasting
   probably less than 0.6 Ma and causing extensive dolomitization.  The
   shape of the dolomite body, together with the age of diagenesis,
   provides support for a dolomite origin from seawater in a hydrologic
   environment characterized by a mixing zone induced seawater circulation.
   Variable depth of burial of Middle Miocene dolomitized strata indicates
   non-uniform subsidence behavior of Bahamian carbonate platforms.
   Strontium-isotope ratios of other late Cenozoic dolomites (Hope Gate
   Formation, Jamaica; Seroi Domi Formation, Netherlands Antilles; Rangiroa
   Atoll; Niue Atoll-Aharon et al. 1987) also indicate early Late Miocene
   and Late Pliocene dolomite ages.  Simultaneous dolomitization in the
   Bahamas, the Caribbean and the Pacific appears to occur during times
   when the marine Sr-87/Sr-86 ratio is either constant or decreasing. 
   This suggests that dolomitization of carbonate platforms and the
   evolution of Sr-isotope ratios in seawater are linked, possibly via
   eustatic sea-level fluctuations.

AB The emergence of the Isthmus of Panama subdivided the amphi-American
   biota. In the present study; Pacific and Atlantic populations of four
   cognate pairs of crabs were used to discern whether exposure to
   different thermal regimes in habitats, in the putative absence of gene
   flow, has resulted in physiological divergence. Populations that
   potentially form a common genetic pool were also used; these were
   populations of the Atlantic Panama cognate that occur in belize and
   Florida. Decreases in water temperature occur periodically in Pacific
   Panama and Florida, but nor in Atlantic Panama or Belize. In this study,
   physiological divergence in oxygen uptake was assessed in response to
   repeated exposure to either control and decreased temperature or control
   and increased temperature. Results indicate that, in only some of the
   genera tested, exposure to decreases in habitat temperature has resulted
   in divergence. Partial support is found for the corollary that
   adaptation to an environment with periods of decreased temperature
   results in reduced compensation during exposure to elevated temperature.

AB The global agro-food complex is penetrating the most 'isolated' and
   'peripheral' localities of the world. In the Pacific Islands, a second
   wave of globalisation is pulling a number of small island nations into
   the increasingly globalised neoliberal agricultural sector. Conscious of
   the under-analysis of globalisation in Southern agriculture in general,
   this article has three broad aims. Firstly, it contextualises and traces
   the evolution of the second wave of globalisation, compares it to the
   first, and discusses its impacts on the agricultural sector of the
   Pacific Islands. Secondly, it explores the local socio-economic and
   environmental impacts of the second wave through two primary
   research-based case studies in Tonga and Niue. Finally, it calls for a
   concerted critical research effort designed to uncover the workings of
   neoliberal agricultural globalisation in the region and suggests means
   of resisting its worst implications. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All

AB The cover of noncoralline macroalgae increased dramatically on Caribbean
   reefs during the 1980s and 1990s. A top-down hypothesis, based largely
   on observations at Discovery Bay, Jamaica, is that this change was
   caused by reduced herbivory. Herbivory was reduced by the regional mass
   mortality of the echinoid Diadema antillarum in 1983-1984 and by human
   exploitation of herbivorous fishes. An alternative, bottom-up
   explanation is that nun-lent concentrations increased past threshold
   levels for algal blooms. Surveys at Discovery Bay showed that Diadema
   reappeared on the shallow fore reef after 1996, accompanied by
   drastically reduced macroalgal cover. There is no evidence to suggest
   that nutrient levels declined at the same time. These observations
   corroborate predictions of the top-down hypothesis, and they confirm the
   key role of herbivory in structuring shallow reef communities of the
   Caribbean.

AB A well-preserved, submerged, in situ fossil reef tract lies offshore of
   the southeast Florida carbonate margin in the Florida Keys. Cores in two
   transects enabled reconstruction of reef stratigraphy and
   paleoenvironments, paleo water depths, and paleo sea-levels. Because
   Florida is tectonically stable, the elevation data required correction
   only for the known, minor subsidence rate. Twenty eight pristine
   aragonitic corals were dated via high-precision TIMS U-series methods to
   produce a comprehensive late Pleistocene and early Holocene
   geochronology. The Pleistocene section of the fossil reef includes a
   thick section of Substage 5a reef growth recorded from approximate to-15
   to -11 m MSL, spanning an age range of 86.2-80.9 ka. Paleoenvironmental
   reconstruction, local water quality constraints, and elevations of
   concurrent Bahamian speleothem growth combine to limit sea-level to
   approximate to-9.0 m MSL at approximate to 83 ka. This coincides,
   unlagged, with the 82 ka 65 degrees N July insolation peak: the absence
   of any lag suggests that the earlier peak in obliquity at 92 ka also
   controls paleoclimate and sea-level. A below-present sea-level estimate
   for Substage 5a from the Florida fossil reef data coincides more closely
   with uplift-corrected reef data estimates of -15 to -13 m MSL from
   tectonic margins such as Barbados and Haiti, than with higher than
   present sea-levels derived from detrital corals from Bermuda and the
   U.S. Atlantic Coastal Plain. The best TIMS dates on corals and
   speleothem constraining sea-level combine to produce a new regional
   sea-level curve for the Atlantic-Caribbean region for late isotope stage
   5 and early stage 4. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

   destinations for the purpose of riding surfboards, and earlier research
   suggests the mismanagement of surf tourism in some destinations has
   resulted in significant deleterious impacts on host communities. The
   research question in this study addresses how surf tourism can be
   managed to achieve sustainable host community benefits in the context of
   a developing country. Primary data came from semi-structured interviews
   and participant observation. The findings demonstrate how sport
   governing bodies can engage host communities in a collaborative
   framework for the sustainable utilization of sport tourism resources.
   The derived knowledge from this research may decrease host communities'
   reliance on less sustainable commercial activities, and inform policy
   and practice on sustainable approaches to using sport tourism for
   community building and poverty alleviation.

AB The objective of this volume is to document the marine biodiversity of
   Guam, a small island at the southern end of the Mariana island arc. Guam
   has the best-documented marine biota in Micronesia, and affords a
   glimpse at the great biodiversity of Pacific island reefs. The papers
   that follow strive to provide a critical inventory of the marine biota
   of Guam, with less comprehensive coverage of other Mariana Islands.
   Diatoms are the only previously studied group not included. This paper
   serves to introduce and overview this effort, the Marine Biodiversity
   Survey of Guam. The environmental setting and marine habitats of the
   Marianas are briefly reviewed, followed by a description of the methods
   and resources used for the survey. A brief overview is presented of what
   we know and how much remains to be learned about species richness of
   major taxa in the region. Of the 6172 species listed in this volume,
   5640 are recorded from marine habitats in the Marianas. This represents
   the greatest marine diversity recorded for any area of comparable size.
   Nevertheless most taxa remain poorly known, and the daily discovery of
   new records shows that even the most intensively surveyed groups remain
   incompletely studied and that the actual marine diversity of these
   islands is much greater.

AB Waigani Lake, near Port Moresby, Papua New Guinea, is part of an
   extensive wetland dominated by the Laloki and Brown Rivers. The wetland
   has received sewage effluent from stabilisation ponds for over 25 years.
   Water quality of the sewage, Waigani Lake and its outflow assessed in
   1985 indicated that the wetland was significantly reducing suspended
   solid loads and the concentrations of dissolved nitrogen and phosphorus.
   Aerial photographs of Waigani Lake taken between 1966 and 1991 document
   the complete loss of submerged and floating-leaved plants and the
   decline in the extent of the littoral, emergent vegetation. These
   changes are related to sewage effluent disposal and, possibly,
   alterations in the magnitude of annual water level fluctuations. This
   study of a tropical wetland to which very large quantities of sewage
   effluent have been added demonstrates that the capacity of wetlands for
   water purification is limited and that further study on tropical
   wetlands is imperative before management strategies developed for
   temperate wetlands are applied directly to them.

AB Pacific land snails are among the most threatened animals on Earth, and
   basic information on the number of extant species is lacking for many
   island groups. The isolated western Pacific archipelago of Belau
   comprises 586 islands, most of which have suitable land snail habitat;
   yet little has been published on the land snail fauna. I undertook
   surveys throughout Belau, searching trees and emergent vegetation, leaf
   litter, and limestone rock. Survey results from selected, geographically
   representative islands are presented here. The total number of species
   found in these areas (117) indicates that there may be ca. 200 extant
   Belau land snail species. This number far exceeds previous estimates.
   Most species are endemic to Belau (95% in this survey), and species
   endemic to one or a few islands are not uncommon. Leaf litter and rock
   dwelling diplommatinid land snails are a large component of the snail
   biota: only 26 Belau diplommatinids have been described, and 81 species
   were collected in this survey. Although caenogastropod land snails
   comprise the most obvious portion of the fauna, notable pulmonates
   include the partulids and endodontoids, two land snail groups that have
   Suffered extinction throughout the Pacific region. Belau has one of the
   most spectacularly diverse extant land snail faunas in the Pacific
   region, and the restricted ranges of many species highlight the need for
   conservation attention, particularly on the island of Babeldaob, which
   is undergoing increased deforestation.

   vary in terms of sampling schemes, parameters and analytical techniques,
   as well as differences in data reporting presentation (i.e. dry weight
   versus wet weight, sediment fraction analyzed, or % lipids). These
   differences make meaningful comparisons of the available data very
   difficult. Furthermore, there is limited data available for most of

   (radio announcements, newspaper ads, video) and in-store (cooking
   demonstrations, taste tests, shelf labeling) components. Consumer
   exposure to the mass media components was high (65% had heard half or
   more of the radio announcements, 74% had seen at least one of the
   newspaper ads). Consumer exposure to the in-store components of the
   intervention was moderate (61% attended at least one cooking
   demonstrations, 59% received at least one recipe card). After adjustment
   for age, sex and education level, increased exposure to the intervention
   was associated with higher diabetes knowledge (p<0.05) and label reading
   knowledge (p<0.05), but not with increased self-efficacy for performing
   promoted healthy behaviors. The intervention was associated with
   increased purchasing of certain promoted foods (p<0.005), including
   oatmeal, turkey chili, fish, canned fruit and local vegetables. It was
   also associated with improvements in healthiness of cooking methods
   (p<0.05). Food store centered interventions have great potential for
   changing cognitive and behavioral factors relating to food choice and
   preparation, and may contribute to lessening the burden of diet-related

AB Aims
   Nestedness is a characteristic of insular metacommunity structure.
   Relatively few studies, however, have attempted to evaluate temporal
   changes in nestedness, or elucidate the mechanisms underlying
   nestedness. I evaluated both spatial and temporal patterns of nestedness
   in the insular floras of four archipelagoes of small islands in the
   Bahamas and the potential underlying environmental gradients.
   Methods
   The NODF (a nestedness metric based on overlap and decreasing fill) and
   the matrix temperature measure, T, were used to quantify nestedness in
   insular floras on small islands near Abaco, Andros, Great Exuma and the
   Exuma Cays, Bahamas. Two different null models were employed for each
   nestedness measure. Six environmental variables were evaluated in
   relation to nestedness by ordering islands according to gradients and
   recalculating NODF scores.
   Important Findings
   All archipelagoes were significantly nested. Nestedness among sites
   contributed more to overall nestedness than did nestedness among
   species. NODF scores varied among archipelagoes, but were surprisingly
   constant over time. Ordering islands by vegetated area yielded the
   highest nestedness scores for three archipelagoes; ordering islands by
   protection from exposure yielded the highest nestedness score for one
   archipelago. Nestedness scores varied little over time even though
   species compositions changed, indicating that extinctions occurred in a
   deterministic manner. The relative importance of area suggests
   extinction is an important mechanism in producing nestedness. Attempting
   to determine the relative importance of immigrations or extinctions
   requires some assumptions, however, and both processes are likely
   cumulative in most cases.

AB Background: The South West Indian Ocean (SWIO) archipelagos and
   Madagascar constitute a hotspot of biodiversity with a high rate of
   endemism. In this area, the endemic subspecies A. m. unicolor has been
   described in Madagascar. It belongs to the African lineage, one of the
   four described evolutionary lineages in honey bees. Despite a long
   beekeeping tradition and several recorded European introductions, few
   studies have been carried out on the diversity and proportion of honey
   bee subspecies. In order to identify and define which evolutionary
   lineages and potential sub-lineages are present in the SWIO, the
   COI-COII intergenic region and the ND2 gene of the mtDNA were sequenced
   in honey bee colonies from three archipelagos. An extensive sampling (n
   = 1184 colonies) was done in the Mascarene (La Reunion, Mauritius,
   Rodrigues), Seychelles (Mah, Praslin, La Digue) and Comoros (Grande
   Comore, Mohli, Anjouan, Mayotte) archipelagos. Islands genetic diversity
   was compared to newly sampled populations from Madagascar, continental
   African and European populations.
   Results: African lineage haplotypes were found in all islands (except
   for Rodrigues). Madagascar, Comoros and Seychelles had 100% of A
   lineage, 95.5% in La Reunion and 56.1% in Mauritius. Among all African
   colonies detected in the SWIO, 98.1% (n = 633) of COI-COII haplotypes
   described the presence of the subspecies A.M. unicolor. Both genetic
   markers revealed i) a new private AI mitochondrial group shared by the
   SWIO archipelagos and Madagascar distant from continental populations;
   ii) the private African haplotypes for each island suggested diversity
   radiation in the archipelagos; iii) the detection of the Comoros
   archipelago as a possible contact area between insular and continental
   African populations. The exotic European C and M lineages were only
   detected in the Mascarene archipelago, but striking differences of
   proportion were observed among islands. Merely 4.6% of European colonies
   were found in La Runion whereas Mauritius cumulated 44%. Here, among the
   84 observed COI-COII haplotypes, 50 were newly described including 13
   which were private to the SWIO archipelagos and Madagascar. Similarly,
   24 of the 34 found ND2 haplotypes were novel which included six
   haplotypes particular to the SWIO populations.
   Conclusion: A new African subgroup was described in the SWIO region with
   mitochondrial genetic evidence that A.m. unicolor is the indigenous
   subspecies of the archipelagos surrounding Madagascar.

AB Habitat variability at multiple spatial scales may affect community
   structure within a given habitat patch, even within seemingly homogenous
   landscapes. In this context, we tested the importance of habitat
   variables at two spatial scales (patch and landscape) in driving fish
   community assembly using experimental artificial reefs constructed
   across a gradient of seagrass cover in a coastal bay of The Bahamas. We
   found that species richness and benthic fish abundance increased over
   time, but eventually reached an asymptote. The correlation between
   habitat variables and community structure strengthened over time,
   suggesting deterministic processes were detectable in community
   assembly. Abundance of benthic fishes, as well as overall community
   structure, were predicted by both patch- and landscape-scale variables,
   with the cover of seagrass at the landscape-scale emerging as the most
   important explanatory variable. Results of this study indicate that
   landscape features can drive differences in community assembly even
   within a general habitat type (i.e., within seagrass beds). A primary
   implication of this finding is that human activities driving changes in
   seagrass cover may cause significant shifts in faunal community
   structure well before complete losses of seagrass habitat.

AB Non-government organisations (NGOs) have long played a role in
   delivering sanitation services to communities in Southeast Asia and
   Pacific countries, particularly in rural areas. In contrast with large
   scale infrastructure focused initiatives, NGO programs commonly focus on
   building linkages between technical and social realms. Drawing on the
   breadth and depth of NGO experiences, there are opportunities for NGOs
   to play a greater role in the sanitation sector and to work in
   partnership with other actors including utilities and government
   agencies to ensure both 'hardware' and 'software' components of
   sanitation are built in to project design and delivery to maximise
   community benefits and ensure longer term system sustainability. This
   paper discusses these issues and considers how the contribution of NGOs
   to the sanitation sector in developing countries might be enhanced. The
   paper is based on recent research for the Australian Agency for
   International Development (AusAID) intended to guide investment in the
   water and sanitation sectors of Asia and Pacific partner countries,
   exploring the potential for increased NGO engagement. The paper presents
   findings of the research concerning NGO roles and approaches, discusses
   existing NGO activities in the sanitation sector in Vietnam and Timor
   Leste and identifies strategies for NGOs and for other sector actors
   including utilities and government agencies to maximise the benefits of
   NGO engagement in the sanitation sector.

AB We examined phylogenetic relationships among three Bathymodiolus species
   in Japanese waters and Bathymodiolus spp. from the Manus Basin by two
   different approaches. Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis allowed us to
   compare 263-407 (average=318) proteins, giving comprehensive information
   on genetic distances among the species. The neighbor-joining tree
   presented two clusters: (1) B. japonicus and B. platifrons and (2) B.
   septemdierum and B. sp. Members of the first cluster contain
   methanotrophic endosymbiotic bacteria and members of the second cluster
   contain thioautotrophic endosymbionts. DNA sequencing of a fragment (415
   bp) of mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (COI) provided a
   neighbor-joining tree with the same topology as that derived from
   protein analysis. Inspection of intraspecific variation in COI in B.
   japonicus and B. platifrons revealed no genetic differentiation between
   mussel populations of either species from cold-water seeps versus
   hydrothermal vents, suggesting high adaptability of these Bathymodiolus
   species to deep-sea chemosynthetic environments. Our results indicated
   genetic exchanges between mussels from distant localities, suggesting
   that a limited dispersal capability of the larvae is not the likely
   factor leading to speciation events in these Bathymodiolus species.

   indet.: either Leptotyphlopidae or Typhlopidae); Abaco boa (Boidae:
   Chilabothrus cf. exsul); rat snake (Colubridae: Pantherophis sp.); water
   snake (Natricidae: Nerodia sp.); and Cuban racer (Dipsadidae: Cubophis
   cf. vudii). Scolecophidia, Chilabothrus exsul, and Cubophis vudii still
   exist on Abaco and have been previously recovered in fossil deposits in
   the West Indies. In contrast, no forms of Pantherophis or Nerodia have
   been reported as fossils anywhere in the West Indies until now. This is
   the first evidence of any indigenous species of Pantherophis (living or
   extinct) in the Caribbean, whereas the only other indigenous Nerodia in
   the West Indies is the extant N. clarkii along the northern coast of
   Cuba. In being present on Abaco in late Pleistocene but not Holocene
   contexts, Pantherophis sp. and Nerodia sp. resemble 17 species that
   apparently did not survive the dramatic changes in climate, habitat, and
   land area associated with the Pleistocene-Holocene Transition in The
   Bahamas. It is likely that Pleistocene fossils of both Pantherophis and
   Nerodia will be found eventually on other Bahamian islands. With the
   discovery of these two snakes, the vertebrate fauna of Sawmill Sink now
   stands at 97 species, by far the richest in the West Indies. (C) 2017

   intertidal burying, adjacent subtidal populations, benthic mobility, and
   larval type. Foraging for mollusks is largely confined to the intertidal
   and shallow subtidal regions, although modern diving gear and outboard
   motors now provide human foragers access to offshore resources. Changes
   brought about by human demographic pressures have resulted in
   overexploitation of a number of molluscan resources. It is suggested
   that the sustainable use of invertebrates and other marine species for

AB Many of the world's terrestrial environments are dominated by production
   land-uses, making the incorporation of production landscapes into
   conservation strategies critical for halting global biodiversity
   declines. Two challenges for developing such strategies are: (1)
   determining species' capacity to survive in production land-uses; and
   (2) understanding why some species can survive, while others cannot. The
   interaction between biological traits of organisms and their response to
   disturbances may assist in resolving these challenges. We compared
   species and trait composition of 41 lowland rainforest birds among
   unlogged and forestry production land-uses on New Britain Island, Papua
   New Guinea. At least 92% of forest species occurred in mature, native
   Eucalyptus plantation and regrown logged forest. However, composition
   changes demonstrated successive loss of some species (medium-and
   large-bodied frugivores, forest specialists) with increasing intensity
   of disturbance, indicating that forestry management practices can affect
   the functional composition of forest birds. In contrast to many
   continental studies where endemism confers susceptibility to
   disturbance, we found endemic island species widely distributed across
   all land-uses, reflecting their capacity for colonizing new
   environments. Ecological traits can help to explain species' responses
   to landscape management, however, the type and intensity of disturbance
   and biogeography of the region affect the traits-disturbance
   interaction. Our study indicates that native plantations may be able to
   assist with biodiversity conservation while providing production values,
   but only if they are judiciously managed in concert with unlogged and
   regrown logged forest reserves.

AB In a challenging contemporary context of isolation and inequality,
   inhabitants of small Pacific islands have employed a variety of
   strategies to ensure that their livelihoods are both secure and
   sustainable. On the outer island of Aniwa, subsistence activities still
   constitute the basis of island life but are complemented by an
   increasingly diverse mix of cash-generating livelihood practices.
   Different motivations and constraints, including access to natural,
   physical, financial, social and human capital, affect the composition
   and success of household livelihood portfolios. Despite the significant
   inequality in household cash incomes on Aniwa, traditional sharing and
   exchange relationships between households on the island and between
   island and migrant households ensure sufficient food and shelter for all
   villagers. Rather than being a one-way drain on the island's skills and
   income-generation potential, the constant flows of people, money and
   goods between the home island and migration destinations sustain the
   outer-island community and its diasporas. Aniwa thus exemplifies how
   diversification and migration can provide a basis for sustainable and
   resilient island livelihoods.

   specimens. Morphospecies richness of Auchenorrhyncha, Cicadomorpha,
   Fulgoromorpha, Cicadellidae, Cixiidae, and Derbidae also decreased with
   increasing elevation but abundance decline was not significant due to
   the large number of specimens captured at 200 m relative to those

AB An unprecedented increase in oil palm developments may be underway in
   Papua New Guinea (PNG) through controversial special agricultural and
   business leases (SABLs) covering over two million hectares. Oil palm
   development can create societal benefits, but doubt has been raised
   about whether the SABL developers intend establishing plantations. Here,
   we examine the development objectives of these proposals through an
   assessment of their land suitability, developer experience and capacity,
   and sociolegal constraints. Our review reveals 36 oil palm proposals
   with plantings planned for 948,000 ha, a sevenfold increase over the
   existing planted area in PNG. Based on our criteria, however, we
   estimate that only five plantations covering 181,700 ha might eventuate
   within the foreseeable future. We conclude that most of the developers
   are clearing forest with no intention of cultivating oil palm, and that
   a large-scale land grab is therefore occurring in PNG under the guise of
   oil palm development.

AB The Pacific Islands are vulnerable to climate change and increased risk
   of disasters not only because of their isolated and often low lying
   geographical setting but because of their economic status which renders
   them reliant on donor support. In a qualitative study exploring the
   adaptive capacity of Pacific Island Countries (PICs) across four
   countries, Cook Islands, Fiji, Samoa, and Vanuatu, it was clear that
   traditional coping strategies are consistently being applied as part of
   response to disasters and climate changes. This paper describes five
   common strategies employed in PICs as understood through this research:
   recognition of traditional methods; faith and religious beliefs;
   traditional governance and leadership; family and community involvement;
   and agriculture and food security. While this study does not trial the
   efficacy of these methods, it provides an indication of what methods are
   being used and therefore a starting point for further research into
   which of these traditional strategies are beneficial. These findings
   also provide important impetus for Pacific Island governments to
   recognise traditional approaches in their disaster preparedness and
   response processes.

AB A 2007 earthquake in the western Solomon Islands resulted in a localised
   subsidence event in which sea level (relative to the previous coastal
   settings) rose approximately 30-70 cm, providing insight into impacts of
   future rapid changes to sea level on coastal ecosystems. Here, we show
   that increasing sea level by 30-70 cm can have contrasting impacts on
   mangrove, seagrass and coral reef ecosystems. Coral reef habitats were
   the clear winners with a steady lateral growth from 2006-2014, yielding
   a 157% increase in areal coverage over seven years. Mangrove ecosystems,
   on the other hand, suffered the largest impact through a rapid dieback
   of 35% (130 ha) of mangrove forest in the study area after subsidence.
   These forests, however, had partially recovered seven years after the
   earthquake albeit with a different community structure. The shallow
   seagrass ecosystems demonstrated the most dynamic response to relative
   shifts in sea level with both losses and gains in areal extent at small
   scales of 10-100 m. The results of this study emphasize the importance
   of considering the impacts of sea-level rise within a complex landscape
   in which winners and losers may vary over time and space.

AB On July 17, 1998, an earthquake occurred near the Pacific coast of
   western Papua New Guinea (PNG), and a large tsunami followed. The death
   toll had been the worst from a tsunami in the previous 50 years, with
   over 1,000 persons killed by the 10-m waves. The exact causative
   mechanism of the tsunami had been the subject of considerable debate;
   detailed offshore investigations coupled with analysis of runup patterns
   eventually and convincingly indicated a slump source (e.g., Tappin et
   al. 2001; Synolakis et al. 2002). Since PNG, the tsunami community has
   expended significant energy into examining the state of knowledge
   regarding landslide tsunamis, with a particular hope to determine the
   risk associated with these events. This paper will detail some of these
   recent advances, as well as provide a fundamental background into the
   physics of wave generation by submarine mass movements. Topics to be
   discussed include coupling seafloor motion to the hydrodynamics,
   characteristics of landslide tsunami waves as compared to "traditional"
   subduction earthquake tsunamis, and the behavior of landslide tsunamis
   in shallow water.

AB Wunderpus photogenicus n. gen. and n. sp. is a spectacular long-armed
   species that occurs on soft sediment habitats in shallow waters (
   typically less than 20 m deep) in Indo-Malayan waters. It is
   characterized by small eyes on elongate stalks, a long, conical papilla
   over each eye and a dramatic and fixed color pattern of white bars and
   spots over a brown-red background. The distribution of the species is
   centered in the Indo-Malayan Archipelago and extends from Vanuatu to
   Papua New Guinea, Indonesia and Malaysia, north to the Philippines.
   Animals typically emerge at dusk and dawn to forage in the twilight,
   primarily catching small crustaceans and fishes by flaring the arms and
   webs over patches of sand or coral rubble to trap enclosed ( and
   typically buried) prey. The species also extends its arms into holes to
   probe for potential prey. The distinctive color pattern of this species
   is most pronounced when the octopus is disturbed or threatened by real
   or perceived attackers. It appears to be a warning display and may
   represent one of two scenarios: either 1) it warns that the octopus is
   directly toxic or venomous by nature or; 2) it represents impersonations
   of toxic or venomous creatures with similar color patterns which
   co-occur in the same habitat. The new genus and species is compared
   with, and distinguished from, other long-armed octopuses.

AB The volatile constituents of cocoa liquor and the differences between
   cocoa liquors from different origins were studied. Direct solvent
   extraction-solvent assisted flavor evaporation and gas
   chromatography-olfactrometry-mass spectrometry in conjunction with aroma
   extract dilution analysis were used to identify the key flavor compounds
   in five cocoa liquors. There were significant differences of specific
   compounds between cocoa liquor from different areas of origins. Then,
   the purge and trap method was used to gathering the aroma-active
   components of five cocoa liquors from different origins, and one
   internal standard was used during this process for the further
   quantitative analysis by gas chromatography-olfactrometry-mass
   spectrometry. The results indicated that 3-methylbutanal, acetic acid,
   tetramethylpyrazine, and 3-methylbutanoic acid were the components with
   high concentrations. The contents of most compounds in the five kinds of
   cocoa liquor were dramatically different. The content of odorants of
   cocoa liquors from Papua New Guinea was higher than that of the others
   and that from Indonesia was the lowest. For sensory evaluation, the
   overall odor outlines of the five cocoa liquors were very similar, the
   Papua New Guinea cocoa liquor had higher preference than those of the
   other four samples. Principal component analysis showed that the
   characteristics of cocoa liquor from Papua New Guinea, Indonesia, and
   Ivory Coast were very significant.

AB [1] Satellite observations show that large-scale phytoplankton blooms
   (increases in chlorophyll) occurred in the equatorial Pacific in 1998,
   2003, and 2005, following termination of the three most recent El Nino
   events. The occurrence of blooms following successive El Nino events
   cannot be explained by local enhancement of vertical nutrient flux, as
   evidenced by observations of equatorial winds, thermocline depth, and
   the depth and strength of the Equatorial Undercurrent (EUC, which
   supplies the limiting nutrient iron to the euphotic zone). However, near
   the peak of each El Nino event (late in 1997, 2002, and 2004), while the
   thermocline of the western equatorial Pacific was anomalously shallow,
   the flow of the New Guinea Coastal Undercurrent (NGCUC, which is the
   primary source of iron-enriched waters to the EUC) intensified, and its
   core shoaled from > 200 m to similar to 100 m depth. Analysis of NGCUC
   variability using a high-resolution, terrain-following three-dimensional
   ocean circulation model simulation indicates that as the NGCUC shoals
   and intensifies, it develops meanders and eddies that augment coupling
   of the New Guinea shelf and upper slope to the EUC. We hypothesize that
   these changes in NGCUC circulation during El Nino enhance iron transport
   from the New Guinea margin into the EUC and thereby trigger large-scale
   blooms when iron-enriched waters subsequently reach the euphotic zone
   along the equator. The threefold to fourfold chlorophyll increases over
   large regions, up to similar to 5 x 105 km(2), must have profound
   impacts on the equatorial ecosystem and biogeochemical cycles.

AB Aim The long-term stability of coastal ecosystems such as mangroves and
   salt marshes depends upon the maintenance of soil elevations within the
   intertidal habitat as sea level changes. We examined the rates and
   processes of peat formation by mangroves of the Caribbean Region to
   better understand biological controls on habitat stability.
   Location Mangrove-dominated islands on the Caribbean coasts of Belize,
   Honduras and Panama were selected as study sites.
   Methods Biological processes controlling mangrove peat formation were
   manipulated (in Belize) by the addition of nutrients (nitrogen or
   phosphorus) to Rhizophora mangle (red mangrove), and the effects on the
   dynamics of soil elevation were determined over a 3-year period using
   rod surface elevation tables (RSET) and marker horizons. Peat
   composition and geological accretion rates were determined at all sites
   using radiocarbon-dated cores.
   Results The addition of nutrients to mangroves caused significant
   changes in rates of mangrove root accumulation, which influenced both
   the rate and direction of change in elevation. Areas with low root input
   lost elevation and those with high rates gained elevation. These
   findings were consistent with peat analyses at multiple Caribbean sites
   showing that deposits (up to 10 m in depth) were composed primarily of
   mangrove root matter. Comparison of radiocarbon-dated cores at the study
   sites with a sea-level curve for the western Atlantic indicated a tight
   coupling between peat building in Caribbean mangroves and sea-level rise
   over the Holocene.
   Main conclusions Mangroves common to the Caribbean region have adjusted
   to changing sea level mainly through subsurface accumulation of
   refractory mangrove roots. Without root and other organic inputs,
   submergence of these tidal forests is inevitable due to peat
   decomposition, physical compaction and eustatic sea-level rise. These
   findings have relevance for predicting the effects of sea-level rise and
   biophysical processes on tropical mangrove ecosystems.

AB Chickens have been in Papua New Guinea since the time of the

   new types of poultry were introduced. Chicken keeping slowly spread but
   only recently into the highlands. From the late 1960s through the 1980s,
   serious attempts were made to improve village poultry production through
   the distribution of dual-purpose chickens and Muscovy ducks. together
   with suggestions on improved husbandry. No real attempt was made to
   improve the husbandry of native village chickens. Most of this activity
   had little obvious impact resulting in a hiatus in activities throughout
   the 1990s. Concern for food security and protein supply for village
   households. particularly in remote areas with few economic
   opportunities, has led to a renewed interest in non-commercial poultry
   production. A workshop convened by the National Agricultural Research
   Institute in August 1999, identified serious gaps in knowledge and
   suggested some possibilities for action.

AB Coral diseases are taking an increasing toll on coral reef structure and
   biodiversity and are important indicators of declining health in the
   oceans. We implemented standardized coral disease surveys to pinpoint
   hotspots of coral disease, reveal vulnerable coral families and test
   hypotheses about climate drivers from 39 locations worldwide. We
   analyzed a 3 yr study of coral disease prevalence to identify links
   between disease and a range of covariates, including thermal anomalies
   (from satellite data), location and coral cover, using a Generalized
   Linear Mixed Model. Prevalence of unhealthy corals, i.e. those with
   signs of known diseases or with other signs of compromised health,
   exceeded 10% on many reefs and ranged to over 50% on some. Disease
   prevalence exceeded 10% on 20% of Caribbean reefs and 2.7% of Pacific
   reefs surveyed. Within the same coral families across oceans, prevalence
   of unhealthy colonies was higher and some diseases were more common at
   sites in the Caribbean than those in the Pacific. The effects of high
   disease prevalence are potentially extensive given that the most
   affected coral families, the acroporids, faviids and siderastreids, are
   among the major reef-builders at these sites. The poritids and agaricids
   stood out in the Caribbean as being the most resistant to disease, even
   though these families were abundant in our surveys. Regional warm
   temperature anomalies were strongly correlated with high disease
   prevalence. The levels of disease reported here will provide a
   much-needed local reference point against which to compare future
   change.

   40degreesS) is first described using Fourier's analysis. The region
   usually has low chlorophyll concentration, except near New Zealand.
   Seasonal variations are small. The main pattern of seasonal variation is
   a maximum in austral winter between 20degreesS and 40degreesS when
   cooling of surface waters reduces the vertical stability of the water
   column and favors the supply of nutrients from below, and subsequent
   phytoplankton growth. Some areas have high interannual variability, such
   as the surface waters near the equator that were affected by the 1997-98
   El Ni (n) over tildeo, and had abnormally high pigments concentration
   when conditions returned to normal, and the region from Vanuatu to Fiji
   Islands where sporadic blooms of Cyanobacteria Trichodesmium are known
   to occur. Field data collected quarterly along the track of a merchant
   ship are used to characterize the phytoplankton populations in this
   region. Indeed, it is recognized that different phytoplankton
   populations may have different impact on the geochemistry of the ocean,
   such as the Coccolithophorids that carry out both biocalcification and
   photosynthesis, thus reducing the alkalinity of seawater, or
   Trichodesmium that use atmospheric N-2 to fulfill its nitrogen
   requirements and thus is not dependent on inorganic nitrogen sources.
   Cells counts and pigments determinations show that the phytoplankton
   populations are dominated by the picoplankton (Prochlorococcus,
   Synechococcus and picoeucaryotes). High numbers of Synechococcus have
   sometimes been found Near New Zealand.

AB Simple theory gives that the depth-integrated flow between the Pacific
   and Indian Oceans, on interannual timescales and longer, is driven by
   the integral of the wind stress along a line from the northern tip of
   Papua-New Guinea across the equatorial Pacific, south along the South
   American west coast, westward across the South Pacific at the latitude
   of the southern tip of Australia, and northward along the west coast of
   Australia.  Evaluation of this integral using ECMWF/JMA 1000-mb wind
   data for the decade 1980-89 yields an interdecadal and interannual
   signal.  The interannual signal peaks in 1981 and 1985, then decreases
   sharply through the ensuing ENSO events.  The variations are chiefly
   attributable to variations in the integral of wind stress across the
   midlatitude line in the South Pacific.  The presence of the shallow
   sills within the Indonesian seas will partially block the midlatitude
   contribution, but local baroclinic adjustment over the sills will reduce
   the blocking effect and produce a corresponding interannual variation in
   upper-layer transport through the seas.  Two mechanisms by which
   variations in throughflow magnitude could contribute to warm water
   pileup in the west Pacific are proposed.

TI Traditional Preparations and Methanol Extracts of Medicinal Plants from

AB The hypothesis underlying this current work is that fresh juice
   expressed from Papua New Guinea (PNG) medicinal plants (succus) will
   inhibit human Cytochrome P450s (CYPs). The CYP inhibitory activity
   identified in fresh material was compared with inhibition in methanol
   extracts of dried material. Succus is the most common method of
   traditional medicine (TM) preparation for consumption in PNG. There is
   increasing concern that TMs might antagonize or complicate drug therapy.
   We have previously shown that methanol extracts of commonly consumed PNG
   medicinal plants are able to induce and/or inhibit human CYPs in vitro.
   In this current work plant succus was prepared from fresh plant leaves.
   Inhibition of three major CYPs was determined using human liver
   microsomes and enzyme-selective model substrates. Of 15 species tested,
   succus from 6/15 was found to inhibit CYP1A2, 7/15 inhibited CYP3A4, and
   4/15 inhibited CYP2D6. Chi-squared tests determined differences in
   inhibitory activity between succus and methanol preparations. Over 80%
   agreement was found. Thus, fresh juice from PNG medicinal plants does
   exhibit the potential to complicate drug therapy in at risk populations.
   Further, the general reproducibility of these findings suggests that
   methanol extraction of dried material is a reasonable surrogate
   preparation method for fresh plant samples.

AB Despite the fact that Manus Province is the most geographically isolated
   province of Papua New Guinea, research shows that the acculturation
   process, common among minority indigenous groups around the globe, has
   had detrimental effects on maintaining knowledge and customs. Analysis
   of ethnobotanical knowledge among the indigenous population of Manus was
   undertaken in an attempt to compare, contrast, and draw conclusions
   regarding factors in maintaining indigenous knowledge of the local
   flora. Four levels of knowledge (plants recognized, identified,
   identified as useful, and identified as medicinally useful) were used to
   examine the relationships between knowledge of the local flora and
   physical, geographical, and social variables of informants. Results
   showed significant differences in ethnobotanical knowledge based on
   informant gender, age, cultural subclass, and habitation locality. Low
   levels of medicinal plant knowledge were found among the Manus due to
   acculturation, supporting the theory that medicinal plant knowledge is
   particularly vulnerable to loss.

   diabetes and hypertension, conditions highly prevalent in the British
   African Caribbean population.
   In this paper, information not previously available is provided on the
   dietary habits and foods consumed by a British African-Caribbean
   population representative of the local community. Food frequency
   questionnaires were obtained from 255 randomly selected subjects in
   Manchester (78% of Jamaican origin), the nutrient intake results of
   which are available elsewhere. Here, suggestions are given to ensure
   that complete and valid dietary assessments (by diet history) are
   obtained, and the need for the approach to be somewhat different to that
   used in the White European population, highlighted with examples.
   Suggestions have also been listed for methods of dietary modification
   for obesity, diabetes and hypertension, taking into account differences
   in cultural understanding and food practices. People of Caribbean origin
   are not from just one territory: food habits and cultural context play
   an important role in every island, with clear differences between each
   which persist in first and later generations in Britain. In this paper,
   we attempt to integrate experience of learning from patients themselves
   during consultations and from participants in this study, with direct
   quantitative data on types of foods and their frequency in the local
   African-Caribbean diet.

AB The trade-offs involved in allocating carotenoid pigments and food to
   healing and regrowing damaged caudal fin tissue v. other functions were
   examined in guppies Poecilia reticulata, a species in which females
   prefer males that display larger amounts of carotenoids in their skin.
   The guppies were derived from four natural populations in Trinidad that
   differed in resource availability but not predation intensity.
   Carotenoids, food and site of origin did not affect either absolute or
   relative fin regrowth, which suggested that fin regeneration in guppies
   was not constrained by carotenoid availability. It is possible that
   carotenoid intake influences fin regeneration in the presence of natural
   stressors such as predators. There was a significant negative
   interaction between food level in the laboratory and resource
   availability in the field: males from low-resource-availability sites
   regrew more fin tissue when raised on the high food level, and males
   from high-resource-availability sites regrew more fin tissue when raised
   on the low food level. The direction of this interaction runs counter to
   theoretical expectations.

AB The diversity of deep-water corals in the Caribbean Sea was studied
   using records from oceanographic expeditions performed by the R/V
   Pillsbury. Sampled stations were sorted according to broad depth ranges
   and ecoregions and were analyzed in terms of species accumulation
   curves, variance in the species composition and contributions to alpha,
   beta and gamma diversity. According to the analysis of species
   accumulation curves using the Chao2 estimator, more diversity occurs on
   the continental slope (200-2000 m depth) than on the upper continental
   shelf (60-200 m depth). In addition to the effect of depth sampling,
   differences in species composition related to depth ranges were
   detected. However, the differences between ecoregions are dependent on
   depth ranges, there were fewer differences among ecoregions on the
   continental slope than on the upper continental shelf. Indicator species
   for distinctness of ecoregions were, in general, Alcyonaria and
   Antipatharia for the upper continental shelf, but also the
   scleractinians Madracis myriabilis and Cladocora debilis. In the
   continental slope, the alcyonarian Placogorgia and the scleractinians
   Stephanocyathus and Fungiacyathus were important for the distinction of
   ecoregions. Beta diversity was the most important component of gamma
   diversity in the Caribbean Basin. The contribution of ecoregions to
   alpha, beta and gamma diversity differed with depth range. On the upper
   continental shelf, the Southern Caribbean ecoregion contributed
   substantially to all components of diversity. In contrast, the northern
   ecoregions contributed substantially to the diversity of the Continental
   Slope. Strategies for the conservation of deep-water coral diversity in
   the Caribbean Basin must consider the variation between ecoregions and
   depth ranges.

AB The influence of teleconnections on the Intra-Americas Sea (IAS; Gulf of
   Mexico and Caribbean Sea) has been mostly analyzed fromthe perspective
   of El Nino-SouthernOscillation (ENSO) on the Caribbean Sea (the latter
   being an extension of the tropical North Atlantic). This emphasis has
   overlooked both 1) the influence of other teleconnections on the IAS and
   2) which teleconnections affect the Gulf of Mexico climate variability.
   In this study the different fingerprints that major teleconnection
   patterns have on the IAS during boreal spring are analyzed. Indices of
   teleconnection patterns are regressed and correlated to observations of
   oceanic temperature and atmospheric data from reanalyses and
   observational datasets. It is found that the Pacific teleconnection
   patterns that influence the IAS SSTs do so by affecting the Gulf of
   Mexico in an opposite manner to the Caribbean Sea. These analyzed
   Pacific climate patterns are the Pacific-North American (PNA)
   teleconnection, the Pacific decadal oscillation (PDO), and ENSO. The
   North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) is related to a lesser degree with the
   north-south SST anomaly dipole than are Pacific teleconnection patterns.
   It is also found that the IAS influence from the midlatitude Pacific
   mostly affects the Gulf of Mexico, whereas the influence fromthe
   tropical Pacific mostly affects the Caribbean Sea. Therefore, the
   combination of a warm ENSO event and a positive PNA event induces a
   strong IAS SST anomaly dipole between the Gulf of Mexico and the
   Caribbean Sea during spring.
   By calculating an index that represents the IAS SST anomaly dipole, it
   is found that the dipole forms mostly in response to changes in the
   air-sea heat fluxes. In the Gulf of Mexico the dominant mechanisms are
   the air-sea differences in humidity and temperature. The changes in
   shortwave radiation also contribute to the dipole of net air-sea heat
   flux. The changes in shortwave radiation arise, in part, by the
   cloudiness triggered by the air-sea differences in humidity, and also by
   the changes in the convection cell that connects the Amazon basin to the
   IAS. Weaker Amazon convection (e. g., in the event of a warm ENSO event)
   reduces the subsidence over the IAS, and henceforth the IAS cloudiness
   increases (and the shortwave radiation decreases). This study
   contributes to a greater understanding of how the IAS is influenced by
   different Pacific and Atlantic teleconnections.

AB The diversity and biomass of sponges on Caribbean reefs exceeds that of
   all other benthic organisms. Wilkinson & Cheshire (1990; Mar Ecol Prog
   Ser 67: 285-294) summarized evidence that sponge communities on
   Caribbean reefs were different from those on the Great Barrier Reef,
   Australia, reflecting food limitation of the latter, but not of the
   former. Since then, we have learned much about the ecology of sponges,
   and the concept of food limitation has recently re-emerged, seemingly
   without substantive reference to past inter-oceanic comparisons or
   pioneering studies of sponge physiology. Here, we review the literature
   in an attempt to correct this digression. Based on current knowledge of
   sponge nutrition and bottom-up resource gradients (particulate food,
   dissolved organic carbon [DOC], light, turbulence), we predict 4
   patterns of sponge abundance that would suggest food limitation on
   Caribbean reefs. After a critical review of survey data, correlative
   studies and manipulative experiments, we can find no evidence for food
   limitation. Although there is good evidence for higher availability of
   picoplankton at greater depths, sponge abundance does not mirror this
   gradient, suggesting that other sources of nutrition are also important,
   and particulate food is not a limiting factor. Recent studies have
   renewed interest in the uptake of DOC by both high and low microbial
   abundance sponge species, suggesting that the absence of bottom-up
   effects for sponges on Caribbean reefs may be attributable to this
   mysterious, and likely ubiquitous, food source. The recent unambiguous
   demonstration of top-down effects of predation on sponge community
   composition across the Caribbean may owe its clarity to the relative
   lack of confounding influences of abiotic and bottom-up effects in this
   study system.

AB Kava (Piper methysticum Forst F.), or awa in the Hawaiian language, has
   been used for thousands of years by the people of the South Pacific
   Islands, in particular Fiji, Vanuatu, Tonga, and Samoa, for social and
   ceremonial occasions. Kava has the unique ability to promote a state of
   relaxation without the loss of mental alertness. Kava recently became
   part of the herbal pharmacopoeia throughout the United States and Europe
   because of its anxiolytic properties. The active compounds are
   collectively called kavalactones (or kava pyrones). The need for a less
   time-consuming and costly method to determine the concentration of
   kavalactones in dried kava is urgent. The combination of near-infrared
   reflectance spectroscopy (NIRS) and partial least-squares (PLS) methods
   has been found to be a convenient, versatile, and rapid analytical tool
   for determination of kavalactones in dried kava powder. Calibration
   equations were developed based on the analyses of 110 samples with
   variable physical and chemical properties collected over time from
   Hawaii kava growers and validated by analyses of a set of 12 samples
   with unknown kavalactones concentration. All six major kavalactones and
   the total kavalactones were measured using NIRS with accuracy acceptable
   for commercial use. The NIRS measurements are reproducible and have a
   repeatability on a par with HPLC methods.

AB Aim
   To document long-term rates of immigration, extinction and turnover in
   insular ant faunas and evaluate the relative impacts of recent hurricane
   activity and climate change.
   Location
   Small islands in the Exuma Cays, Andros and Abaco archipelagos of the
   Bahamas.
   Methods
   I surveyed the ant faunas of > 140 small islands in three archipelagos
   of the Bahamas over several multi-year periods, spanning up to 17 years,
   by recording species attracted to baits. Immigrations, extinctions and
   species turnover were documented, as were the relative abundances of
   species. Four major hurricanes affected the study archipelagos in the
   second decade of this study.
   Results
   Rates of ant turnover were generally low among archipelagos and time
   periods. Immigrations outnumbered extinctions in the first decade of
   this study, although this pattern was reversed in the second decade.
   General physical characteristics of the islands were not significant
   predictors of the occurrence of extinctions. The relative abundance
   (based on proportion of baits occupied) of persistent populations of the
   two most common species both declined in the second decade, indicating,
   along with higher extinction rates, a generalized decline in these
   insular ant faunas.
   Main conclusions
   The available evidence suggests that hurricanes were not directly
   responsible for the observed declines in the ant faunas. Regional
   changes in insular ant species richness, however, are correlated with
   generalized North Atlantic hurricane activity over the last half
   century. Indirect effects of hurricanes on the vegetation of these
   islands, such as increased herbivory and possible decreased nutrient
   availability, along with a long-term (quarter century) increase in
   temperature and decline in rainfall, are possible contributing factors
   to the changing ant turnover dynamics.

   DNA from 482 individuals collected around the world, to determine the
   efficacy of barriers to gene flow and to ascertain the history of
   possible dispersal and vicariance events that led to speciation. We also
   compared 22 isozyme loci between all described species except D.
   palmeri. The mitochondrial DNA data show that the two deepest lineages
   are found in the Indian and West Pacific Oceans. (Indo-Pacific) Diadema
   setosum diverged first from all other extant Diadema, probably during
   the initiation of wide fluctuations in global sea levels in the Miocene.
   The D. setosum clade then split 3-5 million years ago into two clades,
   one found around the Arabian Peninsula and the other in the Indo-West.
   Pacific. On the lineage leading to the other species of Diadema, the
   deepest branch is composed of D. palmeri. apparently separated when the
   climate of New Zealand became colder and other tropical echinoids at
   these islands went extinct. The next lineage to separate is composed of
   a currently unrecognized species of Diadema that is found at Japan and
   the Marshall Islands. Diadema mexicanum in the eastern Pacific separated
   next, whereas D. paucispinum. D. savignyi, and D. antillarum from the
   western and central Atlantic, and (as a separate clade) D. antillarum
   from the eastern Atlantic form a shallow polytomy. Apparently,
   Indo-Pacific populations of Diadema maintained genetic contact with
   Atlantic ones around the southern tip of Africa for some time after the
   Isthmus of Panama was complete. Diadema paucispinum contains two
   lineages: D. paucispinum sensu stricto is not limited to Hawaii as
   previously thought, but extends to Easter Island, Pitcairn, and Okinawa;
   A second mitochondrial clade of D. paucispinum extends from East Africa
   and Arabia to the Philippines and New Guinea. A more recent separation
   between West Indian Ocean and West Pacific populations was detected in
   D. setosum. Presumably, these genetic discontinuities are the result of
   water flow restrictions in the straits between northern Australia and
   Southeast Asia during Pleistocene episodes of low sea level. Diadema
   savignyi is characterized by high rates of gene how from Kiribati in the
   central Pacific all the way to the East African Coast. In the Atlantic,
   there is a biogeographic barrier between the Caribbean and Brazil,
   possibly caused by fresh water outflow from the Amazon and the Orinoco
   Rivers. Diadema antillarum populations of the central Atlantic islands
   of Ascension and St. Helena are genetically isolated and
   phylogenetically derived from Brazil. Except for its genetic separation
   by the mid-atlantic barrier, Diadema seems to have maintained
   connections through potential barriers to dispersal (including the
   Isthmus of Panama) more recently than did Eucidaris or Echinometra, two
   other genera of sea urchins in which phylogeography has been studied.
   Nevertheless, the mtDNA phylogeography of Diadema includes all stages
   expected from models of allopatric differentiation.
   There are anciently separated clades that now overlap in their
   geographic distribution, clades isolated in the periphery of the genus
   range that have remained in the periphery, clades that may have been
   isolated in the periphery but have since spread towards the center,
   closely related clades on either side of an existing barrier, and
   closely related monophyletic entities on either side of an historical
   barrier that have crossed the former barrier line, but have not attained
   genetic equilibrium. Except for D. paucispinum and D. savignyi, in which
   known hybridization may have lodged mtDNA from one species into the
   genome of the other, closely related clades are always allopatric, and
   only distantly related ones overlap geographically. Thus, the
   phylogenetic history and distribution of extant species of Diadema is by
   and large consistent with allopatric speciation.

AB The remarkable swarming of black triggerfish Melichthys niger
   (Balistidae) on oceanic islands led us to undertake a comparative
   ecological study of high-density and low-density populations of this
   unusual circumtropical species. Abundance, distribution, and aggressive
   encounters were recorded in the field from the high-density Johnston
   Atoll (JA) population, the low-density Belize (BE) population, and a
   local high-density aggregation from Puerto Rico (PR). JA and PR
   populations of M. niger occurred at significantly higher densities and
   were more aggregated than in BE. Intraspecific aggression
   (chases/min/fish) was an order of magnitude higher in BE than in JA,
   while interspecific aggression was similar among sites. Size frequency,
   growth rate, diet composition, body condition (liver-somatic index LSI)
   were assessed from collected specimens. JA grew more slowly than BE as
   determined by back-calculations from dorsal spine rings, suggesting
   density-dependent growth limitation. Size frequency analysis reflected
   this difference with significantly more large fish in the BE sample.
   Maximum age of triggerfish in both populations was estimated at 11
   years, and 35-40% of growth occurred in the first year. Diet composition
   was similar in all three locations and indicated broad omnivory. Percent
   organic composition of gut contents (food quality measure) and LSI (body
   condition assay) were both significantly higher in the PR population,
   but no difference was detected between JA and BE. An increase in
   consumption of algae on the degraded PR reef may explain this pattern.

AB The drinking water qualities in three countries in the South Pacific
   Islands, namely Fiji, Tonga and Kiribati, were examined due to the
   deteriorating water quality. This paper reports the uses of the seeds of
   the local plant Moringa oleifera and a few other local seeds, such as
   peanuts (Arachis hypogaea), cowpeas (Vigna unguiculata), urad (Vigna
   mungo) and corn (Zea mays) for their effectiveness in water
   clarification as natural coagulants in water treatment in the South
   Pacific.
   Moringa oleifera seeds contain proteins that have active coagulation
   properties and are being used for turbidity removal in many countries.
   The quality of the treated water was analyzed and experiments were
   conducted. on different dosages of Moringa oleifera seeds.
   Determinations of pH, turbidity, hardness as calcium and magnesium,
   heavy metals and nutrient levels were conducted before and after
   treatment with Moringa oleifera and other seeds. In this study, Moringa
   seeds were found to be better than the other seeds in turbidity removal
   and had greater potential for water purifications than the other seeds
   tested. The use of the local Moringa seeds for clarification is
   therefore useful in the purification of drinking water in developing
   countries, since other chemicals used in water purification are
   expensive.

PD AUG 2016
PY 2016
AB Fishing is widely considered a leading cause of biodiversity loss in
   marine environments, but the potential effect on ecosystem processes,
   such as nutrient fluxes, is less explored. Here, we test how fishing on
   Caribbean coral reefs influences biodiversity and ecosystem functions
   provided by the fish community, that is, fish-mediated nutrient
   capacity. Specifically, we modelled five processes of nutrient storage
   (in biomass) and supply (via excretion) of nutrients, as well as a
   measure of their multifunctionality, onto 143 species of coral reef
   fishes across 110 coral reef fish communities. These communities span a
   gradient from extreme fishing pressure to protected areas with little to
   no fishing. We find that in fished sites fish-mediated nutrient capacity
   is reduced almost 50%, despite no substantial changes in the number of
   species. Instead, changes in community size and trophic structure were
   the primary cause of shifts in ecosystem function. These findings
   suggest that a broader perspective that incorporates predictable impacts
   of fishing pressure on ecosystem function is imperative for effective
   coral reef conservation and management.

AB Land mammals of the Caribbean Islands biodiversity hotspot have suffered
   a high rate of extinction since human arrival, principally in the last
   500 years since colonialism began. Here, we present an extensive review
   and bibliography of this topic in Cuba, including details regarding the
   surviving endemic species of volant and terrestrial mammals and
   locations of species on 121 protected areas. We analyzed patterns of
   species richness, endemism, body mass, diet, habitat, geographic
   distribution of the observed richness, conservation threats, and
   possible causes and threats to future extinction. Cuban mammal
   biodiversity is comprised of 59 native species, 24 extinct species and
   35 extant species, most of which are endemic to the Cuban archipelago.
   We compared the threats of habitat destruction and hunting, with
   emphasis on invasive mammal species as drivers of historical extinction
   in Cuba. A total of 44 mammal species have been introduced since 1509,
   with 33 invasive species living in the wild and exerting differing
   degrees of impact, principally by predation and competition.
   Additionally, we evaluated interactions among invasive and native
   mammals, emphasizing predation of feral cats upon Solenodon cubanus,
   Capromys pilorides, and other small endemic vertebrates as determined
   from analyses of scat contents. We found that black rats (Rattus rattus)
   reach densities of 147-322 individuals/ha in Solenodon habitat, thus
   likely are major competitors for food and refuges to these
   evolutionarily distinct and endangered Cuban mammals.

AB The agriculture industry is significantly exposed to the impacts of
   climate change, and is also responsible for contributing extensive
   greenhouse gas emissions. As a way of responding to both adaptation and
   mitigation challenges within the industry, this article examines how
   community-based climate change adaptation initiatives might provide
   mitigation outcomes in the agriculture sector in Timor-Leste. Beginning
   with an exploration of nation-wide institutional responses to climate
   change, the study utilises interviews, field observations and document
   analysis to examine an extensive community-based adaptation program in
   two districts in Timor-Leste focused on increasing the resilience of the
   agriculture sector and the livelihoods of poor rural farmers. Analysis
   of this program reveals a largely synergistic relationship between
   adaptation measures focused on land and water management and agriculture
   and their corresponding greenhouse gas mitigation potential, including
   co-benefits such as soil/atmospheric carbon sequestration, reduced
   emissions, soil nitrification and reduced use of inorganic fertilisers.
   Community-based adaptation programs in the agriculture sector have a
   significant influence on mitigation outcomes, which is often overlooked
   in community-based programs. The adaptation program in Timor-Leste has
   provided useful insights into the inter-relationships between adaptation
   and mitigation at the community level, which could be further supported
   and scaled-up in other Southeast Asia countries and elsewhere.

AB Forest degradation is a major driver of the global biodiversity
   declines. However, responses to forest degradation vary greatly between
   taxa and are predominantly understudied. This study investigates the
   effects of land-use change on the endemic amphibian fauna of Sao Tome
   Island (Central Africa), where a fast-growing human population increases
   pressure on forest resources. We sampled acoustic data on reed frog
   (Hyperolius spp.) abundance at eight transects in each of four land-use
   categories, representing different levels of forest degradation:
   old-growth forest, secondary forest, agroforest, and horticulture. While
   Hyperolius molleri was most abundant in secondary forest and
   horticulture, Hyperolius thomensis was almost exclusively found in
   agroforest. We interpret these differences based on reproductive traits,
   since both species deposit terrestrial eggs and have aquatic larvae, but
   reproduce in different microhabitats. H. molleri utilizes open water
   bodies bordered by vegetation for calling and oviposition, which human
   disturbance has made available in secondary forest and horticulture. In
   contrast, H. thomensis breeds in water-filled tree holes (phytotelmata),
   which predominantly occurred in agroforest, often within coral trees
   (Erythrina spp.). This first study on Santomean amphibian abundances
   revealed that H. molleri and H. thomensis males exhibit distinct
   nonlinear responses to forest degradation and may reap some benefit from
   human habitat alteration. However, despite their apparent tolerance to
   some anthropogenic disturbance, further land-use intensification may
   reduce overall habitat suitability for these and other endemic species.

AB Ciliate epibionts inhabit aquatic systems globally and may exert
   negative impacts on their hosts. Evidence of the environmental drivers
   of these epibionts is lacking. This study aimed to test the effects of
   turbidity on the attachment success of the ciliate Epistylis sp. on the
   copepod Pseudodiaptomus stuhlmanni in the turbid St Lucia Estuary, South
   Africa. Epistylis sp. was exposed to P. stuhlmanni individuals for 24 h
   under six turbidity treatments (range 8-1,500 NTU). The prevalence and
   density of Epistylis sp. exposed to inorganic silt decreased
   significantly across the turbidity range in both runs of this
   experiment. In the natural silt treatments, prevalence increased with
   turbidity up to 500 and 250 NTU in the first and second experiment,
   respectively. Beyond these peaks, prevalence decreased. Density peaked
   at 250 NTU in both experiments. High prevalence and density in the
   natural silt experiments is directly related to the high organic matter
   content in this treatment. Association of Epistylis sp. with turbidity
   may impact negatively P. stuhlmanni, as the longevity of this copepod is
   negatively related to heavy cover by Epistylis sp. and to turbidity.
   These findings show that environmental factors may play a key role in
   modulating epibiotic interactions.

   half of the cases reported in 2012 were in the Western Hemisphere,
   predominantly Haiti. Since the current epidemic began in Haiti in 2010,
   there has been spread to the Dominican Republic, Cuba, and most recently
   Mexico. Several recent case reports document individuals returning home
   from affected areas with diarrhea from cholera, in some cases severe.
   Hopeful news reported the containment of an outbreak through the use of
   a Vibrio cholera vaccine. There are safe and effective oral cholera
   vaccines available and recommended in outbreaks and endemic areas,
   although they are not currently available in the USA or to travelers.
   This review aims to discuss the latest data to aid our current
   recommendations for the prevention of cholera in travelers beyond
   standard personal and food hygiene precautions for the prevention of
   travelers' diarrhea and to offer insights on the most current data

AB Marine ecological services provide goods, amenities, food resources, and
   economic benefits to millions of people globally. The loss of these
   services, attributed to the infiltration of marine invasive species such
   as the Indo-Pacific lionfish (Pterois volitans/miles), is measurable.
   The highly successful lionfish now flourishes in great densities in the
   US Gulf of Mexico and Atlantic waters and the entire Caribbean, yet the
   loss of ecological services attributed to the invader has not yet been
   assessed. In this study, we employ a derivative of a well-utilized
   method of ecosystem valuation known as habitat equivalency analysis to
   measure the time-value-adjusted loss of biomass- and recruitment-related
   ecosystem services brought by lionfish to Bahamian reefs. Drawing upon
   the literature examples of tangible lionfish damages in the Bahamas, we
   (1) quantitatively evaluate the loss of ecosystem services instigated by
   lionfish by measuring the total service-year losses partitioned over
   yearly time steps, (2) provide a metric by which ocean managers may
   value the remunerations of Bahamian lionfish controls when weighed
   against removal costs, and (3) deliver a tool to quantify changes in
   ecosystem services as a consequence of invasive species impacts and
   control. We found that the invader imposed losses of 26.67 and 21.67
   years to recruitment and biomass services per km(2) of Bahamian reef if
   left uncontrolled. In the same accord, the most conservative Bahamian
   lionfish removal regime modeled, i.e., which produced a 50 % recovery of
   pre-lionfish ecosystem function over 10 years, provided service gains of
   9.57 and 4.78 years per km(2). These data deliver a platform upon which
   to quantify present and future fiscal costs of the lionfish invasion and
   also to value lionfish control efforts.

AB The annual precipitation pattern in the Caribbean basin shows a distinct
   bimodal behavior, where the first mode is called the Early Rainfall
   Season (April-July), and the second mode the Late Rainfall Season
   (August-November). The brief, relatively dry, period in July is usually
   referred to as the midsummer drought (MSD). It has been hypothesized
   that the migration through the Caribbean basin of the Intertropical
   Convergence Zone (ITCZ) and increases in aerosols due to the passing of
   Saharan Dust across the Caribbean in the summer months may result in the
   observed precipitation pattern. This paper focuses on determining the
   origins of the Caribbean MSD. Multiple regression analysis was
   carried-out to determine if the ITCZ, the North Atlantic Oscillation
   (NAO) index, the Vertical Wind Shear (VWS), and different atmospheric
   particle (AP) concentrations transported from northern Africa correlate
   with the Caribbean MSD. It is shown that the ITCZ and NAO are weakly
   correlated with the Caribbean precipitation variability; however, the
   VWS and aerosol particles revealed an important contribution to rainfall
   during the summer months. Numerical experiments were then performed to
   quantify the influence of different VWS scenarios and different AP
   concentrations on the Caribbean precipitation bimodal behavior. The
   numerical approach uses the Regional Atmospheric Modeling System coupled
   with a new cloud microphysics module that allows discrimination between
   small and giant particles, as well as Cloud Concentration Nuclei (CCN)
   and Giant CCN activation. These numerical experiments support the
   statistical result that the VWS and the AP influence the rainfall
   production and pattern during the MSD. Results indicate that cloud
   microphysics play an important role in producing the observed
   climatological bimodal pattern, while variations in large-scale
   atmospheric dynamics (like the VWS) help explain variations in the
   strength and pattern of the bimodal events and behavior.

AB Volcanic CO2 seeps were successfully used to predict coral reef response
   to ocean acidification, although toxic elements, often characteristic of
   hydrothermal vents were rarely reported. We measured the physicochemical
   conditions, seawater carbonate chemistry and trace elements in Tutum
   Bay, Papua New Guinea. There, intense emission of hydrothermal fluids
   and CO2 expose the coral reef to a seawater pH(T) between 7.6 and 7.7.
   Arsenic and silica were enriched by up to six times in surface seawater,
   while bottom concentrations were lower and thus similar to coral reefs
   worldwide. Manganese, cesium, iron and zinc concentrations fell into the
   range of other coastal environments. Our measurements suggest that Tutum
   Bay is a suitable site to study the response of coral reefs to high
   pCO(2). Considering that arsenic is a common metal in hydrothermal
   fluids, its characterization should be included in any study that uses
   volcanic CO2 seeps as natural laboratories for ocean acidification.

AB To identify forests of high priority for conservation in tropical dry
   forests of New Caledonia, Fiji, the Marquesas and Hawaii, we examined
   patterns of woody plant species richness (total, native and endemic) and
   threatened species (IUCN categorization and density) at the stand level,
   using Gentry's transect method. There were associations between total,
   native and endemic plant species richness in all four Pacific dry forest
   regions but we found no significant association with the presence or
   density of species listed on the IUCN Red List. Dry forests in New
   Caledonia and Hawaii merit the highest conservation priority in the
   Pacific, based on level of endemism and number of threatened species.
   The study sites that merit high conservation priority are Metzdorf,
   Nekoro and Pindai, in New Caledonia, Kokee and Kaupulehu, in Hawaii, and
   Vatia, in Fiji. New Caledonia and Fiji have a small dry forest extent
   and protected area extent compared with other dry forests in
   biodiversity hotspots. Although we identified priority areas for dry
   forest conservation, more comparative plot data, presence/absence data
   in fragments and regional geographical data are needed to adequately
   manage and protect dry forests in the Pacific.

AB To explore the seasonal to decadal variability in surface water masses
   that contribute to the Indonesian throughflow, we have generated a
   115-year bimonthly coral-based radiocarbon time series from a coral in
   the Makassar Straits. In the pre-bomb (pre-1955) era from 1890 to 1954,
   the radiocarbon time series occasionally displays a small seasonal
   signal (10-15%). After 1954 the radiocarbon record increases rapidly, in
   response to the increased atmospheric 14 C content caused by nuclear
   weapons testing. From 1957 to 1986 the record displays clear seasonal
   variability from 15 to 60% and the post-bomb peak (163 per mil) occurred
   in 1974. The seasonal cycle of radiocarbon can be attributed to
   variations of surface waters passing through the South Makassar Strait.
   Southern Makassar is under the influence of the Northwest Monsoon, which
   is responsible for the high austral summer radiocarbon (North Pacific
   waters) and the Southeast Monsoon that flushes back a mixture of low
   (South Pacific and upwelling altered) radiocarbon water from the Banda
   Sea. The coral record also shows a significant (14)C peak in 1955 due to
   the bomb-(14)C water advected into this region from nuclear weapons
   tests in the Marshall Islands in 1954.

AB Reef habitats of the tropical Atlantic are separated by river outflows
   and oceanic expanses that may preclude larval dispersal or other
   population connections in shorefishes. To examine the impact of these
   habitat discontinuities on the intraspecific phylogeography of
   reef-associated species we conducted range-wide surveys of two
   amphi-Atlantic reef fishes that have dispersive pelagic larval stages.
   Based on 593 bp of mtDNA cytochrome b from the rock hind Epinephelus
   adscensionis and 682 bp from the greater soapfish Rypticus saponaceous
   (n=109 and 86, respectively), we found evidence of relatively ancient
   separations as well as recent surmounting of biogeographic barriers by
   dispersal or colonization. Rock hind showed slight but significant
   population genetic differentiation across much of the tropical Atlantic
   Ocean (Phi(ST)=0.056), but deep divergence between the southeastern
   United States and seven other localities from the Bahamas to the south,
   central and east Atlantic (mean pairwise d=0.040, overall
   Phi(ST)=0.867). The geographic distribution of the two rock hind
   lineages is highly unusual in genetic studies of Caribbean Sea reef
   fishes, because those lineages are separated by less than 250 km of open
   water within a major biogeographic region. In contrast, highly
   significant population genetic structure was observed among greater
   soapfish from the SW Caribbean, Brazil, and mid-Atlantic ridge
   (Phi(ST)=0.372), with a deep evolutionary separation distinguishing
   putative R. saponaceous from West Africa (mean pairwise d=0.044, overall
   Phi(ST)=0.929). Both species show evidence for a potential connection
   between the Caribbean and Brazilian provinces. While widespread
   haplotype sharing in rock hind indicates that larvae of this species
   cross oceanic expanses of as much as 2000 km, such a situation is
   difficult to reconcile with the isolation of populations in Florida and
   the Bahamas separated by only 250 km. These findings indicate that
   populations of some species in disjunct biogeographic zones may be
   isolated for long periods, perhaps sufficient for allopatric speciation,
   but rare gene flow between zones may preclude such evolutionary
   divergence in other species.

   the Orinoco and Amazon rivers, and is therefore expected to be an area
   of high species diversity. However, concerning the study of molluscs,
   Venezuela is probably the poorest known region in the Caribbean. The
   best compilation of opisthobranch species known in Venezuela was
   produced almost a decade ago, mentioning the occurrence of 57 species,
   plus seven determined only to genus level. In this work, 134 species are
   reported for Venezuela (71 are illustrated), representing about 40 % of
   the entire diversity of opisthobranchs known in the Caribbean. Among the
   species occurring in Venezuela, 49 have here the southern limit of their
   distribution range and only one the northern limit. Forty-six species
   are recorded for the first time to the country and one is a new record
   for the Caribbean Sea, namely Placida cremoniana. In addition, the
   distribution and ecology of the species are given based in literature
   and new data.

   species of Rhaphidhistia (Demospongiae, Hadromerida, Trachycladidae) a
   genus previously thought to be restricted to the Indo-Pacific Ocean.
   Rhaphidhistia guajiraensis sp. nov. is thickly encrusting, agglutinating
   bottom debris; it possesses asymmetric oxea as megascleres (465-757m by
   6.3-17.5m) and spiraster-like spinispirae (15-37m by 2-5m). It is
   closely similar to the type species of the genus, R. spectabilis Carter,
   1879, both standing apart from a third species, R. mirabilis (Dendy,
   1924), thus conforming a natural group whose taxonomic placement needs
   to be reassessed. There are numerous cases of sponge genera with sister
   species in the Indo-Pacific and the Atlantic Oceans, possibly split
   since the Tethys Sea breakup; owing to their restricted or deep
   distribution, they are just starting to be discovered.

AB Analysis of data measured by the NASA Langley airborne High Spectral

   The HSRL is a dual wavelength polarized system (1064 and 532 nm) with
   the inclusion of a molecular backscatter channel at 532 nm. Data from
   aircraft flights over the Pamlico Sound out to the Atlantic Ocean, over
   the Caribbean west of Barbados, and off the coast of Barrow, Alaska are
   evaluated. Analysis of the data demonstrates that the molecular channel
   detects the presence of water due to its ability to differentiate the
   Brillouin-Mandelshtam spectrum, i.e. the scattering spectrum of water,
   from the Rayleigh/Mie spectrum. The characteristics of the lidar
   measurements over water, land, ice, and mixed ice/water surfaces are
   examined. Correlations of the molecular channel lidar signals with
   bathymetry (ocean depth) and extraction of attenuation from the HSRL
   lidar measurements are presented and contrasted with ocean color data.

   Specimens of two nominal species, Sterreria psammicola and Nemertinoides
   elongatus from 33 locations worldwide were sequenced for three molecular
   markers. Species delimitation and validation was done using gene trees,
   haplotype networks and multilocus Bayesian analysis. We found 20
   supported species of which nine: Nemertinoides glandulosum n. sp., N.
   wolfgangi n. sp., Sterreria boucheti n. sp., S. lundini n. sp., S.
   martindalei n. sp., S. monolithes n. sp., S. papuensis n. sp., S.
   variabilis n. sp. and S. ylvae n. sp., are described including
   nucleotide-based diagnoses. The distribution patterns indicate
   transoceanic dispersal in some of the species. Sympatric species were
   found in many cases. The high level of cryptic diversity in this
   meiofauna group implies that marine diversity may be higher than
   previously estimated.

AB The biology of Kick'em Jenny (KEJ) Submarine volcano, part of the Lesser
   Antilles volcanic arc and located off the coast of Grenada in the
   Caribbean Sea, was studied during a cruise in 2003. Hydrothermal venting
   and an associated biological assemblage were discovered in the volcanic
   crater (similar to 250 in depth). Warm water with bubbling gas emanated
   through rock fissures and sediments. Shrimp (some of them swimming) were
   clustered at vents, while other individuals lay immobile on sediments.
   The shrimp fauna consisted of 3 mesopelagic species that had no prior
   record of benthic or vent association. We suggest that these midwater
   shrimp, from deeper water populations offshore, were trapped within the
   crater during their downward diel vertical migration. It is unknown
   whether they then Succumbed to the hostile vent environment (immobile
   individuals) or whether they are potentially opportunistic vent
   residents (active individuals). Given the abundance of submarine arc
   volcanoes worldwide, this phenomenon suggests that volcanic arcs could
   be important interaction sites between oceanic midwater and vent
   communities. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The presence and diversity of free-living dinoflagellates belonging to
   the endosymbiotic genus Symbiodinium were explored in seawater samples
   collected above coral reefs in Kane'ohe Bay, O'ahu, Hawai'i, and Puerto
   Morelos, Quintana Roo, Mexico. Two genetic markers were used to assess
   Symbiodinium diversity in the water column: the internal transcribed
   spacer 2 region of the nuclear ribosomal array (ITS2), and a
   hypervariable region in domain V of the large subunit (23S) of the
   chloroplast ribosomal array (cp23S-HVR). Sequencing of cloned gene
   fragments reveals that clades B, C, D, and H Symbiodinium are detectable
   in the seawater samples. In addition to the previously described types
   B1, C3, C15, C21, and D1, novel Symbiodinium sequences belonging to
   clades B and C were also retrieved. The majority of Symbiodinium
   sequences recovered from Kane'ohe Bay belonged to clade C and those from
   Puerto Morelos to clade B, a pattern that reflects the dominant types of
   Symbiodinium found in endosymbiosis with scleractinian corals in these
   two areas. This study represents the first direct assessment of
   Symbiodinium diversity in waters adjacent to coral reefs located in the
   Caribbean and the Pacific and confirms the presence of Symbiodinium in
   this compartment of the ecosystem. These data provide context for future
   studies examining spatial and temporal patterns in the availability of
   Symbiodinium in the water column, work that will ultimately promote a
   greater understanding of the interactions between symbiotic
   dinoflagellates and their environmentally sensitive benthic hosts.

AB The investigation of social inequality in the Caribbean mainly has
   focused on the larger islands of the Greater Antilles where
   ethnohistoric records and monumental architecture form the basis for
   analysis of precolumbian complex societies. This paper presents evidence
   for status differentiation in the Lesser Antilles on the small island of
   Anguilla within a deposit at the Sandy Hill site and evaluates
   associated archaeofauna for evidence of rank-based differences in food
   consumption. When compared with three other sites, the higher density of
   status-related artifacts and higher densities of food remains at the
   Sandy Hill site are interpreted as the result of feasting. No evidence
   for inequality is observed in patterns of food consumption.

AB Cyanobacteria blooms in marine waters are limited to only a few taxa
   with Trichodesmium, Richelia, Nodularia, and Aphanizomenon being most
   commonly observed. Nonheterocystous, nitrogen-fixing Trichodesmium spp.
   are found throughout low and mid-latitude oceans and seas of the
   Atlantic, Pacific, and Indian Oceans, and this genus is thought to be a
   major contributor to new nitrogen influx into these nitrogen-poor
   systems. Heterocystous, nitrogen-fixing Richelia and other cyanobacteria
   form unique symbioses with the centric diatoms, Rhizosolenia and
   Hemiaulus, in the North Pacific, Caribbean, and North Atlantic.
   Heterocystous, diazotrophic, toxic Nodularia spumigena is restricted to
   brackish waters of the Baltic Sea and a coastal estuary of southern
   Australia and often arises from elevated phosphorus input accompanying
   anthropogenic activities or vertical mixing processes. The nontoxic
   nitrogen-fixing Aphanizomenon flos-aquae is also common in the Baltic,
   often co-occurring with Nodularia in the Baltic and Gulf of Finland but
   more often found in lower salinity areas of the region. Although each
   taxon responds to its environment uniquely, it appears that bloom
   production in the three free-living cyanobacteria largely supports an
   active microbial food web through dissolved organic compound Aux to
   heterotrophic bacterial communities and their grazers.

AB The tiger shrimp (Penaeus monodon) is an Indo-Pacific species. Its
   global production between 1970 and 1980 exceeded all other shrimp
   species, which favored its introduction and cultivation outside its
   natural range in several countries of Africa, Europe, USA and South
   America. It is currently found in the coast of the Atlantic Ocean
   (Mexico, United States, Puerto Rico, Brazil, Guyana, Venezuela and
   Colombia). Despite the risk involved, no studies have been conducted to
   evaluate their impact as a possible invasive species and their genetic
   condition. This study evaluated the genetic status and population origin
   of P. monodon in the northernmost Colombian Caribbean, analyzing the
   mitochondrial DNA control region (mtDNA-CR). 16 individuals were
   randomly collected from Golfo de Salamanca and 342 original Indo-Pacific
   sequences were obtained from GenBank. Parameters of genetic diversity
   and genetic relationships were analyzed. These results were a total of
   358 sequences compared and 303 haplotypes identified. Three haplotypes
   were identified in the Colombian population. This results showed lower
   genetic diversity compared with Indo-Pacific populations. These
   haplotypes were closely related to those found in samples from the
   Philippines and Taiwan. We discuss the need to create a regional network
   to characterize the established populations in the Great Caribbean, with
   the purpose of inferring colonization processes and the establishment of
   management measures.

AB To persist in oligotrophic waters, reef-building corals rely on
   nutritional interactions with symbiotic dinoflagellates of the family
   Symbiodiniaceae, but the true diversity of this family remains poorly
   characterised. In this paper, we assess Symbiodiniaceae richness at
   Atauro Island (Timor-Leste) as well as on reefs of the neighbouring
   Timor mainland, using direct sequencing of three gene regions: cob gene,
   mitochondrion; ITS2 region, nucleus; and psbA(ncr) region, chloroplast;
   in addition to a highly multiplexed application of next-generation
   sequencing. These geographic sites are among the most biodiverse in the
   world, but have never had their symbiont communities studied. Despite
   their proximity, our results reveal symbiont richness 1.25 times higher
   at Atauro Island than the Timor mainland, a result evident in dominant
   sequences. In contrast, Timor had a significantly richer background
   sequence diversity. Although sampling was restricted to shallow sites
   only, symbiont richness at Atauro Island was also higher than
   comparative reefscapes globally, after standardising for number of taxa
   sampled. While Atauro and Timor have related symbiont populations, with
   the same novel types recorded at both sites, there were also clear
   differences in symbiont composition between the two geographic regions,
   with Timor displaying a consortium more characteristic of stressed reef
   environments (proportionally hosting twice as many Durusdinium
   sequences, formerly clade D, as Atauro). These results reveal a symbiont
   richness that matches the high biodiversity of these reefs, but also
   potentially negative effects of proximal human populations on
   Symbiodiniaceae, even when previous studies have shown corals to be
   largely unaffected.

AB Species invasions are a significant threat to global biodiversity and
   ecosystem function, and yet our knowledge of consequences for native
   species remains poor. The problem is exacerbated in highly speciose
   ecosystems like coral reefs. The invasion of the wider Caribbean by
   predatory lionfish (Pterois spp.) is one of the most successful marine
   colonizations ever documented, and its impact is anticipated to be
   substantial on native species. However, despite the ecological and
   commercial importance of iconic Nassau grouper (Epinephelus striatus),
   the impacts of the invasion on this IUCN Red-Listed species remain
   unexamined. Using data gathered from two critical habitats in the
   Bahamas, we investigate isotopic niche space overlap between lionfish,
   Nassau grouper and putative prey species. Despite their relatively small
   body size, we find that lionfish occupy the highest isotopic niche
   position on patch reefs, occupying much of the same space as the native
   apex predator. Contrary to expectation, lionfish trophic level (delta
   N-15) does not increase with body size, contrasting with confamilials in
   their native range. However, we find that tissue carbon (delta C-13)
   changes systematically with body size on deep forereef habitats,
   representing a length-specific shift in food resources, with smaller
   individuals partitioning resources from larger individuals in this
   habitat but not on shallow patch reefs. We conclude that, despite the
   difference in body size, lionfish are capable of directly competing for
   food resources with Nassau grouper, and that impacts on guilds such as
   planktivores and invertivores may vary systematically by habitat. Our
   study contributes to the growing body of research aimed at understanding
   how a species that is relatively rare in its native range achieved the
   most successful fish invasion ever documented.

AB Beach cusps have attracted the focus of several studies due to their
   effect on sediment transport and their rhythmic presence in the midst of
   complex nearshore interactions among waves, currents and sediment. In
   this paper, cusp evolution is investigated to determine the factors
   which influence them within Maracas Bay, Trinidad, in the micro-tidal
   environment of the southern Caribbean. Data on beach profiles, beach
   sediment, coastal processes, and cusp dimensions were collected using
   standard geomorphological techniques across daily, weekly and seasonal
   time-scales. Results indicate that beach cusp dimensions are
   predominantly determined by beach volume and beach angle. These two
   parameters in turn are influenced by wave energy. In both the wet and
   dry seasons, periods of lower wave energy promote accretion, leading to
   the formation of smaller beach cusps; conversely, periods of higher wave
   energy and the associated increase in erosion result in the formation of
   larger beach cusps. There was agreement with the self-organization
   theory since cusps were always present along the beach, constantly
   changing morphologically but never completely being erased and recreated
   anew. Beach cusps form an integral part of the total sediment deposited
   and retained on beaches over tidal and seasonal cycles, with
   implications for nearshore currents and beach safety. As such, a proper
   understanding of their dynamics will help support planning and
   management of beaches as they go through cyclic phases annually.

AB Zooplankton samples were collected on a four-month schedule (February,
   March, May, August 1991) off the eastern coast of the Yucatan Peninsula,
   westernmost portion of the Caribbean Sea. Taxonomic analysis of the
   pelagic Copepoda yielded 89 species, Undinula vulgaris, Temora
   turbinata, and Farranula gracilis being the overall dominant forms. They
   represented more than 60% of the copepod numbers during the four months
   surveyed. The faunistic influence of the surface Caribbean water was
   evident during the entire period in the surveyed area. Mean diversity
   was moderate and did not show relevant month-to-month variations during
   the surveyed period. Station clustering with the Bray-Curtis Index
   suggests the absence of a definite coast-ocean gradient in the local
   copepod community, stations being sorted mainly by density differences.
   Coastal species were recorded well inside the oceanic zone, and oceanic
   and even mesopelagic forms occurred very near the coast or over the
   shelf. These effects may result from continuous mixing of coastal and
   shelf waters with oceanic water because of (1) the narrowness of the
   continental shelf off the Mexican Caribbean coast, and (2) the effect of
   local mesoscale circulation patterns. It is suggested that these
   processes favour the homogeneity of the local copepod community.

AB Local ecological knowledge has filled baseline gaps in conservation
   biology, providing important information that has contributed to
   resource management policies both on land and at sea. Marine ecosystems
   are globally threatened by overfishing, yet we know little on if and how
   fishers perceive changes in fisheries composition through time. This is
   particularly important in developing nations where people rely on
   fishery resources as their main source of food and income. We
   interviewed 178 artisanal fishers to collect information regarding their
   perceptions on the trends and composition of reef fisheries in Sao Tome
   and Principe islands, a marine biodiversity hotspot. In addition, we
   investigated the relative contribution of the possible factors causing
   changes in these reef fish assemblages according to fished perceptions.
   Of six reef fish species assessed, five exhibited significant declining
   catch trends. We found a declining trend in individual body size for
   targeted species based on reports from older (mean +/- S.E. = 43.3 2.6
   kg) and younger (21.0 +/- 0.7 kg) fishers' generations. Generations also
   differed in their perceptions of declines over time, all of the very
   experienced fishers reported decline, while only one-third of
   inexperienced fishers did so. The main causes for fish catch changes
   identified by experienced fishers (> 40 years of fishing practice) were
   the increasing number of fishers (25%), destructive fishing practices
   (mainly blast fishing) (18%) and industrial fishing (29%). Our results
   suggest the occurrence of the shifting baseline syndrome phenomena among
   traditional fishers and provide baseline information for the
   conservation and management of Sao Tome and Principe marine ecosystems.

AB This study investigates climatological, seasonal, and interannual
   variability in chlorophyll concentration (Chl) throughout the Gulf of
   Mexico (GM), the western Caribbean Sea (WC), and the Bahamas (BI). For
   this purpose, Coastal Zone Color Scanner (CZCS) (1979-1986), Ocean Color
   and Temperature Scanner (OCTS) (1996-1997), and Sea-Viewing Wide
   Field-of-View Sensor (SeaWiFS) (1997-2008) NASA climatology, yearly, and
   seasonal Level-3 Standard Mapped Image series were used. Inspection of
   the original Chl and the obtained fuzzy unsupervised classified maps
   show the existence of a transition zone between the already known
   coastal and open waters. The extension (total number of pixels) and form
   of polygons representing these water masses vary both annually and
   seasonally, showing their greatest differences during spring and autumn
   in the northeastern and northwestern GM, Campeche Sound, and the
   Honduras coast in the Caribbean. In contrast, the BI present polygons
   having an almost invariant extension and form. The seasonal averaged Chl
   values up to 0.8mgm(-3) present a cyclic variation, showing the highest
   Chl during winter months and the lowest Chl during summer months,
   independent of the basin or the sensor under consideration. The CZCS and
   OCTS products must be considered with care; however, they provide
   results that are compatible with findings from the SeaWiFS time series.
   Annual and winter/autumn trends - a decrease in Chl - were identified in
   the GM and BI. The Caribbean reports constant Chl values during the two
   periods under study. Possible interpretations of these trends will come
   from detailed interpretation of local data.

AB The Atlantic warm pool ( AWP) is a large body of warm water that
   comprises the Gulf of Mexico, the Caribbean Sea, and the western
   tropical North Atlantic. Located to its northeastern side is the North
   Atlantic subtropical high ( NASH), which produces the tropical easterly
   trade winds. The easterly trade winds carry moisture from the tropical
   North Atlantic into the Caribbean Sea, where the flow intensifies,
   forming the Caribbean low-level jet ( CLLJ). The CLLJ then splits into
   two branches: one turning northward and connecting with the Great Plains
   low-level jet ( GPLLJ), and the other continuing westward across Central
   America into the eastern North Pacific. The easterly CLLJ and its
   westward moisture transport are maximized in the summer and winter,
   whereas they are minimized in the fall and spring. This semiannual
   feature results from the semiannual variation of sea level pressure in
   the Caribbean region owing to the westward extension and eastward
   retreat of the NASH.
   The NCAR Community Atmospheric Model and observational data are used to
   investigate the impact of the climatological annual mean AWP on the
   summer climate of the Western Hemisphere. Two groups of the model
   ensemble runs with and without the AWP are performed and compared. The
   model results show that the effect of the AWP is to weaken the
   summertime NASH, especially at its southwestern edge. The AWP also
   strengthens the summertime continental low over the North American
   monsoon region. In response to these pressure changes, the CLLJ and its
   moisture transport are weakened, but its semiannual feature does not
   disappear. The weakening of the easterly CLLJ increases ( decreases)
   moisture convergence to its upstream ( downstream) and thus enhances (
   suppresses) rainfall in the Caribbean Sea ( in the far eastern Pacific
   west of Central America). Model runs show that the AWP's effect is to
   always weaken the southerly GPLLJ. However, the AWP strengthens the
   GPLLJ's northward moisture transport in the summer because the
   AWP-induced increase of specific humidity overcomes the weakening of
   southerly wind, and vice versa in the fall. Finally, the AWP reduces the
   tropospheric vertical wind shear in the main development region that
   favors hurricane formation and development during August-October.

AB Anolis lizards (anoles) are textbook study organisms in evolution and
   ecology. Although several topics in evolutionary biology have been
   elucidated by the study of anoles, progress in some areas has been
   hampered by limited phylogenetic information on this group. Here, we
   present a phylogenetic analysis of all 379 extant species of Anolis,
   with new phylogenetic data for 139 species including new DNA data for
   101 species. We use the resulting estimates as a basis for defining
   anole clade names under the principles of phylogenetic nomenclature and
   to examine the biogeographic history of anoles. Our new taxonomic
   treatment achieves the supposed advantages of recent subdivisions of
   anoles that employed ranked Linnaean-based nomenclature while avoiding
   the pitfalls of those approaches regarding artificial constraints
   imposed by ranks. Our biogeographic analyses demonstrate complexity in
   the dispersal history of anoles, including multiple crossings of the
   Isthmus of Panama, two invasions of the Caribbean, single invasions to
   Jamaica and Cuba, and a single evolutionary dispersal from the Caribbean
   to the mainland that resulted in substantial anole diversity. Our
   comprehensive phylogenetic estimate of anoles should prove useful for
   rigorous testing of many comparative evolutionary hypotheses.

AB Accurate accounts of both living and fossil mammal communities are
   critical for creating biodiversity inventories and understanding
   patterns of changing species diversity through time. We combined data
   from froml4 new fossil localities with literature accounts and museum
   records to document the bat biodiversity of Haiti through time. We also
   report an assemblage of late-Holocene (1600-600 Cal BP) bat fossils from
   a montane cave (Trouing Jean Paul,-1825m) in southern Haiti. The nearly
   3000 chiropteran fossils from Trouing Jean Paul represent 15 species of
   bats including nine species endemic to the Caribbean islands. The fossil
   bat assemblage from Trouing Jean Paul is dominated by species still
   found on Hispaniola (15 of 15 species), much as with the fossil bird
   assemblage from the same locality (22 of 23 species). Thus, both groups
   of volant vertebrates demonstrate long-term resilience, at least at high
   elevations, to the past 16 centuries of human presence on the island.

AB Nearly half the world's vascular plant species and one-third of
   terrestrial vertebrates are endemic to 25 "hotspots" of biodiversity,
   each of which has at least 1500 endemic plant species. None of these
   hotspots have more than one-third of their pristine habitat remaining.
   Historically, they covered 12% of the land's surface, but today their
   intact habitat covers only 1.4% of the land. As a result of this habitat
   loss, we expect many of the hotspot endemics to have either become
   extinct or-because much of the habitat loss is recent-to be threatened
   with extinction. We used World Conservation Union [IUCN] Red Lists to
   test this expectation. Overall, between one-half and two-thirds of all
   threatened plants and 57% of all threatened terrestrial vertebrates are
   hotspot endemics. For birds and mammals, in general, predictions of
   extinction in the hotspots based on habitat loss match numbers of
   species independently judged extinct or threatened. In two classes of
   hotspots the match is not as close. On oceanic islands, habitat loss
   underestimates extinction because introduced species have driven
   extinctions beyond those caused by habitat loss on these islands. In
   large hotspots, conversely, habitat loss overestimates extinction,
   suggesting scale dependence (this effect is also apparent for plants).
   For reptiles, amphibians, and plants, many fewer hotspot endemics are
   considered threatened or extinct than we would expect based on habitat
   loss. This mismatch is small in temperate hotspots, however, suggesting
   that many threatened endemic species in the poorly known tropical
   hotspots have yet to be included on the IUCN Red Lists. We then asked in
   which hotspots the consequences of further habitat loss (either absolute
   or given current rates of deforestation) would be most serious. Our
   results suggest that the Eastern Arc and Coastal Forests of
   Tanzania-Kenya, Philippines, and Polynesia-Micronesia can least afford
   to lose more habitat and that, if current deforestation rates continue,
   the Caribbean, Tropical Andes, Philippines, Mesoamerica, Sundaland,
   Indo-Burma, Madagascar, and Choco-Darien-Western Ecuador will lose the
   most species in the near future. Without urgent conservation
   intervention, we face mass extinctions in the hotspots.

AB Coral growth rate can be affected by environmental parameters such as
   seawater temperature, depth, and light intensity. The natural reef
   environment is also disturbed by human influences such as anthropogenic
   pollutants, which in Barbados are released close to the reefs. Here we
   describe a relatively new method of assessing the history of pollution
   and explain how these effects have influenced the coral communities off
   the west coast of Barbados. We evaluate the relative impact of both
   anthropogenic pollutants and natural stresses. Sclerochronology
   documents framework and skeletal growth rate and records pollution
   history (recorded as reduced growth) for a suite of sampled Montastraea
   annularis coral cores. X-radiography shows annual growth band patterns
   of the corals extending back over several decades and indicates
   significantly lower growth rate in polluted sites. Results using
   laser-ablation inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (LA-ICP-MS)
   on the whole sample (aragonite, organic matter, trapped particulate
   matter, etc.), have shown contrasting concentrations of the trace
   elements (Cu, Sn, Zn, and Pb) between corals at different locations and
   within a single coral. Deepwater corals 7 km apart, record different
   levels of Pb and Sn, suggesting that a current transported the metal
   pollution in the water. In addition, the 1995 hurricanes are associated
   with anomalous values for Sn and Cu from most sites. These are believed
   to result from dispersion of nearshore polluted water. We compared the
   concentrations of trace elements in the coral growth of particular years
   to those in the relevant contemporaneous seawater. Mean values for the
   concentration factor in the coral, relative to the water, ranged from 10
   for Cu and Ni to 2.4 and 0.7 for Cd and Zn, respectively. Although the
   uncertainties are large (60-80%), the coral record enabled us to
   demonstrate the possibility of calculating a history of seawater
   pollution for these elements from the 1940s to 1997. Our values were
   much higher than those obtained from analysis of carefully cleaned coral
   aragonite; they demonstrate the incorporation of more contamination
   including that from particulate material as well as dissolved metals.

AB The nurse shark is an extremely abundant shallow water species in
   Florida and the Caribbean, yet its biology is poorly known. Moreover,
   there is a great deal of misinformation about it in the literature. The
   maximum size and weight attained by the nurse shark have often been
   exaggerated. None of the specimens measured in this study exceeded 265
   cm TL and 114.5 kg, and none of the specimens actually measured by other
   researchers exceeded 280 cm. Females reach maturity at a length of
   223-231 cm, or at 86% of their maximum size. Males reach maturity
   between 214 and 214.6 cm in length or at about 83% of their maximum
   size. Mating primarily occurs from mid-June to early July. The embryos
   are enclosed in sturdy egg capsules for the first 12-14 weeks of
   gestation. In a gravid female, the embryos are at different stages of
   development during the first four months of gestation. Embryos are
   lecithotrophic and there is no evidence of any supplemental mode of
   embryonic nourishment. Embryos measure 28-30.5 cm at birth. The
   gestation period is estimated at about five to six months. Brood sizes
   are large, ranging from 21 to 50 young, with a median of 34 young. The
   reproductive cycle of the nurse shark consists of a five to six-month
   gestation period and a two-year ovarian cycle. Thus, the reproductive
   cycle is biennial and a female produces a brood every two years. The
   nurse shark is an opportunistic predator that consumes a wide range of
   small fishes, primarily grunts (Haemulidae).

   is the coordinator. First of all, in the team, we have a PhD in African
   Development, specialized in ecological tourism and pursuing the Post
   Doctoral research, two master degrees in African tourism, a MBA and a
   PhD student in environmental issues. The main theoretical background is
   the development alternative approach complemented by the ecological
   tourism concept and the evaluation indicators and methods about the
   impacts of the practice increase in the community life and environment
   balance. Sao Tome e Principe is a small insular and African country in
   development (SIDS). It is an archipelago that is endowed with a
   diversified environmental patrimony where it is possible to identify and
   to classify different protected areas in agreement with the
   international indicators. Some examples are the Natural Park Obo in the
   two main islands (Sao Tome and Principe islands) and the Ecological
   Areas (Malanza and Praia das Conchas), characterized by the biodiversity
   and endemic flora and fauna in the forest, coastal and sea areas. The
   archipelago has many natural potentialities that are adapted to the
   ecological tourism and the observation practice. On the other hand, it
   is a country with abundance of natural resources that are the
   maintenance of the local community who are dependent of the nature to
   guarantee the family survival, developing traditional cultural
   practices, exercising and added load in the environment. In spite of the
   Government considered and recognized officially the importance of the
   ecological segment in 2000, at present in Sao Tome and Principe tourism
   is still a marginal sector. The participation and the local community
   empowerment in the ecological tourism projects with environmental
   preservation had been valued in the last years. Some examples are the
   important societies or partnerships with community groups, local
   associations and Non Governmental Organizations in coastal areas as well
   as in rural context. Because of the importance of the education in the
   development, concerning to make certain the local poverty relief as well
   as the improvement of the community abilities, the care about the
   environment education is real, especially when we analyse the ecological
   tourism experiences. In Sao Tome and Principe it is already visible the
   concern with the environmental education and the formation for the
   nature preservation and the conservation of the threatened animals in
   extinction. Those fragile species have a decisive importance for the
   ecological tourism practice but are a preferred target for the local
   consumption. The target groups of the education actions are both, the
   youth and scholar population as well as the working people like the
   small fisher, the fish sellers and the artisans. The research indicates
   that in Sao Tome and Principe something is changing slowly but it is
   already possible to identify some transformation signs in the local
   people mentality and practices.

AB THE possible impact of pollution from North America and Europe on
   tropospheric ozone throughout the Northern Hemisphere is a major
   environmental concern1-4. We report here continuous measurements of
   ozone from Bermuda (32-degrees-N, 65-degrees-W) and Barbados
   (13-degrees-N, 60-degrees-W), which suggest that despite their proximity
   to the eastern US seaboard, natural processes rather than pollution
   control surface ozone in these regions. Although springtime daily
   average ozone concentrations at Bermuda are greater than 70 parts per
   billion (10(9)) by volume (p.p.b.v.) and hourly values in 1989 sometimes
   exceeded the Canadian Air Quality limit of 80 p.p.b.v., trajectory
   analyses indicate that these high levels of ozone are transported from
   the unpolluted upper troposphere >5 km above the northern United States
   and Canada5. During the summer, when surface ozone concentrations over
   the eastern United States can exceed 70 p.p.b.v. owing to pollution6,
   typical values at Bermuda are between 15 and 25 p.p.b.v. At Barbados,
   both the seasonal and diurnal variations in surface ozone are nearly
   identical to those at Samoa in the tropical South Pacific, where the
   isolation from anthropogenic sources7 and low levels of NO(x) (ref. 8)
   ensure that natural processes control surface ozone9-11.

AB The Australian summer monsoon (ASM) is primarily a synoptic feature
   determined by the differential thermal response to solar insolation
   between the Australian continent and the western Pacific warm pool
   (WPWP) in austral summer. Little is known about the process involved in
   driving long-term ASM variability. Here we present a 180 ka record of
   terrestrial fluxes into offshore southeastern Papua New Guinea (PNG), a
   prevailing monsoon area in the WPWP. Terrestrial fluxes were estimated
   by a 230Th-normalized method, indicating higher terrestrial inputs into
   the ocean during glacial stages. We argue that the higher terrestrial
   fluxes are mainly fluvial, which in turn are linked to stronger ASM
   precipitation on land, though the increased terrestrial flux could
   possibly also be due to the lowstand or glacial erosion of mountain
   glaciers. Cross-spectral analysis indicates that the ASM precipitation
   maxima are controlled by local summer insolation maxima, WPWP
   sea-surface temperature minima and East Asian winter monsoon (EAWM)
   maxima in precession frequency bands (21 ka-1). This result suggests
   that the 21 ka components of the ASM in the past 180 ka are not only
   insolation driven but also a dynamic component strengthened by
   cross-hemispheric pressure gradient resulted from the precession maxima
   forcing. Copyright (c) 2012 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB Sponges are a dominant component of Caribbean coral reef
   suspension-feeding communities. Understanding how pumping rates are
   affected by sponge size and morphology, as well as the environment, is
   fundamental to understanding the ecological interactions that are
   mediated by sponge filtration. In a comprehensive in situ investigation
   of sponge pumping, the excurrent seawater velocities of 274 specimens of
   the largest Caribbean species, the giant barrel sponge Xestospongia
   muta, were measured at sites in the Bahamas and Florida Keys to
   investigate (1) the relationship between excurrent velocity
   distributions and sponge morphology, (2) the scaling relationship
   between pumping and sponge size, and (3) temporal variation of pumping
   and sensitivity to environmental changes. Excurrent velocity
   distributions across the osculum showed peak velocities at the center
   and diminishing velocities near the edges of the osculum. The degree of
   center-weighting was explained by the distribution of sponge biomass
   relative to the spongocoel. Volumetric pumping rates scaled
   isometrically with sponge size and averaged 0.06 +/- 0.04 l s(-1) l(-1)
   sponge tissue, but were reduced for extremely large sponges. Pumping
   activity was relatively constant over short temporal scales, but varied
   over longer scales; however, variations in pumping rates, in cluding
   periods of cessation, were asynchronous across the population and
   uncorrelated with changes in environmental conditions. We estimate that
   populations of X. muta in the Florida Keys and Bahamas process a volume
   of water equivalent to a layer 1.7 to 12.9 m thick each day and overturn
   the water column every 2.3 to 18.0 d.

AB Since the late 1950s, undocumented sightings of seals in the Caribbean
   have been reported. It has been suggested that the Caribbean monk seal
   (Monachus tropicalis) might not be extinct based on circumstantial
   evidence. We provide an explanation for recent sightings of seals in the
   tropical and subtropical Western North Atlantic as we present eight new
   extra-limital records of hooded seals (Cystophora cristata) from North
   Carolina south to the Caribbean. The unexplained behavior of young
   hooded seals straying south of their whelping area may encompass long
   distance movements, extending as far south as the Caribbean. Our records
   provide an unequivocal explanation for pinniped sightings in the
   subtropical and tropical waters of the Western North Atlantic that,
   without definite evidence, such as a specimen or photograph, may have
   been attributed to the extinct Caribbean monk seal.

AB Coral reefs are believed to be one of the most diverse ecosystems, but
   the true magnitude of their biodiversity and patterns of endemism is
   uncertain. This uncertainty stems partly from the relative paucity of
   investigations on the small, difficult to collect taxa (cryptofauna)
   that may make up the majority of reef biodiversity and require
   specialized expertise for morphological identification. To assess the
   extent of diversity in some of the reef micro-cryptofauna, we analyzed
   414 bp of the mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase subunit I gene from 556
   individuals representing two brooding amphipod species (Leucothoe
   ashleyae and Leucothoe kensleyi). These amphipods are commensal inside
   the branching vase sponge Callyspongia vaginalis, and were sampled
   throughout Florida and the Caribbean. Phylogenetic analyses revealed 11
   deeply divergent, strongly supported lineages (seven L. ashleyae and
   four L. kensleyi) each with very narrow geographic ranges. The level of
   intraspecific lineage divergence for both morphospecies was among the
   highest reported for any marine crustacean (12.4-26.0% uncorrected), and
   exceeded that of congeners from nine diverse amphipod families, as well
   as the patristic genetic distance suggested as a threshold for
   crustacean species delineation. These findings suggest a history of
   cryptic speciation within each morphospecies, concomitant with a
   pronounced period of morphological stasis involving each of the
   morphotypes. The observation of multiple, highly divergent, evolutionary
   significant units, each endemic to Florida and Caribbean island
   locations, supports the emerging view that coral reef biodiversity,
   especially in the cryptofaunal component, is likely vastly
   underestimated.

AB Moored current meter observations complimented by
   conductivity-temperature-depth (CTD) profiles and shipboard acoustic
   Doppler current profiler measurements have revealed two distinctly
   different coastal circulation patterns south of the island of Barbados,
   West Indies, in the springs of 1990 and 1991. In the first year an
   abrupt increase in speed and change in direction of the currents south
   of the island was found to be associated with a large, anticyclonic,
   horizontally sheared circulation and a marked variation in
   temperature-salinity characteristics. The shift in currents was also
   accompanied by the incursion of a shallow pool of low-salinity water, a
   strong internal semidiurnal tidal signal, and a change in the location
   of larval fish assemblages west of the island. Rapid variations in
   current speed and direction were also observed in 1991, though less
   persistent than in the previous year. In this year the island was at one
   time completely surrounded by a large, shallow pool of low-salinity
   water. A comparison was made of the 1990 hydrographic observations with
   CTD data from the National Oceanographic Data Center archive for the
   region 0 degrees-20 degrees N, 40 degrees-60 degrees W. This suggests
   that the variation in hydrographic characteristics was due to the
   intrusion of a water mass of North Brazil Current origin which displaced
   the ambient North Atlantic Subtropical Underwater around the island.
   Several recent studies have demonstrated that mesoscale anticyclonic
   eddies formed near the retroflection region of the North Brazil Current
   can be advected toward the eastern Caribbean before being dissipated. It
   is concluded that the most likely cause of the observed high-energy
   event in 1990 was the passage of such an eddy past Barbados.

AB The black-capped petrel Pterodroma hasitata is an endangered seabird
   with fewer than 2000 breeding pairs restricted to a few breeding sites
   in Haiti and the Dominican Republic. To date, use areas at sea have been
   determined entirely from vessel-based surveys and opportunistic
   sightings and, as such, spatial and temporal gaps in our understanding
   of the species' marine range are likely. To enhance our understanding of
   marine use areas, we deployed satellite tags on 3 black-capped petrels
   breeding on Hispaniola, representing the first tracking study for this
   species and one of the first published tracking studies for any breeding
   seabird in the Caribbean. During chick rearing, petrels primarily used
   marine habitats in the southern Caribbean Sea (ca. 18.0 degrees to 11.5
   degrees N, 70.0 degrees to 75.5 degrees W) between the breeding site and
   the coasts of Venezuela and Colombia. Maximum distance from the breeding
   sites ranged from ca. 500 to 1500 km during the chick-rearing period.
   During the post-breeding period, each bird dispersed north and used
   waters west of the Gulf Stream offshore of the mid-and southern Atlantic
   coasts of the USA as well as Gulf Stream waters and deeper pelagic
   waters east of the Gulf Stream. Maximum distance from the breeding sites
   ranged from ca. 2000 to 2200 km among birds during the nonbreeding
   period. Petrels used waters located within 14 different exclusive
   economic zones, suggesting that international collaboration will benefit
   the development of management strategies for this species.

AB Conservation efforts often neglect the importance of monitoring of
   protected areas, which is key to adaptively managing dynamic landscapes.
   In many developing countries, like Trinidad, protected areas are set
   aside as a result of an agreement with an international conservation
   organization, often resulting in inadequate planning and monitoring of
   the protected area. Monitoring of protected areas allows for an
   examination of the conservation scheme implemented and enables improved
   conservation decisions to be made. The research presented provides an
   example of the use of technology in monitoring conservation strategies
   in two protected wetlands, Caroni and Nariva, in Trinidad. Remote
   sensing and fragmentation analyses are used to quantify land cover
   change within these two protected wetlands. Results show that the
   classification of Caroni immediately identifies a shift towards
   anthropogenic land cover types, suggesting an increase in human activity
   within the park, This finding is further supported by the continuous
   measures used, such as decreases in mean NDVI and greenness values
   suggesting a decrease in the amount or health of the vegetation. While
   the classification of Nariva suggests a return to natural land covers,
   the continuous measures of land cover change indicate the opposite. Land
   cover change analyses are limited in Trinidad and in the Caribbean in
   general, partly due to satellite data availability, thus this research
   presents remote sensing and landscape fragmentation analyses as new
   tools for monitoring land cover change and conservation effectiveness in
   Trinidad. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The present study is the first revision of the western Atlantic
   peppermint shrimp complex Lysmata wurdemanni (Gibbes). Lysmata
   wurdemanni, originally described from Florida and South Carolina, is
   redescribed. Gibbes' types of L. wurdemanni are considered as lost,
   therefore, a neotype is selected from specimens collected near Key West,
   Florida. Lysmata rathbunae Chace is rediagnosed; the locality of this
   species is restricted to Florida and Yucatan; Chace's "variety" of L.
   rathbunae is separated from L. rathbunae and assigned to a new species.
   In total, four new species are recognized: Lysmata ankeri n. sp.,
   Lysmata boggessi n. sp., Lysmata pederseni, n. sp. (corresponding to
   Chace's "variety" of L. rathbunae), and Lysmata bahia n. sp.; all four
   previously were mistaken for L. wurdemanni and/or L. rathbunae.
   Classical morphological and morphometrical analyses (Discriminant
   Function Analysis), in conjunction with examination of life color
   patterns and interbreeding experiments, were used to corroborate the
   separation of these cryptic species. Each species may be most easily
   recognized by the unique color pattern. Lysmata pederseni, n. sp. also
   differs ecologically in being associated with tube sponges. Lysmata
   rathbunae appears to be a deep-water species, while the other five
   species are found mostly in shallow waters.

AB The triazine herbicides atrazine (AT) and ametryne (AMET) are used
   extensively in Barbados to control weeds in sugar cane fields. These
   pesticides were monitored in groundwater (the primary source of potable
   water on the island) for the dry seasons of March-June, 1991 and
   January-May, 1992 and the wet season, July-December, 1992. Residues of
   either AT or AMET were detected in all 277 groundwater samples collected
   from 23 wells in three major groundwater catchments underlying heavily
   cultivated sugar cane fields. The concentration of AT and the metabolite
   deethylatrazine (DEAT) were in the range 0.11-2.61 mug/l with the
   highest occurrence in the most heavily cultivated sugar cane area, the
   Hampton catchment. These measured levels of atrazine in the groundwater,
   represent a relatively small fraction that may have leached from the
   annual application, and was estimated to be 0.12, 0.17 and 0.19% of the
   total amount applied to the Belle, Hampton and Western catchments
   respectively. These levels, however, are in general higher than those
   reported for related studies and lower application rates of atrazine in
   sugar cane plantations should be considered to help preserve the quality
   of potable water on the island.

   about 80 mm SL, is described based on 39 specimens collected in
   shallow-water habitats (3-23 m) at Madeira, the Canary Islands, and Sao
   Miguel, Azores, The new species is distinguished from its congeners by
   the combination of a 1-3-2 UD pattern, 12 caudal fin rays, 80-87 dorsal
   fin rays, 66-72 anal fin rays, 45-48 total vertebrae, 84-98 scales in a
   longitudinal series, unpigmented peritoneum, and ocular surface
   pigmentation featuring a yellowish to dark-brown background with a
   series of 3-8 mostly incomplete crossbands and usually 1-3 small, dark,
   spherical spots arranged in a longitudinal row along the body midline,
   together with a series of dark blotches alternating- with unpigmented
   areas on the dorsal and anal fins, and a spot and dark band on the
   caudal fin base with the distal four-fifths of the caudal fin
   unpigmented. Symphurus insularis most closely resembles S. reticulatus
   from St. Helena, S. rhytisma from the Caribbean Sea and northern Brazil,
   and S, lubbocki from Ascension Island. Symphurus insularis is the only
   species of dwarf tonguefish known from shallow-water habitats in the
   Macaronesian biogeographic subprovince of the eastern Atlantic. Pre
   vious reports of other species of symphurine tonguefishes from
   shallow-water habitats in these areas were based on misidentifications,
   A key to species of Symphurus occurring- in middle and eastern Atlantic
   waters is provided.

AB The diversity of introduced mammals and their introduction history
   varies greatly across the Western Indian Ocean (WIO) islands, from
   ancient introductions in the past millennia on islands off the East
   coast of Africa where extant terrestrial native mammal communities
   exist, to very recent invasions in the past decades on islands in the
   Mascarene archipelago. We compile the distribution of 16 introduced
   mammal taxa on 28 island groups comprising almost 2000 islands. Through
   an exhaustive literature review and expert consultation process we
   recorded all mammal eradications, and species recoveries which could be
   attributed to introduced mammal eradication or control. All island
   groups have been invaded by mammals, and invasive cats and rats in
   particular are ubiquitous, but cultural contingency has also led to
   regional invasions by other mammals such as lemurs, civets and tenrecs.
   Mammal eradications have been attempted on 45 islands in the WIO, the
   majority in the Seychelles and Mauritius, and where successful have
   resulted in spectacular recovery of species and ecosystems. Invasive
   mammalian predator eradication or control in association with habitat
   management has led to improved conservation prospects for at least 24
   species, and IUCN red-list down-listing of eight species, in the
   Mascarene Islands. Future island conservation prioritisation in the
   region will need to take account of global climate change and predicted
   sea-level rises and coastal inundation. Greater investment and
   prioritisation in island conservation in the region is warranted, given
   its high biodiversity values and the extent of invasions. (C) 2016 The

AB Video observation of oral gastric eversion in a free-living Caribbean
   reef shark (Carcharhinus perezi) shows voluntary gastric eversion
   followed by retraction not only occurs, but is extremely rapid (lasting
   similar to 0.3 s). Eversion may occur by stomach relaxation-oesophageal
   contraction coupled with increased abdominal pressures to enable
   prolapse, and retraction by a mechanism analogous to suction feeding.
   This behaviour provides a 'cleansing' function for removing indigestable
   food particles, parasites or mucus from the stomach lining. Sharks, and
   possibly other animals with similar gut morphologies, may use this
   technique to helo maintain a healthy alimentary tract.

AB The emergence of the Isthmus of Panama, approximately 3.0-3.5 million
   years ago, established two very different marine systems (the Caribbean
   and the eastern Pacific) and separated previously continuous marine
   populations. The geographic isolation of transisthmian sister species
   provides an excellent basis for the study of divergence and speciation
   processes. Here we describe the morphology of the first postembryonic
   stage of Alpheus saxidomus and A. simus, two rock-boring alpheids; the
   estimated time since divergence for this transisthmian pair ranges from
   4.4-6.1 to 3-9 million years. The presence of a first zoeal stage in A.
   saxidomus, e.g., without pleopods and a telson with 7 + 7 setae,
   indicates a prolonged developmental sequence. In contrast, hatchlings of
   A. simus are substantially more developed and resemble juveniles. Thus,
   the developmental modes of A. saxidomus and A. simus are strikingly
   different with abbreviated, most probably direct, development in the
   latter species. Reduced food availability in the Caribbean compared to
   the Pacific coast is likely to be a possible reason for the evolution of
   such important differences in life history traits of the two
   transisthmian sister species. It is suggested that a transition from
   prolonged to abbreviated development evolved gradually during the
   estimated time since divergence; however, such a shift may have taken
   place within a substantially smaller time span.

AB The assumptions on the host specificity of beetles that led Terry Erwin
   to suggest that there may be over 30 million arthropod species were
   tested for 10 species of trees and their insect associates at a
   rainforest site in Papua New Guinea. The data included 391 species and
   4696 individuals of herbivorous beetles collected during a one year
   period using hand collecting, beating, branch clipping, intercept flight
   traps and pyrethrum knockdown. Insect host specificity was assessed by
   feeding trials in captivity. The data suggest that between 23 and 37
   monophagous leaf-feeding species are most likely to be present in this
   system, whereas Erwin's method yields an estimate of 138 monophagous
   species. The major factors responsible for the discrepancy between our
   observations and Erwin's assumptions appears to be (a) the importance of
   transient species; (b) the insect fauna that is shared among tree
   species; (c) some generalist wood-eating species may innate the apparent
   species richness of leaf-feeding beetles; and (d) the proportion of
   specialist species varies significantly among tree species. We conclude
   that studies reporting the proportion of specialist insect herbivores
   associated with particular tropical tree species will yield only a
   portion of the information needed to estimate global arthropod species
   richness, but may be useful for elucidating certain aspects of food-web
   ecology in tropical rain forests. (C) 1996 The Linnean Society of London

AB Wetlands are biologically important elements of landscapes and among the
   most threatened ecosystems on Earth. On the island of Mauritius, many
   remaining wetlands are being rapidly converted and fragmented by intense
   land-use demands. We surveyed 209 coastal wetlands on Mauritius to
   assess their biophysical attributes, land-use activities, and patterns
   of disturbance, to help identify factors that threaten wetland
   biodiversity. Most wetlands exhibited severe edge-related disturbances
   and more than half were fragmented. Plant species richness was highest
   in larger, unfragmented wetlands and lower in wetlands with degraded
   margins. Urban wetlands were smaller and more likely to be fragmented
   than those adjoining other land uses such as grazing and agriculture.
   Flooding of urban homes and infrastructure was more likely to occur near
   fragmented than natural wetlands. Ongoing wetland decline in Mauritius
   not only contributes to the loss of local biodiversity but reduces the
   larger ecosystem role these habitats play in regulating surface water
   and protecting adjacent marine habitats. (c) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All

AB Understanding spatial and temporal habitat-use patterns to protect both
   foraging and breeding grounds of species of concern is crucial for
   successful conservation. Saona Island in Del Este National Park (DENP),
   south-eastern Dominican Republic (DR), hosts the only major hawksbill
   (Eretmochelys imbricata) nesting area in the DR (100 nests yr(-1), SD =
   8.4, range = 93-111), with the population having been critically reduced
   through hunting. We satellite tracked 9 female hawksbill turtles, and
   present analyses of their core-use areas with respect to Marine
   Protected Areas (MPAs) in both their internesting and foraging areas.
   Kernel utilization distributions indicated that during the internesting
   period all turtles remained close to their nesting beaches in small home
   ranges in the territorial waters of the DR, mostly over the continental
   shelf (< 200 m depth). Common core-use areas were located inside the
   DENP, and 82.7% of all locations were within the DENP. In foraging
   areas, only 23% of locations were inside MPAs, either in waters of the
   DR or in waters of the Bahamas, Nicaragua and Honduras. Our results
   highlight that the protected areas of the DR are vital for hawksbill
   conservation, and the enforcement of existing legislation governing
   protected areas in the country is crucial. The present study also
   corroborates that the waters off Nicaragua and Honduras are
   exceptionally important foraging areas for hawksbills in the Caribbean,
   showing the turtle's vulnerability in these waters.

   is dominated by arthropods, primarily microcrustaceans, insects, and
   mites, with non-arthropod groups including annelids and gastropods. The
   subsurface fauna consists mainly of gastropods and mites and includes
   taxa not found on the surface (e.g. polychaetes). Most of the taxa
   (especially at the genus level) are widespread in occurrence, with very
   few confined to the Lesser Antilles - although the picture could be
   different at the species level. This suggests that the Barbadian
   freshwater fauna is composed largely of cosmopolitan taxa possessing
   generalist and eurytopic traits - exemplified by the fact that many were
   found across the island in a wide range of habitat types. Colonization
   of the island by these invertebrates is likely to have occurred by both
   active and passive means, and involving both natural and human agents.
   This faunal inventory provides an important baseline as the degradation
   (e.g. from increasing saltwater intrusion and nutrient levels) of the
   freshwater habitats on Barbados continues.

AB 1. Development of effective conservation strategies for freshwater
   biodiversity must take account of the trade-off between species
   preservation and human use of ecosystem goods and services. The latter
   cannot be prevented, and attempts to manage ecosystems that focus solely
   on maximizing biodiversity will fail.
   2. A compromise position of management for ecosystem functioning and
   human livelihoods rather than preservation of every species - will
   provide a better basis for biodiversity conservation. This has
   implications for the management of exotic species.
   3. There are some situations, in lentic habitats in Sri Lanka, for
   example, where the establishment of exotics has increased fishery yields
   without apparent detriment to native biodiversity. The Sepik River in
   Papua New Guinea provides another illustration of potential compromises
   between human livelihoods and biodiversity conservation.
   4. The Sepik Supports a relatively unproductive fishery. Two fish
   stocking projects (in 1987-93 and 1993-97), representing a partnership
   between the Papua New Guinea Government and the United Nations
   (UNDP/FAO), led to the introduction of a suite of exotic fish into the
   Sepik. Species were selected on the basis of their potential to occupy
   niches not filled by native fish. Unfortunately, the outcomes of these
   introductions are poorly documented, although there is preliminary
   evidence both of increased human use of exotic fish as well as declines
   of some native species associated with the spread of exotics.
   5. Better understanding of the results of the Sepik fish introductions
   is important, because the pressures of burgeoning human populations in
   most of tropical Asia make it impossible to preserve near-pristine
   environments such as the Sepik. While attempts to conserve natural or
   near-natural systems must remain a priority, there is a need to develop
   strategies for the management of damaged or degraded ecosystems, Which
   may contain exotics, with the aim of maintaining ecosystem functioning
   and, if possible, maximizing the persistence of native biodiversity.

AB Past taxonomic studies of Western Indian Ocean and Red Sea Calcarea have
   been few and sporadic (e.g. Schuffner 1877, Jenkin 1908, Row 1909, Dendy
   1913, 1916, Voigt et al. 2017, 2018). Nevertheless, approximately 70
   species are known from these studies for the considered region, but the
   descriptions of the older records often lack sufficient details for
   reliable identification. We studied the Western Indian Ocean Calcarea
   collection kept in the Naturalis Biodiversity Center. Available
   specimens numbered 145, collected in the Red Sea, Seychelles, Maldives,
   Mayotte and Rodrigues, in addition to incidental samples from Oman, the
   Lakshadweep Islands, the Mozambique Channel, and Eastern South Africa.
   Using a combination of techniques (in situ and 'on deck' photography,
   detailed field notes, light microscopic studies and measurements, SEM
   microscopy, and selected DNA sequencing) we identified 45 species,
   divided over the two main classes Calcinea (24 spp.) and Calcaronea (21
   spp.). Not all species could be definitely assigned to an already
   described or a new species, as seven remained qualified as 'spec.' or
   'aff.' for reasons of insufficient material or lack of details of in
   situ habitus. Sixteen species appeared to be new to science: Borojevia
   voigti sp.nov., Borojevia tubulata sp.nov., Borojevia pirella sp.nov.,
   Clathrina rodriguesensis sp.nov., Clathrina maremeccae sp.nov.,
   Clathrina repens sp.nov., Leucascus schleyeri sp.nov., Leucetta sulcata
   sp.nov., Ute insulagemmae sp.nov., Leucandra pilula sp.nov., Leucandra
   mozambiquensis sp.nov., Grantessa woerheidei sp.nov., Sycettusa
   hirsutissima sp.nov., Vosmaeropsis glebula sp.nov., Paraleucilla
   erpenbecki sp.nov., and Kebira tetractinifera sp.nov. For a selection of
   the identified species from the Western Indian Ocean and the Red Sea (30
   spp.), as well as from Indonesian material (22 spp.) published
   previously (see Van Soest & De Voogd 2015) we obtained sequences of the
   partial 28S gene of nuclear rDNA (C2-D2 region, cf. Voigt & Worheide
   2016). The sequences of the Western Indian Ocean and Red Sea species
   were used to assign these to genera and families based on a phylogenetic
   analysis using MEGA pack vs. 06.6 for Mac of the available dataset. The
   Indonesian sequences supplemented by partial 28S sequences taken from
   the Sponge Barcode Project website and the NCBI website were included in
   the phylogenetic analysis to confirm the assignments. The results were
   compared and discussed with additional information on regional Calcarea
   not represented in our material. The latter chapter yielded the
   discovery of a preoccupied name leading to Sycon oscari nom.nov. for a
   species described from Mauritius.

AB During the Woodlark Basin seismic experiment in eastern Papua New Guinea
   (1999-2000), an ocean-bottom seismic array recorded marine mammal
   vocalizations along with target earthquake signals. The array consisted
   of 14 instruments, 7 of which were three-component seismometers with a
   fourth component hydrophone. They were deployed at 2.0-3.2 km water
   depth and operated from September 1999 through February 2000. While
   whale vocalizations were recorded throughout the deployment, this study
   focuses on 3 h from December 21, 1999 during which the signals are
   particularly clear. The recordings show a blue whale song composed of a
   three-unit phrase. That song does not match vocalization characteristics
   of other known Pacific subpopulations and may represent a previously
   undocumented blue whale song. Animal tracking and source level estimates
   are obtained with a Bayesian inversion method that generates
   probabilistic source locations. The Bayesian method is augmented to
   include travel time estimates from seismometers and hydrophones and
   acoustic signal amplitude. Tracking results show the whale traveled
   northeasterly over the course of 3 h, covering approximately 27 km. The
   path followed the edge of the Woodlark Basin along a shelf that
   separates the shallow waters of the Trobriand platform from the deep
   waters of the basin. (C) 2011 Acoustical Society of America. [DOI:

AB This paper delineates our use of 10 708 km(2) of three-dimensional (3D)
   seismic data from the continental margin of Trinidad and Tobago West
   Indies to describe a series of mass transport complexes (MTCs) that were
   deposited during the Plio-Pleistocene. This area, situated along the
   obliquely converging boundary of the Caribbean/South American plates and
   proximal to the Orinoco Delta, is characterized by catastrophic
   shelf-margin processes, intrusive/extrusive mobile shales and active
   tectonism. Extensive mapping of different stratigraphic intervals of the
   3D seismic survey reveals several MTCs that range in area from 11.3 to
   2017 km(2). Three types of MTCs are identified: (1) shelf-attached
   systems that were fed by shelf-edge deltas whose sediment input is
   controlled by sea-level fluctuations and sedimentation rates; (2)
   slope-attached systems, which occur when upper-slope sediments
   catastrophically fail owing to gas-hydrate disruptions and/or
   earthquakes and (3) locally detached systems, formed when local
   instabilities in the seafloor trigger relatively small collapses. Such
   classification of the relationship between slope mass failures and
   sourcing regions enables a better understanding of the nature of
   initiation, length of development history and petrography of such MTCs.
   3D seismic enables more accurate calculation of deposit volumes,
   improves deposit imaging, and, thus, increases the accuracy of physical
   and computer simulations of mass failure processes.

AB The subsistence strategies of the Lapita populations (3100-2800 BP), the
   first colonisers of the pristine environments of the islands of Eastern
   Melanesia and Western Polynesia, have been a matter of ongoing debate
   for decades. Opinions have ranged between the two extremes of Lapita
   colonisers being either characterised as highly mobile foragers to fully
   horticultural communities. To further address the question, this paper
   presents stable carbon and nitrogen isotopic data obtained from analyses
   of human and animal collagen samples from the site of Teouma (Efate,
   Vanuatu) dated to between c. 3000-2500 BP. The isotopic signatures
   obtained from 28 samples (23 human and 5 animal), interpreted in
   combination with isotopic information from several coastal and insular
   environments, suggest a diet primarily made up of terrestrially derived
   animal protein with lesser contributions from vegetable produce and
   inshore marine species. Comparisons linking the isotopic data gleaned
   from the Teouma individuals and Lapita subsistence patterns
   reconstructed through archaeozoological and archaeobotanical remains
   support the hypothesis of a mixed economy, that included terrestrial
   foraging, inshore marine exploitation and a low level of food production
   for at least some of the earliest Lapita colonists in Vanuatu. (C) 2010

AB In Papua New Guinea (PNG) while rice continues to assume greater
   significance as a staple food within rural communities, root and tuber
   crops are still important staples. The root and tuber crops grown are
   sweet potato (Ipomoea batatas), lesser yam (Dioscorea esculenta),
   greater yam (Dioscorea alata), taro (Colocasia esculenta) and Chinese
   taro (Xanthosoma sagittifolium), cassava (Manihot esculenta) and, to a
   lesser extent, giant taro and swamp taro.
   Root and tuber crops in lowland PNG are still primarily produced by
   subsistence farmers under the traditional method of shifting
   cultivation. In the past this traditional system of cultivation with its
   long forest fallow (more than 15 years), could reliably sustain soil
   fertility lost through leaching, erosion and gardening. In the latter
   half of this century, however, in many lowland areas of the country,
   there has been a rapid shift away from the long forest fallow system
   toward a more sedentary and unstable short bush and grass fallow system.
   This change has come about due to a shortage of land caused by
   population pressure and in some areas the allocation of good arable land
   to plantation crops. The short fallow system with almost continuous
   cultivation of crops and meagre restorative measures has resulted in
   declining yields corresponding to declining soil fertility. This paper
   briefly discusses results of some fertilizer research conducted in
   lowland PNG and some adaptive strategies that have been adopted by
   subsistence farmers in response to declining food crop yields.

AB Surface temperature (Ts), sea-level pressure (SLP), and zonal wind (U)
   fields from NCEP/NCAR reanalysis spanning the period 19492006 have been
   jointly analysed by means of principal component analysis to assess the
   dominant modes of climate variability in the inter-American region,
   including the eastern Pacific and Atlantic Oceans. Two aspects of these
   time-series were analysed: the annual cycle and its residual. Seasonal
   modes 1 and 2 take the form of north-south dipoles of Ts over oceanic
   and terrestrial environments. Seasonal mode 3 derives from SLP changes
   over the Amazon with a Caribbean wind response. Temporal fluctuations in
   the residual (ANOM) fields are resolved by six modes. ANOM13 is
   dominated by SLP and Ts changes across the equator in the Atlantic and
   east Pacific. The ANOM4 pattern is an isolated wind mode in the NE
   Atlantic. ANOM5 and 6 are dominated by sea temperature patterns in the
   South Atlantic and in the path of African easterly waves crossing the
   tropical Atlantic. The residual time scores are marked by significant
   warming (Ts) trends and co-located lower pressure. Cycles in the anomaly
   time scores tend to occur at 2- to 5-year periods. Modes dominated by
   atmospheric variables exhibit greater high-frequency noise than oceanic
   modes. Predictability is assessed through development of multivariate
   regression models trained on Caribbean rainfall and related target
   time-series. The seasonal dipole between North and South America is
   found to modulate Pacific El Nino-Southern Oscillation and tropical
   Atlantic influence on Caribbean rainfall. Copyright (c) 2011 Royal

AB Variations in the strength of the North Atlantic Ocean thermohaline
   circulation have been linked to rapid climate changes(1) during the last
   glacial cycle through oscillations in North Atlantic Deep Water
   formation and northward oceanic heat flux(2-4). The strength of the
   thermohaline circulation depends on the supply of warm, salty water to
   the North Atlantic, which, after losing heat to the atmosphere, produces
   the dense water masses that sink to great depths and circulate back
   south(2). Here we analyse two Caribbean Sea sediment cores, combining
   Mg/Ca palaeo-thermometry with measurements of oxygen isotopes in
   foraminiferal calcite in order to reconstruct tropical Atlantic surface
   salinity(5,6) during the last glacial cycle. We find that Caribbean
   salinity oscillated between saltier conditions during the cold oxygen
   isotope stages 2, 4 and 6, and lower salinities during the warm stages 3
   and 5, covarying with the strength of North Atlantic Deep Water
   formation(7). At the initiation of the Bolling/Allerod warm interval,
   Caribbean surface salinity decreased abruptly, suggesting that the
   advection of salty tropical waters into the North Atlantic amplified
   thermohaline circulation and contributed to high-latitude warming.

AB Slash-and-burn cultivation (swidden) is an important and extensive
   strategy among agriculturalists in Oceania. The length of the fallow
   period, in which non-cultivated vegetation is allowed to regrow, is
   critical to the sustainability of this strategy in tropical
   environments. Long fallow periods permit greater soil recovery and
   higher yields over the long term whereas shorter fallow periods drive
   cycles of soil degradation that ultimately result in a landscape that is
   too degraded for continued cultivation. Anthropologists recognize that
   decreasing swidden fallow times is a key form of agricultural
   intensification that may have shaped interpolity conflict and social
   complexity. Although it is easy to identify the degraded landscapes that
   are a legacy of this pattern today, it has been a challenge for
   archaeologists to identify the timing and rate at which such processes
   took place in the past. We use alluvial stratigraphic records of
   charcoal and stable carbon isotopes from a small drainage in Western
   Viti Levu, Fiji, to reconstruct the timing and rate of intensification
   of swidden agriculture from long-fallow clearing of native forest, to
   shorter fallow burning of secondary forest and grassland, to grassland
   conversion. Results suggest that swidden cultivation in the lower
   Sigatoka Valley did not commence until centuries after Lapita
   colonization (ca. 2950 cal BP). Early swiddening apparently used
   relatively short fallow periods coupled with residential mobility to
   sustain horticultural yields until mobility no longer became a viable
   option. Archaeological indicators of resource stress co-occur with
   persistent swiddening after 1450 cal BP, although these precede the
   collapse into degraded grassland conditions at 1000 cal BP.
   Archaeological evidence for conflict increase after landscape
   degradation, although emerging social inequalities only appear after
   centuries of degraded conditions and conflict.

AB We used up to 30 morphological characters to discriminate and describe
   species of the genus Discoporella based on complete colony specimens
   collected from both coasts of the Isthmus of Panama. The characters
   included zooidal characters and colony-level characters such as colony
   size and basal granule density. Species were classified by a series of
   multivariate cluster and linear discriminant analyses until the majority
   of specimens were assigned to their putative species with high
   confidence. In the first phase of the analyses, the colonies were
   grouped by ocean (Caribbean versus eastern Pacific), discriminated
   predominantly by colony size and basal granule density, characters that
   might reflect ecophenotypic responses to different conditions in primary
   productivity and predation between the two oceans. Further analyses of
   these two groups separately resulted in the discrimination of seven
   species. Five new species from the Caribbean (D. scutella, D. peltifera,
   D. bocasdeltoroensis, D. terminata and D. triangula), and two from the
   eastern Pacific (D. marcusorum and D. cookae). Of these, D. cookae had
   been identified previously as D. umbellata, a species once considered
   cosmopolitan, with a range spanning the Caribbean and eastern Pacific
   coasts of America. With the exception of one genetically defined clade
   represented by only two specimens, the correspondence of classification
   between groups discriminated morphometrically by separate step-wise
   multivariate analyses and those detected by a previous genetic analysis,
   ranged from 91% to 100%. In analyses of all specimens combined or
   separated by ocean, but using the total number of characters, 20% to 30%
   of the specimens could not be distinguished morphometrically from
   extremely similar sympatric species or cognate ("geminate") species from
   the opposite ocean. Diversity was higher in the Caribbean compared to
   the eastern Pacific, which reflects a similar pattern recently described
   for the genus Cupuladria from the same region.

AB Background: Climate change is a critical concern globally and small
   island developing states in the Pacific region are especially vulnerable
   to climate change-related phenomena. Pacific Islands have been
   identified as being amongst the countries most vulnerable to the health
   impacts of climate change. The purpose of this paper is to describe
   impacts of climate change on food and nutrition security in Pacific
   Island countries, the mechanisms linking climate change and nutrition,
   and strategies and policies to address them. Method: A literature review
   and documentary analysis was undertaken. Case materials from Pacific
   Island countries are used to illustrate both climate change impacts and
   promising strategies. Results: Climate change exacerbates the existing
   burden of malnutrition. Food and nutrition security are affected through
   changes in local food production and transition from traditional
   nutritious diets to dependence on less nutritious imported foods,
   undermining efforts to reduce hunger and promote nutrition.
   Undernutrition, in turn, weakens climate resilience and the coping
   strategies of vulnerable populations. Nutrition-sensitive adaptation and
   mitigation measures, climate-resilient and nutrition-sensitive
   agriculture development, improved maternal and child care and health,
   and both community development and food system resilience measures are
   proposed as means to address the impacts of climate change on food and
   nutrition security. Conclusion: Pacific Island countries should not face
   these challenges alone. Strengthened global, regional and community
   responses to organize better preparedness, adaptation and mitigation
   against climate change and its impact on nutrition in Pacific island
   countries is needed. Specific opportunities to address these issues in
   the Pacific will be presented.

   site visits to 90 renewable energy facilities, and focus groups with
   almost 800 community members in 10 countries, this study develops a
   series of overarching qualitative factors that correlate with programs
   that met their targets, sometimes ahead of schedule, and produced
   measurable benefits exceeding costs. The inverse of these factors is
   associated with programs that did not meet their targets, were behind
   schedule, and/or produced measurable costs exceeding benefits. It
   concludes by offering 10 lessons for energy analysts and development
   practitioners concerning appropriate technology, income generation,
   financing, political leadership, capacity building, programmatic
   flexibility, marketing and awareness, stakeholder engagement, community
   ownership, and technical standardization. (c) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All

AB Begomoviruses are phytopathogens that threaten food security [18]. Sida
   spp. are ubiquitous weed species found in Jamaica. Sida samples were
   collected island-wide, DNA was extracted via a modified Dellaporta
   method, and the viral genome was amplified using degenerate and
   sequence-specific primers [2, 11]. The amplicons were cloned and
   sequenced. Sequence analysis revealed that a DNA-A molecule isolated
   from a plant in Liguanea, St. Andrew, was 90.9% similar to Sida golden
   yellow vein virus-[United States of America:Homestead:A11], making it a
   strain of SiGYVV. It was named Sida golden yellow vein
   virus-[Jamaica:Liguanea 2:2008] (SiGYVV-[JM:Lig2:08]). The cognate
   DNA-B, previously unreported, was successfully cloned and was most
   similar to that of Malvastrum yellow mosaic Jamaica virus (MaYMJV).
   Phylogenetic analysis suggested that this virus was most closely related
   to begomoviruses that infect malvaceous hosts in Jamaica, Cuba and
   Florida in the United States.

AB Low calcium and high aluminium concentrations in the soils, waters and
   native foods have been hypothesised as environmental factors
   contributing to the unusually high incidence of amyotrophic lateral
   sclerosis and parkinsonism with dementia (ALS-PD) found on the island of
   Guam. The amounts of elemental aluminium and calcium were measured in
   foods of the native diet of the Chamorro people of Guam. The amount of
   aluminium eluted from topsoil by water at pH 7 at 22 °C was also
   measured. For comparison, food, water and soil samples were collected
   from two islands which have not reported a high incidence of ALS-PD
   syndromes: Palau and Jamaica.Compared with agricultural soils of Jamaica
   or Palau, the agricultural soils of Guam averaged 42-fold higher yield
   of elutable aluminium. The food data, however, do not indicate a
   differentially high exposure to elemental aluminium or low calcium
   intake in the diet of any one population. While this study did not
   detect an unusually high dietary aluminium or low dietary calcium
   content, the soils and possibly the dusts of Guam may be a major source
   of aluminium entering the body of the native people, particularly
   through the respiratory epithelium. Since iipid soluble organic ligands
   of aluminium more readily penetrate epithelial membranes, further study
   of soil aluminium ligands is required.

AB Knowledge of genetic connectivity is useful for understanding of the
   recovery potential of coral populations after various disturbances, such
   as coral mass bleaching. Population genetic studies in corals are mostly
   restricted to Australian and Caribbean species; studies in the northern
   Pacific are relatively limited. Using microsatellite markers, the
   population genetics of Acropora sp. 1 was examined between two regions
   in Japan, the Okinawa-Aka and Bonin Islands, which are separated by
   approximately 1,500 km of open water in a high-latitude area.
   Statistically significant but small genetic differentiation in Acropora
   sp. 1 was detected between and within these regions. Genetic diversity
   was not obviously reduced in populations of the Bonin Islands, which are
   relatively isolated. Thus, some level of connectivity appears to be
   maintained between the two regions, likely because of the high dispersal
   ability of this broadcast spawner.

   Shionomisaki is located at the northern margin of the distribution range
   of this species. Females of S. gracilis with gonadosomatic index (GSI)
   >= 4.0 were defined as mature based on the relationship between GSI and
   the histological maturity phases of their ovaries. More than 50% of
   females greater than 60 mm standard length (SL) were mature. Hatch dates
   of larvae and juveniles collected in the study area were determined by
   otolith daily ring counts and found to extend from April to November.
   The size at maturity of females (60 mm SL) and the spawning season of S.
   gracilis in the temperate waters off Cape Shionomisaki (April-November)
   was larger and shorter, respectively, than those in tropical waters in
   the western Pacific. The reproductive traits observed for S. gracilis
   off Cape Shionomisaki appear to be adaptive to northern temperate waters
   with seasonal changes in environmental conditions.

AB Impairment and breakdown in the symbiotic relationship between the coral
   host and its zooxanthellae has been documented in the major Caribbean
   reef building coral, Montastraea spp., when it is infected with yellow
   band/blotch disease (YBD) pathogens and/or exposed to unusually high
   seawater temperatures. Progressive degradation of zooxanthellar cellular
   integrity occurs, leading to the deterioration of coral tissue.
   Cytoplasmic organelles were displaced and chloroplasts are reduced and
   marginalized which is accompanied by internal swelling, vacuolization,
   fragmentation, and loss of cell wall structural integrity. Changes in
   algae that occur in YBD-infected corals differ from changes seen in
   corals undergoing solely temperature-induced, coral bleaching, however.
   In many disease-infected corals, there is no evidence of zooxanthella in
   the mucus, unlike in thermal bleaching, where zooxanthellae was evident
   in the coral surface layer. Isolated zooxanthellae inoculated with YBD
   pathogens showed a 96% decrease in chlorophyll a pigments compared to
   controls, and a 90% decrease in mitotic cell division over 96 hours of
   YBD bacterial inoculation (<p=0.0016). Cytoplasmic and organelle
   integrity is compromised after YB infection, while host tissue remains
   intact. The YBD bacterial pathogens seem to target the symbiotic
   zooxanthellae indicating an algal infection. Isolated zooxanthellae
   samples subjected to higher temperatures and bacterial pathogens reveal
   virus-like particles (VLP) that are observed within algal cytoplasm, but
   their significance remains unknown and requires further investigation.
   The results of this study suggest that YBD and other coral disease is
   primarily a disease of the symbiotic zooxanthellae rather than of the
   coral host. These data elucidate the different cellular mechanisms
   between thermal bleaching and coral diseases in the Caribbean and
   Pacific.

   current oil-water contacts (OWCs) and in currently water-bearing "dry"
   wells; (2) palaeo oil accumulation within current gas zone; (3) palaeo
   oil columns below current OWCs, and (4) palaeo oil in currently
   water-bearing "dry" wells. The QGF and QGF-E methods, which provide
   information on both current and palaeo oil saturation, have been shown
   to be very effective in unravelling hydrocarbon charge history in the

AB The decline of sea turtle populations in the Caribbean has led to
   intensive recovery efforts. In Belizean waters, hawksbill turtles are
   seemingly making a comeback. At Glover's Reef Atoll particularly,
   juvenile hawksbill turtles are found in the fore-reef habitat. The
   population status and dynamics of this foraging aggregation were
   assessed to inform conservation management and to ascertain the national
   and regional importance of this site. During 12 sampling periods from
   2007 to 2013, turtles of all species were counted, captured, and tagged.
   For hawksbill turtles, the capture-recapture histories were combined
   with the counts using a mark-resight analysis under a robust design.
   This provided estimates of abundance as well as survival and transition
   rates. From 2009 onward, distance sampling was also used to estimate
   density and abundance of hawksbill turtles and the less frequently
   encountered green and loggerhead turtles. Distance sampling provided a
   more cost-effective estimation method for multiple species and another
   more precise source of abundance estimates for hawksbills. This is the
   first study known to use either mark-resight or distance sampling
   methods during snorkel surveys of sea turtles. It produced reasonably
   congruent abundance estimates of >1000 juvenile hawksbills and an order
   of magnitude less of green and loggerhead turtles. The mark-resight
   analysis estimated an apparent juvenile hawksbill survival probability
   of 0.975 (95% CI: 0.936-0.99), indicating that mortality factors are
   low. The Atoll provides important developmental habitat for juvenile
   hawksbills, contributing to the recovery of the species on the national
   and regional scale.

AB Bonefish are typically thought of as flats fish' that reside in shallow,
   tropical and subtropical nearshore coastal waters. However, evidence
   from tagging and acoustic tracking studies indicate that bonefish
   migrate to staging areas, form large aggregations (>5000 individuals),
   and then move to deep-water drop-offs at dusk to spawn. Because the
   offshore spawning occurs under the cover of darkness, visual
   observations of the actual bonefish spawning events are not possible.
   Fortunately, behaviors during pre-spawning aggregations provide clues
   related to putative spawning bouts. For multiple locations in The
   Bahamas, we report on repeatable, predictable behaviors of bonefish in
   large prespawning aggregations. Just prior to moving from shallow to
   deeper waters, bonefish are observed breaking the water surface
   (porpoising') and then returning to the aggregation. Bubbles are then
   observed emerging from the swirling aggregation; potentially gas being
   released from the bonefish. Ventral nudging, when one fish rubs its
   snout on the ventral region of another, has also been observed, but not
   as consistently as porpoising. Based on the depth profile of
   acoustically tagged fish, we hypothesize that porpoising is related to
   pneumatic assist' for egg release during spawning bouts. Although these
   observations provide circumstantial evidence that these behaviors are
   related to spawning, they are consistent with the prespawning behaviors
   of other marine fish that broadcast spawn. More research is needed to
   actually document a spawning bout; however, these clues in addition to
   other traits may be enough to encourage conservation measures to protect
   this important life history event for bonefish.

AB The Papua New Guinea University of Natural Resources and Environment is
   engaged in a study on selected traditional green leafy vegetables, with
   traditional defined as pre-colonial. These locally grown vegetables
   compete in the market place and in diets with a range of introduced
   species. Recorded information is scarce on the sources, genetic
   variation and nutritional values of the species prominent in local
   lowland markets or subsistence systems and is needed for assessment of
   their future roles in income generation, nutrition and the need for
   preservation as genetic resources. Market surveys revealed the three
   most common species to be aibika (Abelmoschus manihot), karakap (Solanum
   nigrum) and aupa (Amaranthus tricolor). Aibika is well known and studied
   in the Pacific and, hence, project work has been concentrated so far on
   aupa. The work has identified three cultivars based on stem colour. They
   compete well in the market with most sellers being female and themselves
   producers. Limited chemical analyses suggest that aupa is overall the
   most nutritious of the species studied. Subsequent work has considered
   seed germination, since aupa is not vegetatively propagated. Growth
   studies have shown varietal differences in branch formation but not in
   other growth parameters. The most recent work has compared the growth
   and yield of varieties planted out in the field as seedlings in
   comparison with the abundant and commercially grown Brassica chinensis.
   Differences in plant form between aupa varieties gave differences in
   final plant weight but the Brassica produced a greater weight of edible
   leaves and stem.

AB The unusual tsunami generated by the July 17, 1998 Papua New Guinea
   earthquake was investigated on the basis of various geophysical
   observations, including seismological data, tsunami waveform records,
   and on-land and submarine surveys. The tsunami source models were
   constructed for seismological high-angle and low-angle faults, splay
   fault, and submarine slumps. Far-field and near-field tsunamis computed
   from these models were compared with the recorded waveforms in and
   around Japan and the measured heights along the coast around Sissano
   Lagoon, respectively. In order to reproduce the far-field tsunami
   waveforms, small sources such as splay fault or submarine slump alone
   were not enough, and a seismological fault model was required. Relocated
   aftershock distribution and observed coastal subsidence were preferable
   for the low-angle fault, but the low-angle fault alone could not
   reproduce the large near-field tsunamis. The low-angle fault with
   additional source, possibly a submarine slump, is the most likely source
   of the 1998 tsunami, although other possibilities cannot be excluded.
   Computations from different source models showed that the far-field
   tsunami amplitudes are proportional to the displaced water volume at the
   source, and the comparison with the observed tsunami amplitudes
   indicated that the displaced water volume at the 1998 tsunami source was
   similar to0.6 km(3). The near-filed tsunami heights, on the other hand,
   are determined by the potential energy of displaced water, and the
   comparison with the observed heights showed that the potential energy
   was similar to2x10(12) J.

AB Abstract
   In the South Pacific Convergence Zone (SPCZ), the variability in a
   sub-seasonally resolved microatoll Porites colony Sr/Ca record from
   Tonga and a previously published high-resolution record from Fiji are
   strongly influenced by sea surface temperature (SST) over the
   calibration period from 1981 to 2004 (R-2 = 0.67-0.68). However, the
   Sr/Ca-derived SST correlation to instrumental SST decreases back in
   time. The lower frequency secular trend (~1 degrees C) and decadal-scale
   (~2-3 degrees C) modes in Sr/Ca-derived SST are almost two times larger
   than that observed in instrumental SST. The coral Sr/Ca records suggest
   that local effects on SST generate larger amplitude variability than
   gridded SST products indicate. Reconstructed delta O-18 of seawater
   (delta O-18(sw)) at these sites correlate with instrumental sea surface
   salinity (SSS; r = 0.64-0.67) but not local precipitation (r = -0.10 to
   -0.22) demonstrating that the advection and mixing of different salinity
   water masses may be the predominant control on delta O-18(sw) in this
   region. The Sr/Ca records indicate SST warming over the last 100 years
   and appears to be related to the expansion of the western Pacific warm
   pool (WPWP) including an increasing rate of expansion in the last ~20
   years. The reconstructed delta O-18(sw) over the last 100 years also
   shows surface water freshening across the SPCZ. The warming and
   freshening of the surface ocean in our study area suggests that the SPCZ
   has been shifting (expanding) southeast, possibly related to the
   southward shift and intensification of the South Pacific gyre over the
   last 50 years in response to strengthened westerly winds.

   Haiti, an island nation with limited resources, including food,
   resilience is more difficult without a framework to guide recovery. A
   model that proposes the use of partnership development and gardening
   interventions to achieve sustainable food relief is described. The
   approach involves assessment of needs, nutrition education and training,
   community and home gardens, partnerships, entrepreneurship, policy
   development, marketing, and the involvement of stakeholders in local and
   international communities. Application of the model may greatly enhance
   sustainable food supply for the most vulnerable populations in Haiti.

AB Background and Objectives: To assess the nutritional status of infants,
   children and non-pregnant women and underlying factors, dietary
   diversity and community food security, in the Kamea community in Gulf
   Province, Papua New Guinea. Methods and Study Design: Prospective cross
   sectional study. Study population 69 infants (0-59 months), 151 children
   (6-12 years) and 79 non-pregnant women from 10 villages in Kotidanga
   Local Level Government, Kerema District, Gulf Province, Papua New
   Guinea. Results: Among infants prevalence of moderate stunting, wasting
   and underweight were 38.9%, 8.3% and 44.4%, respectively; after
   adjusting Hb concentration for altitude, the anaemia prevalence was
   53.8%. Among children prevalence of severe stunting was 21.2%; moderate
   stunting, wasting and underweight were 57.6%, 12.2% and 48.5%,
   respectively; anaemia was 30.3%; median urinary iodine concentration was
   32.0 p.g/L and iodine deficiency was prevalent among 88.1%. Among women,
   mean height, weight and BMI were 1.46 0.04 m, 43.9 5.91 kg and 20.4 2.32
   kg/m(2), respectively; low BMI (<18.5 kg/m(2)) and anaemia were
   prevalent among 22.8% and 35.4%, respectively; median urinary iodine
   concentration was 36.0 ng/L and iodine deficiency was prevalent among
   80.3%. Exclusive breastfeeding was universal for young infants;
   complementary foods were limited in variety and frequency. Dietary
   diversity was limited, implementation of the universal salt iodisation
   strategy restricted and community food security was inadequate.
   Conclusions: The high prevalence of malnutrition and anaemia among the
   three age groups, including moderate status of iodine deficiency among
   women and children, are significant public health concerns. Improvements
   in dietary diversity, adequate use of iodised salt and community food
   security are needed.

AB Fishing with a variety of methods and gears, including traps, is allowed
   within the waters of Virgin islands National Park (St. John, U.S. Virgin
   Islands). Randall's 1961 observation of the effects of overfishing in
   nearshore waters off St. John has been followed by three and a half
   decades of reports documenting the declining reef fish catch in the
   Virgin Islands and much of the Caribbean. To assess the state of the
   trap fishery in St. John waters, traps set by fishers were visually
   censused in situ in 1992, 1993 and 1994 both inside and outside park
   waters. Fifty-nine species of fishes representing 23 families and 1340
   individuals were identified from 285 traps set in five habitat types
   (coral reef, octocoral hard-bottom, seagrass beds, algal plains and
   non-living substrate). The greatest number of observed traps were in
   algal plain (31%) and gorgonian habitat (27%), pointing to greater
   exploitation of deeper, non-coral habitats. Coral habitat accounted for
   the most species trapped (41), whereas the mean number of fishes per
   trap was highest in algal plain (5.7, se=0.6). Six species made up 51%
   of all fish observed in traps. The Acanthuridae was the most abundant
   family. Species composition and number of fishes per trap were similar
   inside and outside park waters. Scarids and serranids were more
   frequently observed in traps inside the park. Between 1992 and 1994,
   patterns in the data emerged: smaller numbers of fish per trap; shifts
   to smaller size classes; fewer serranids, lutjanids, sparids, and
   balistids, and all feeding guilds except herbivores per trap; more
   acanthurids per trap. Compared with other trap data from the Virgin
   Islands and the Caribbean - Florida region, the mean number of fish and
   biomass per St. John trap are low, serranid numbers are low, and
   acanthurid and herbivore numbers are high. The reef-associated fishes of
   St. John appear to be overexploited.

AB The coralgal framework within the outer reef margin of many Indo-Pacific

   significance of which can be inferred by comparison with their modern
   counterparts. A community dominated by tabular Acropora gr.
   hyacinthus/cytherea with branching Pocillopora damicornis, P. eydouxi,
   Montipora digitata: occasional domal faviids and mm-thick crusts of the
   coralline algae Lithophyllum and Mesophyllum (mainly), typical of the 6
   - 15 m paleodepth range; a community including robust-branching Acropora
   gr. danai/robusta, A. humilis, A. digitifera and subordinate Favia
   stelligera, Echinopora gemmacea, associated to vermetid gastropods and
   thick coralline crusts of Hydrolithon cf. onkodes and Neogoniolithon cf.
   fosliei flourishing in depths less than 6 m; in medium-to-high
   water-energy settings, a community composed of domal Porites cf. lutea
   and P. cf. lobata with occasional Acropora gr. danai/robusta and
   cm-thick crusts of coralline algae in sheltered habitats in depths less
   than 10 m.
   These biological assemblages allow us to determine relationships between
   reef growth and paleobathymetry and, consequently, to reconstruct
   regional relative sea-level curves. High water-energy reefal assemblages
   provide stronger evidence for reconstructing sea-level curves than
   low-energy buildups, because they have generally been controlled by a
   keep-up growth mode. Subsiding reef sites seem to be more reliable
   indicators of sea-level Variations because they usually present expanded
   reef sequences. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Factors related to adoption of new agricultural technologies have been
   given increasing attention, especially in developing countries where
   such technologies offer opportunities to increase food production. One
   of the most immediate ways to improve food production significantly is
   through the adoption of high yielding varieties of food crops, but rates
   of adoption are often low, especially among the rural poor. In
   Timor-Leste, improved varieties of food crops with yield advantages
   across all agro-ecological zones have been introduced. However, despite
   yield advantages, suitability and high levels of food insecurity,
   discontinuance occurs and adoption rates are low. To identify factors
   related to adoption of the improved varieties across agro-ecological
   zones, binary logistic regression was performed on data collected from
   1511 rural households. The results identified several factors related to
   adoption and showed that their impact varied across agro-ecological
   zones. The factor most strongly related to adoption was having a
   relationship to a grower of an improved variety of food crop and the
   closeness of this relationship. Furthermore, the following factors were
   related to adoption with variation across agro-ecological zones: age;
   education; size of farming plots; travel time between household and
   farming plot; involvement with the programme developing the improved
   varieties of food crops and participation in groups and training
   programmes. Overall, the findings of this study emphasize that
   dissemination strategies should embrace social relationships and be
   sensitive to agro-ecological zones.

AB A growing body of knowledge on the diversity and evolution of intertidal
   isopods across different regions worldwide has enhanced our
   understanding on biological diversification at the poorly studied, yet
   vast, sea-land interface. High genetic divergences among numerous
   allopatric lineages have been identified within presumed single broadly
   distributed species. Excirolana mayana is an intertidal isopod that is
   commonly found in sandy beaches throughout the Gulf of California. Its
   distribution in the Pacific extends from this basin to Colombia and in
   the Atlantic from Florida to Venezuela. Despite its broad distribution
   and ecological importance, its evolutionary history has been largely
   neglected. Herein, we examined phylogeographic patterns of E. mayana in
   the Gulf of California and the Caribbean, based on maximum-likelihood
   and Bayesian phylogenetic analyses of DNA sequences from four
   mitochondrial genes (16S rDNA, 12S rDNA, cytochrome oxidase I gene, and
   cytochrome b gene). We compared the phylogeographic patterns of E.
   mayana with those of the coastal isopods Ligia and Excirolana
   braziliensis (Gulf of California and Caribbean) and Tylos (Gulf of
   California). We found highly divergent lineages in both, the Gulf of
   California and Caribbean, suggesting the presence of multiple species.
   We identified two instances of Atlantic-Pacific divergences. Some
   geographical structuring among the major clades found in the Caribbean
   is observed. Haplotypes from the Gulf of California form a monophyletic
   group sister to a lineage found in Venezuela. Phylogeographic patterns
   of E. mayana in the Gulf of California differ from those observed in
   Ligia and Tylos in this region. Nonetheless, several clades of E. mayana
   have similar distributions to clades of these two other isopod taxa. The
   high levels of cryptic diversity detected in E. mayana also pose
   challenges for the conservation of this isopod and its fragile
   environment, the sandy shores.
