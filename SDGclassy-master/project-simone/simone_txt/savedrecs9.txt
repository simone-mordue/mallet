AB The venerid genus Anomalocardia is tropical American in origin, yet has
   a distribution spanning the tropical western Atlantic to western Pacific
   oceans. This distribution makes it the most widespread genus of the
   monophyletic, tropical American Chioninae. Other tropical American
   chionine genera have either remained restricted to American waters since
   their originations at various times during the early Neogene, or have
   sparse fossil or relict Recent distributions in the northwestern
   Pacific. This is in spite of tremendous diversification throughout
   Atlantic and Pacific American waters. Here we analyze the morphologic
   variation of A. squamosa (Linneaus, 1758) from Thailand, focusing
   specifically on the correspondence between morphological variability and
   microhabitat variation, with the eventual goal of uncovering possible
   adaptive advantages of Anomalocardia relative to other chionine genera.
   Significant variation was found among sites, characterized by
   differences in the shape of valve commissures and siphonal regions. The
   variation corresponds qualitatively with differences in sediment and
   water energy. We further compare A. squamosa to the congeneric, western
   Atlantic A. brasiliana (Gmelin, 1791), and the related eastern Pacific
   species, Iliochione subrugosa (Wood, 1828), establishing A. squamosa as
   a geographically widespread species, and finding all the taxa to be
   morphologically distinct. Finally, the analysis of A. brasiliana reveals
   that individuals from the Caribbean are morphologically distinct from
   Brazilian individuals.

AB Changing precipitation patterns including more intense and prolonged dry
   periods have become a growing concern for people living in the Pacific
   Island region. People in the region are particularly sensitive to these
   changes given their resource-based livelihoods and high dependence on
   rainfall for their freshwater needs. Despite this, little attention has
   been given to understanding the implications of climatic changes for
   people and their capacity to manage these changes. This paper assesses
   human vulnerability to climate change (as it relates to fresh water
   resources) in Vusama, an iTaukei village in southwest Viti Levu, Fiji in
   the context of recent social and ecological changes. An analysis of data
   collected using a vulnerability approach that included semi-structured
   interviews, participant observation and analysis of secondary sources
   reveal that climate change together with behavioural changes are
   negatively affecting availability and access to clean freshwater, with
   implications for household economies, food security and human health. In
   particular, prolonged drought and changing seasonal patterns, together
   with people's increasing reliance on a village borehole in lieu of
   family wells have resulted in a freshwater crisis. People are coping by
   using earnings from wage employment and harvesting and selling seafood
   to buy water and vegetables, rationing freshwater and depending on
   extended social networks for fresh produce. Current responses are
   reactive and short-term. Longer-term adaptation strategies are needed
   that consider expected future climate change and broader human
   development goals.

AB We evaluate the ability of global climate models participating in phase
   5 of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5) to reproduce
   observed seasonality and interannual variability of temperature over the
   Caribbean, and compare these with simulations from atmosphere-only
   (AMIP5) and previous-generation CMIP3 models. Compared to station and
   gridded observations, nearly every CMIP5, CMIP3 and AMIP5 simulation
   tends to reproduce the primary inter-regional features of the Caribbean
   annual temperature cycle. In most coupled model simulations, however,
   boreal summer temperature lags observations by about 1 month, with a
   similar lag in the simulated annual cycle of sea surface temperature
   (SST), and a systematic cold bias in both climatological annual mean air
   temperature and SST. There is some improvement from CMIP3 to CMIP5 but
   the bias is still marked compared to AMIP5 and observations, implying
   that biases in the annual temperature cycle may originate in the ocean
   component of the coupled models. This also suggests a tendency for
   models to over-emphasize the influence of SSTs on near-surface
   temperature, a bias that may be exacerbated by model tendency to
   over-estimate ocean mixed layer depth as well. In contrast, we find that
   both coupled and atmosphere-only models tend to reasonably simulate the
   response of observed temperature to global temperature, to regional and
   large-scale variability across the Caribbean region and the Gulf of
   Mexico, and even to more remote Atlantic and Pacific influences. These
   findings contribute to building confidence in the ability of coupled
   models to simulate the effect of global-scale change on the Caribbean.

AB Brontispa longissima (Coleoptera: Chrysomelidae) is a serious pest of
   coconut palm, and the species contains two cryptic species: the "Asian
   clade'' is distributed over a wide area, including Asia and the Pacific
   region, whereas the "Pacific clade'' is distributed in a limited area.
   Recent invasions and outbreaks have only been reported for the Asian
   clade, suggesting that invasive ability may differ between the clades.
   To reveal differences in invasiveness, we investigated the damage
   potential on coconut palm and range expansion of the two clades in
   Timor-Leste, where both clades are present. Distribution of the clades
   and of severely damaged trees indicated that range expansion and
   outbreaks have occurred for the Asian clade but not for the Pacific
   clade. The Asian clade attacked trees taller than 10 m, whereas the
   Pacific clade seldom attacked these trees. The preference for the taller
   trees, which are more abundant, can facilitate range expansion and
   outbreaks of the Asian clade. The beetle has spread through areas where
   coconut palms are continuously available, but have not expanded their
   distribution where coconut palms are separated by large gaps. This
   indicates that areas free of coconut palm could serve as buffer zones to
   prevent spread of this beetle.

   System (OBIS), Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF),
   Encyclopedia of Life (EOL), iSpecies, FishBase and the National

   cross-referenced with digital taxonomic systems such as the Catalog of
   Fishes of the California Academy of Sciences, the World Register of
   Marine Species (WoRMS), and the Integrated Taxonomic Information System
   (ITIS). There is a total of two subclasses two divisions, 13 orders, 44
   families, 84 genera, and 217 species that represent approximately 18% of
   all living and described species of chondrichthyans worldwide. For the
   Mexican Pacific and the Gulf of California, 92 species of
   chondrichthyans are listed compared to 94 species for the Gulf of Mexico
   and the Caribbean Sea. Additionally, 31 species listed occur on both
   coasts of Mexico. The species richness of the Mexican chondrichthyans
   will surely continue to increase, due to the exploration of deep-water
   fishing areas in the EEZ.

AB Objectives: People in the Papua New Guinea Highlands consume sweet
   potatoes as their dietary staple; consumption of animal protein is
   limited. In such societies with marginal protein intake, the
   intra-household allocation of animal protein in terms of sex or age is
   of importance. The objective of this study was to investigate how the
   allocation pattern of protein-rich foods by sex and age is associated
   with economic development in the Papua New Guinea Highlands.
   Methods: The carbon and nitrogen isotopic compositions of fingernails,
   collected in 1995 in two areas (Tari and Port Moresby [the national
   capital where Tari migrants resided]), and of scalp hair, collected in
   2007, 2012, and 2013 in three areas of different degree of economic
   development (Levani, Tari, and Goroka) were analyzed.
   Results: Analysis of fingernail samples showed that delta N-15 was lower
   in rural communities than in the urban migrant community, while a sex
   difference in delta N-15 (higher in males than in females) was found in
   the former but not in the latter community. Age was not associated with
   either delta N-15 or delta C-13 values. The analysis of scalp hair
   samples showed that delta N-15 values were lowest in Levani, the least
   developed area. Furthermore, there were statistically significant sex
   differences in delta N-15 values in Levani but not in Tari and Goroka.
   Age was not associated with either delta N-15 or delta C-13 values.
   Discussion: The sex inequality in animal protein consumption seems to
   have decreased as the communities in the Papua New Guinea Highlands have
   experienced economic development. (C) 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB A 10-member ensemble from phase 5 of the Coupled Model Intercomparison
   Project (CMIP5) is used to analyze the Caribbean's future climate when
   mean global surface air temperatures are 1.5 degrees, 2.0 degrees, and
   2.5 degrees C above preindustrial (1861-1900) values. The global warming
   targets are attained by the 2030s, 2050s, and 2070s respectively for
   RCP4.5. The Caribbean on average exhibits smaller mean surface air
   temperature increases than the globe, although there are parts of the
   region that are always warmer than the global warming targets. In
   comparison to the present (using a 1971-2000 baseline), the Caribbean
   domain is 0.5 degrees to 1.5 degrees C warmer at the 1.58 degrees C
   target, 5%-10% wetter except for the northeast and southeast Caribbean,
   which are drier, and experiences increases in annual warm spells of more
   than 100 days. At the 2.0 degrees C target, there is additional warming
   by 0.28-1.0 degrees C, a further extension of warm spells by up to 70
   days, a shift to a predominantly drier region (5%-15% less than present
   day), and a greater occurrence of droughts. The climate patterns at 2.5
   degrees C indicate an intensification of the changes seen at 2.0 degrees
   C. The shift in the rainfall pattern between 1.5 degrees C (wet) and 2.0
   degrees C (dry) for parts of the domain has implications for regional
   adaptation pursuits. The results provide some justification for the
   lobby by the Caribbean Community and Small Island Developing States to
   limit global warming to 1.5 degrees C above preindustrial levels, as
   embodied in the slogan "1.5 to Stay Alive.''

AB U.S. drug control policies impose supply reduction targets on source and
   transit nations without regard for their social, economic, or political
   environments. Simultaneously, immigration policies deport drug felons to
   these countries. This article advances the argument that these policies
   have displaced responsibility for U.S. crime problems. As a result,
   there is displacement of criminal activities to areas of least
   resistance, with drug transit nations being disproportionately affected.
   The article addresses, in part, the paucity of drug policy literature on
   the Caribbean drug transit region. It discusses the nexus between U.S.
   drug and immigration policies and the resulting consequences for
   Jamaica, a drug transit country. Jamaica is of special interest because
   of its long-standing presence on the U.S. drug policy agenda and its
   stereotyping in journalistic discussions.

AB The high price volatility of crude oil and its derivatives has resulted
   in unmanageable power generation costs in many regions worldwide. This
   paper proposes a unique alternative fuel blend, namely methanol and
   biofuels that have hitherto escaped the purview of policy-makers.
   Availability of fuel supply, lower environmental impact, job creation
   and reduction in fuel subsidy are some of the socio-economic benefits. A
   framework was developed for examining the economic feasibility of this
   alternative considering the entire energy value chain. The case study
   used is the power generation markets of the Caribbean. A probabilistic
   approach using Monte Carlo simulations was adopted to account for
   uncertainty in key input parameters. The results indicated that the
   methanol/vegetable oil chain is a feasible alternative for the
   Caribbean. The methanol/vegetable oil chain was also found to be more
   economically competitive than most other energy supply chain options.

AB New Guinea's mammalian fauna consists of a unique assemblage of
   relatively small sized (0.5-13.5 kg) marsupial mammals, the hunting of
   which provides a major source of protein for local communities. However,
   the impact of hunting and the influence of the marsupial life-history
   strategies on the sustainability of hunting are unknown. Anthropological
   studies of subsistence hunting and published life-history data for
   Australasian marsupial mammals were quantitatively reviewed to determine
   the major sources of game and annual harvest, and estimate intrinsic
   rates of population increase (r(max)) and population densities. These
   data were used to estimate extraction versus maximum sustainable
   production (MSP) and make a preliminary estimate of the sustainability
   of hunting. There were significant negative relationships between
   increasing body size and decreasing rmax and decreasing population
   densities, which were further influenced by phylogeny and diet, and
   appear very similar to relationships found for placental mammals in
   Afrotropical and Neotropical forests. The estimated biomass of mid-sized
   marsupial mammals (923 kg/km(2)) in Papua New Guinea is also comparable
   with densities of placental mammals in other evergreen tropical forests.
   Intrinsic rates of increase ranged from 0.28 for tree-kangaroos
   (Macropodidae) and 0.29 for cuscus (Phalangeridae), up to 5.14 for
   bandicoots/echymipera (Peroryctidae). Estimated population densities
   ranged from 0.4-4.0 animals/km(2) for long-beaked echidna (Zaglossus
   sp.) to 150-340 animals/km(2) for ringtails (Pseudocheridae). Extraction
   rates of game in three studies averaged 23.5 +/- 9.9 kg/km(2)/year, with
   cuscus and bandicoot species numerically comprising the main game,
   although cuscus are the most important source of protein. Rates of
   extraction in Papua New Guinea versus rates of production demonstrate
   that long-beaked echidna. tree-kangaroos and cuscus are likely to be
   hunted unsustainably. In contrast hunting of bandicoots and ringtails
   was lower than maximum production levels, and the high intrinsic rate of
   increase of bandicoots means that they can potentially provide a
   sustainable source of protein, in preference to scarcer and
   intrinsically slower breeding species. (C) 2010 Published by Elsevier

AB Understanding processes that may stabilize ecological systems confronted
   with rapidly changing environmental conditions is a key issue in
   ecology. We studied a system of highly fluctuating populations, the moth
   Achyra rantalis feeding on the plant Sesuvium portulacastrum in a group
   of small subtropical islands of the Bahamas. The plant is a prostrate
   inhabitant of shorelines, and consequently moths are highly vulnerable
   to being consumed by the ground-foraging lizard Anolis sagrei. We
   measured the percent ground cover of Sesuvium and abundance of Achyra on
   11 islands with lizards present and 21 islands without lizards annually
   for 10 consecutive years. Overall abundance of Achyra was 4.6 times
   higher on no-lizard islands than on lizard islands. The percent cover of
   Sesuvium exhibited lower temporal variability on lizard islands when the
   study site was undisturbed by hurricanes, and higher recovery rate on
   lizard islands following hurricanes. We suggest that both of these
   stabilizing phenomena are linked to a trophic cascade in which predatory
   lizards control herbivore populations, thereby suppressing outbreaks and
   enhancing plant recovery following physical disturbance.

AB Following criticism of the use of 'indicator' taxa for conservation
   planning in continental areas and large islands, the appropriateness of
   the potential biodiversity indicators on small islands was investigated.
   Studies of species richness and diversity in forest sites on two of the
   Seychelles islands identify a correlation between increasing diversity
   and altitude for many invertebrate groups. Deviations from this pattern
   were caused by anthropogenic habitat modification and the presence of
   alien species. A less marked pattern was present in most vertebrates,
   except that the most frequently used vertebrate indicator group, birds,
   showed a decreasing diversity with altitude. The use of biodiversity
   indicators on small islands with a relatively restricted fauna is
   suggested to be of less value than accurate whole fauna surveys which
   can take into account the distribution of alien and threatened taxa.

AB Background: Colonial invertebrates such as corals exhibit nested levels
   of modularity, imposing a challenge to the depiction of their
   morphological evolution. Comparisons among diverse Caribbean gorgonian
   corals suggest decoupling of evolution at the polyp vs. branch/internode
   levels. Thus, evolutionary change in polyp form or size (the colonial
   module sensu stricto) does not imply a change in colony form
   (constructed of modular branches and other emergent features). This
   study examined the patterns of morphological integration at the
   intraspecific level. Pseudopterogorgia bipinnata (Verrill)
   (Octocorallia: Gorgoniidae) is a Caribbean shallow water gorgonian that
   can colonize most reef habitats (shallow/exposed vs. deep/protected; 1 -
   45 m) and shows great morphological variation.
   Results: To characterize the genotype/environment relationship and
   phenotypic plasticity in P. bipinnata, two microsatellite loci,
   mitochondrial (MSHI) and nuclear ( ITS) DNA sequences, and ( ITS2) DGGE
   banding patterns were initially compared among the populations present
   in the coral reefs of Belize (Carrie Bow Cay), Panama (Bocas del Toro),
   Colombia (Cartagena) and the Bahamas (San Salvador). Despite the large
   and discrete differentiation of morphotypes, there was no concordant
   genetic variation (DGGE banding patterns) in the ITS2 genotypes from
   Belize, Panama and Colombia. ITS1 - 5.8S- ITS2 phylogenetic analysis
   afforded evidence for considering the species P. kallos ( Bielschowsky)
   as the shallow-most morphotype of P. bipinnata from exposed
   environments. The population from Carrie Bow Cay, Belize (1 - 45 m) was
   examined to determine the phenotypic integration of modular features
   such as branch thickness, polyp aperture, interpolyp distance, internode
   length and branch length. Third-order partial correlation coefficients
   suggested significant integration between polypar and colonial traits.
   Some features did not change at all despite 10-fold differences in other
   integrated features. More importantly, some colonial features showed
   dependence on modular features.
   Conclusion: Consequently, module integration in gorgonian corals can be
   shifted, switched or canalized along lineages. Modular marine organisms
   such as corals are variations on a single theme: their modules can
   couple or decouple, allowing them to adapt to all marine benthic
   environments.

AB The spread of marine invasive species at large geographic scales depends
   largely on current-driven larval dispersal. However, at smaller spatial
   scales, movements occurring after larval settlement can greatly
   influence the success of local control programs. We conducted the first
   dedicated tracking study of Indo-Pacific lionfish (Pterois volitans and
   P. miles) on Caribbean coral reefs. Using a mark-resighting approach, we
   estimated the scale and frequency of movements of 79 tagged lionfish on
   patchy and continuous reefs to study factors influencing movement. Many
   tagged lionfish moved relatively little, with similar to 60 % of fish
   resighted at least once and 10 % not moving from their initial tagging
   location. However, maximum movements (as far as 1.35 km in 15 days) far
   exceeded previous estimates. Lionfish movement was density dependent,
   declined at larger body sizes, and depended on seascape structure.
   Lionfish on continuous reefs moved faster and more often than those on
   patch reefs, and lionfish in patchy habitats moved farther when patches
   were closer together. Invasions taking place over heterogeneous
   seascapes such as coral reefs are difficult to manage effectively with
   spatially uniform regional management plans, but understanding an
   invader's movement ecology can help to optimize the distribution of
   limited resources for invasive management.

AB Alongside the trans-Atlantic slave trade, plant species travelled from
   Africa to the Americas and back. This article examines the emerging rice
   gene pool in Suriname due to the global circulation of people, plants
   and goods. We distinguish three phases of circulation, marked by two
   major transitions. Rice was brought to the Americas by European
   colonizers, mostly as food on board of slave ships. In Suriname rice
   started off as a crop grown only by Maroon communities in the forests of
   the Suriname interior. For these runaway slaves cultivating several
   types of rice for diverse purposes played an important role in restoring
   some of their African culture. Rice was an anti-commodity that acted as
   a signal of protest against the slave-based plantation economy. After
   the end of slavery, contract labourers recruited from British India and
   the Dutch Indies also brought rice to Suriname. These groups grew rice
   as a commodity for internal and global markets. This formed the basis of
   a second transition, turning rice into an object of scientific research.
   The last phase of science-driven circulation of rice connected the
   late-colonial period with the global Green Revolution.

AB The responses of the atmospheric water cycle and climate of West Africa
   and the Atlantic to radiative forcing of Saharan dust are studied using
   the NASA finite volume general circulation model (fvGCM), coupled to a
   mixed layer ocean. We find evidence of an "elevated heat pump" (EHP)
   mechanism that underlines the responses of the atmospheric water cycle
   to dust forcing as follow. During the boreal summer, as a result of
   large-scale atmospheric feedback triggered by absorbing dust aerosols,
   rainfall and cloudiness are enhanced over the West Africa/Eastern
   Atlantic ITCZ, and suppressed over the West Atlantic and Caribbean
   region. Shortwave radiation absorption by dust warms the atmosphere and
   cools the surface, while longwave has the opposite response. The
   elevated dust layer warms the air over West Africa and the eastern
   Atlantic. As the warm air rises, it spawns a large-scale onshore flow
   carrying the moist air from the eastern Atlantic and the Gulf of Guinea.
   The onshore flow in turn enhances the deep convection over West Africa
   land, and the eastern Atlantic. The condensation heating associated with
   the ensuing deep convection drives and maintains an anomalous
   large-scale east-west overturning circulation with rising motion over
   West Africa/eastern Atlantic, and sinking motion over the Caribbean
   region. The response also includes a strengthening of the West African
   monsoon, manifested in a northward shift of the West Africa
   precipitation over land, increased low-level westerly flow over West
   Africa at the southern edge of the dust layer, and a near surface
   westerly jet underneath the dust layer over the Sahara. The dust
   radiative forcing also leads to significant changes in surface energy
   fluxes, resulting in cooling of the West African land and the eastern
   Atlantic, and warming in the West Atlantic and Caribbean. The EHP effect
   is most effective for moderate to highly absorbing dusts, and becomes
   minimized for reflecting dust with single scattering albedo at 0.95 or
   higher.

AB A new species of chimaera, Chimaera bahamaensis sp. nov., is described
   from a single specimen collected in Bahamian waters, east of Andros
   Island, in the western North Atlantic. The new species is only the
   fourth member of this genus known to occur in the Atlantic Ocean. It is
   distinguished from other Atlantic Ocean Chimaera species by a
   combination of morphometric characters and coloration including a
   relatively large body, long pre-narial length, short pectoral-pelvic
   space, long pelvic-caudal space, caudal ventral margin ending slightly
   posterior to caudal dorsal margin, and a uniform caramel brown
   coloration with dark brown fins. This new species is compared to
   Chimaera monstrosa Linnaeus, 1758, Chimaera cubana Howell-Rivero, 1936,
   and Chimaera cf. monstrosa, the only other species in the genus Chimaera
   known to occur in the Atlantic Ocean.

AB Light traps were used to describe the vertical distribution of late
   larval stages of reef fishes in the San Blas Archipelago during three
   successive new moon periods. Traps were deployed in the lagoon and at an
   exposed site on the outer reef edge. At each site, two traps were
   anchored at the surface and two traps just above the bottom. Most
   families of reef fishes that were abundant in catches displayed clear
   patterns of depth preference. The larvae of gerrids, pomacentrids and
   lutjanids were predominantly captured in shallow traps. while gobiids,
   labrids, apogonids and blenniids were usually collected in deep traps.
   Studies that used lights to aggregate and collect larval fishes display
   marked differences in the composition of catches between the Great
   Barrier Reef (GBR) and the Caribbean. In order to determine whether such
   results were due to biases inherent in different sampling methods, or to
   locality-specific patterns of larval behaviour, we simultaneously
   deployed light traps and dip-netting around lights during three new
   moons in the San Blas Archipelago. We found that these sampling
   techniques collected differing components of the larval fish assemblage
   from the same water mass. However, there remains good evidence for the
   existence of locality-specific responses to light in older larval
   stages, suggesting that broad generalisations about patterns and causes
   of vertical distributions may be difficult to achieve.

AB Understanding population dynamics is essential for implementing
   effective conservation and management of coastal sharks.
   Fisheries-independent surveys can offer valuable information for such
   data-limited situations. A 12-year (2004-2015) standardized, shallow
   water longline survey was conducted monthly in the coastal waters of
   Bimini, Bahamas. Each monthly survey comprised five longline sets,
   totaling 75 hooks, with a soak time of 24 h. A total of 770 sharks from
   nine species were caught over the course of the study, with tiger
   (Galeocerdo envier), nurse (Ginglymostoma eirratum), blacktip
   (Carcharhinus limbatus) and lemon (Negaprion brevirostris) sharks
   comprising 95% of the catch. The majority of tiger (87%), nurse (62%),
   blacktip (67%), and lemon (82%) sharks were of immature lengths. A
   greater number of captured tiger (77%) and blacktip (66%) sharks were
   female, while nurse (55%) and lemon sharks (73%) were predominantly
   male. Poisson generalized additive models were used to analyze local
   abundance trends and examine how catch rates were influenced by year,
   month, location, tide, hour of capture, and lunar cycle. Seasonal trends
   indicate greater catches of the nurse, blacktip and lemon sharks during
   the summer months. Annual trends indicated relatively stable catch rates
   for the tiger, blacktip and lemon shark. Nurse shark catch rates were
   highly variable during the survey. Results from this study improve our
   understanding of the coastal shark assemblage in Bimini, Bahamas, and
   provide important local abundance trend information that could be
   beneficial for conservation and regional assessments.

AB An extensive sediment transport survey took place at Lihir Island (Papua
   New Guinea), where mining operations involve disposal of waste rocks and
   soil in nearshore waters. To investigate the potential impact of these
   practices over neighbouring fringing reefs, turbidity and sediment
   accumulation were measured continuously for extended periods. Turbidity
   records provided a map of observed impact zones based on turbidity
   thresholds. The main zoning features were (a) that an extreme turbidity
   gradient persists between the inner harbour (turbidity levels of
   100-1000 mgl(-1)) and the adjacent reefs (turbidity levels in the order
   of 10 mgl(-1)), and (b) that observed zones conform with pre-operations
   impact predictions. Accumulation measurements unveiled no significant
   sediment accumulation over fringing coral reefs. This study contributes
   to the understanding of the potential impact of sediment discharge to
   nearshore waters. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Deep scattering layers (DSLs) play an important role in pelagic food
   webs, serving as a vehicle for transferring energy between productive
   surface waters and the deep sea. We ex plored the spatial dynamics of
   DSLs off the Bahamas in shaping oligotrophic ecosystems. We compared 2
   areas known to be important foraging habitats for a deep-diving
   predator, Blainville's beaked whales: the Tongue of the Ocean (TOTO), an
   oceanographically isolated habitat, and the waters off Abaco Island, an
   oceanographically connected habitat. Using ship-based multifrequency
   echosounders and direct net sampling, we identified common layer
   structures characterized by diffuse, broad layers (> 100 m in thickness)
   observed across the study areas. Within those diffuse layers, we
   occasionally observed distinctively bounded intense layers (similar to
   20 m in thickness) located at the upper edges of the DSLs. We found that
   spatial variability of layer structures shaped the Bahamian ecosystem.
   By comparing common layer types across the sampling locations, 2
   potential mechanisms were identified. The area off Abaco Island was
   characterized by diffuse layers comprised of larger animals with greater
   migration distance and biomass than the habitat in TOTO, suggesting that
   Abaco may transfer more energy between energy-rich surface waters and
   the deep sea. Within TOTO, habitat most frequently used by beaked whales
   was characterized by the highest occurrence of intense layers dominated
   by thinner layers, suggesting such fine-scale structures may increase
   foraging efficiency by layer predators. Spatial variability of the DSL
   structures reveals the dynamics of the Bahamian mesopelagic ecosystem,
   potentially driving the beaked whales through bottom-up control of their
   prey.

AB The leaf palatability of 10 temperature and 10 tropical tree-species was
   compared in two woodland sites, in Switzerland and Papua New Guinea. 
   Relative palatability was estimated by scoring damage visually during
   feeding trials with numerous species of chewing insects, drawn from the
   local pool of species.  The average palatability temperature foliage to
   its local community of chewing insects was significantly higher, by a
   factor of 2.3, than that of tropical foliage.  In multiple regression
   analyses considering different plant-related variables, 71% of the
   variance in leaf palatability could be accounted for by the number of
   young leaves or leaflets recorded during the field-study and by the
   average leaf area.  Based upon food acceptance in laboratory conditions,
   the proportion of insect morphospecies which behaved as generalists was
   higher at the temperature site (44%) than at the tropical site (18%). 
   These results reflect intrinsic differences between deciduous trees
   growing at the temperature site and evergreen trees growing at the
   tropical site.

AB A coral (Orbicella faveolata) delta C-13 isotope ratio record off the
   southwest coast of Puerto Rico is used to indicate regional
   ocean-atmosphere conditions over the 20th century. The coral delta C-13
   record is correlated positively with North Atlantic sea surface
   temperature (SST) and local evaporation. Spatial correlation maps show a
   broad area of influence by SST, sea-level pressure and evaporation to
   the northeast of Puerto Rico. The composite maps reflect a strengthening
   of the North Atlantic anticyclone and east Pacific counter-currents
   during years of enhanced coral growth. The coral delta C-13 record
   presented here corresponds with a local cloud cover increase of similar
   to 10% in parallel with a 0.5 degrees C rise of local SST since 1900.
   Environmental conditions tend to lead coral growth in a knock-on effect
   as seen in local SST, cloud cover and evaporation data. The coral
   community may thus be a sentinel of both multi-year fluctuations and
   centennial trends in Central Caribbean climate.

   environmental, social, and political issues that such a scheme would
   involve. Scientific papers that are referenced in support of the
   arguments in the paper in many cases do not deal with the issues on
   which they are quoted. The authors appear to have little understanding
   of the geography of the areas they are discussing, which leads them to
   make many erroneous assertions about these places. The paper contains a
   considerable amount of irrelevant and trivial material, such as the life

AB To develop improved estimates of (1) flooding due to storm surges, and
   (2) wetland losses due to accelerated sea-level rise, the work of
   Hoozemans et al. (1993) is extended to a dynamic analysis. It considers
   the effects of several simultaneously changing factors, including: (1)
   global sea-level rise and subsidence; (2) increasing coastal population;
   and (3) improving standards of flood defence (using GNP/capita as an
   "ability-to-pay" parameter). The global sea-level rise scenarios are
   derived from two General Circulation Model (GCM) experiments of the
   Hadley Centre: (1) the HadCM2 greenhouse gas only ensemble experiment
   and (2) the more recent HadCM3 greenhouse gas only experiment. In all
   cases there is a global rise in sea level of about 38 cm from 1990 to
   the 2080s. No other climate change is considered. Relative to an
   evolving reference scenario without sea-level rise, this analysis
   suggests that the number of people hooded by storm surge in a typical
   year will be more than five times higher due to sea-level rise by the
   2080s. Many of these people will experience annual or more frequent
   flooding, suggesting that the increase in flood frequency will be more
   than nuisance level and some response (increased protection, migration,
   etc.) will be required. In absolute terms, the areas most vulnerable to
   flooding are the southern Mediterranean, Africa, and most particularly,
   South and South-east Asia where there is a concentration of low-lying
   populated deltas. However, the Caribbean, the Indian Ocean islands and
   the Pacific Ocean small islands may experience the largest relative
   increase in flood risk. By the 2080s, sea-level rise could cause the
   loss of up to 22% of the world's coastal wetlands. When combined with
   other losses due to direct human action, up to 70% of the world's
   coastal wetlands could be lost by the 2080s, although then is
   considerable uncertainty. Therefore, sea-level rise would reinforce
   other adverse trends of wetland loss. The largest losses due to
   sea-level rise will be around the Mediterranean and Baltic and to a
   lesser extent on the Atlantic coast of Central and North America and the
   smaller islands of the Caribbean. Collectively, these results show that
   a relatively small global rise in sea level could have significant
   adverse impacts if there is no adaptive response. Given the "commitment
   to sea-level rise" irrespective of any realistic future emissions
   policy, there is a need to start strategic planning of appropriate
   responses now. Given that coastal flooding and wetland loss are already
   important problems, such planning could have immediate benefits. (C)

AB Sago starch is an important source of dietary carbohydrates in lowland
   Papua New Guinea. Over the past 30 years there have been sporadic
   reports of severe illness following consumption of sago starch. A common
   assumption is that fungal metabolites might be associated with the
   illness, leading to the need for a more thorough investigation of the
   mycoflora of sago starch. Sago starch was collected from areas of high
   sago consumption in Papua New Guinea for fungal analysis (69 samples).
   Storage methods and duration were recorded at the time of collection and
   pH on arrival at the laboratory. Yeasts were isolated from all samples
   except two, ranging from 1.2 x 10(3) to 8.3 x 10(7) Cfu/g. Moulds were
   isolated from 65 of the 69 samples, ranging from 1.0 X 10(2) to 3.0 X
   10(6) Cfu/g. Of 44 samples tested for ergosterol content, 42 samples
   showed the presence of fungal biomass. Statistical analyses indicated
   that sago starch stored for greater than five weeks yielded
   significantly higher ergosterol content and higher numbers of moulds
   than sago stored for less than five weeks. The method of storage was
   also shown to influence mould numbers with storage in natural woven
   fibre containers returning significantly greater numbers than present in
   other storage methods tested. Potentially mycotoxigenic genera of moulds
   including Aspergillus and Penicillium were commonly isolated from sago
   starch, and as such storage factors that influence the growth of these
   and other filamentous fungi might contribute to the safety of
   traditional sago starch in PNG. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights

   South Africa, Seychelles, Comoros, Madagascar, Reunion and Mauritius.
   Only about 60 references have been published from this region since the
   1930's, covering mainly seagrass diversity and ecology, and only about
   30 of these have been published during the last 10 years in
   international journals. These covered mainly ecology, ecophysiology and
   anatomy/histochemistry. Considering this and the fact that eastern
   Africa with its 12 species is a region of high diversity of seagrasses,
   seagrass research in the region appears to be in its infancy. Apart from
   the need for continued survey and mapping activities, future research
   has to focus on the significance of seagrass beds in the region, their
   role in the coastal ecosystem and how they are affected by various
   anthropogenic changes.

AB Background: We evaluated the reliability and validity of the short form
   household food security scale in a different setting from the one in
   which it was developed.
   Methods: The scale was interview administered to 531 subjects from 286
   households in north central Trinidad in Trinidad and Tobago, West
   Indies. We evaluated the six items by fitting item response theory
   models to estimate item thresholds, estimating agreement among
   respondents in the same households and estimating the slope index of
   income-related inequality (SII) after adjusting for age, sex and
   ethnicity.
   Results: Item-score correlations ranged from 0.52 to 0.79 and Cronbach's
   alpha was 0.87. Item responses gave within-household correlation
   coefficients ranging from 0.70 to 0.78. Estimated item thresholds (
   standard errors) from the Rasch model ranged from -2.027 (0.063) for the
   'balanced meal' item to 2.251 (0.116) for the 'hungry' item. The
   'balanced meal' item had the lowest threshold in each ethnic group even
   though there was evidence of differential functioning for this item by
   ethnicity. Relative thresholds of other items were generally consistent
   with US data. Estimation of the SII, comparing those at the bottom with
   those at the top of the income scale, gave relative odds for an
   affirmative response of 3.77 (95% confidence interval 1.40 to 10.2) for
   the lowest severity item, and 20.8 (2.67 to 162.5) for highest severity
   item. Food insecurity was associated with reduced consumption of green
   vegetables after additionally adjusting for income and education (0.52,
   0.28 to 0.96).
   Conclusions: The household food security scale gives reliable and valid
   responses in this setting. Differing relative item thresholds compared
   with US data do not require alteration to the cut-points for
   classification of 'food insecurity without hunger' or 'food insecurity
   with hunger'. The data provide further evidence that re-evaluation of
   the 'balanced meal' item is required.

AB The transition between shallow and mesophotic coral reef communities in
   the tropics is characterized by a significant gradient in abiotic and
   biotic conditions that could result in potential trade-offs in energy
   allocation. The mesophotic reefs in the Bahamas and the Cayman Islands
   have a rich sponge fauna with significantly greater percent cover of
   sponges than in their respective shallow reef communities, but
   relatively low numbers of spongivores. Plakortis angulospiculatus, a
   common sponge species that spans the depth gradient from shallow to
   mesophotic reefs in the Caribbean, regenerates faster following
   predation and invests more energy in protein synthesis at mesophotic
   depths compared to shallow reef conspecifics. However, since P.
   angulospiculatus from mesophotic reefs typically contain lower
   concentrations of chemical feeding deterrents, they are not able to
   defend new tissue from predation as efficiently as conspecifics from
   shallow reefs. Nonetheless, following exposure to predators on shallow
   reefs, transplanted P. angulospiculatus from mesophotic depths developed
   chemical deterrence to predatory fishes. A survey of bioactive extracts
   indicated that a specific defensive metabolite, plakortide F, varied in
   concentration with depth, producing altered deterrence between shallow
   and mesophotic reef P. angulospiculatus. Different selective pressures
   in shallow and mesophotic habitats have resulted in phenotypic
   plasticity within this sponge species that is manifested in variable
   chemical defense and tissue regeneration at wound sites.

AB Studies of island endemism provide a unique opportunity to elucidate
   fundamental mechanisms of speciation. Here we examine intra- and
   interspecific DNA sequence variation at four unlinked genetic loci among
   populations of the Drosophila dunni subgroup to provide a detailed
   genealogical portrait of the process of speciation among these island
   endemic species. Our data indicate two major rounds of diversification
   that have shaped the D. dunni subgroup. The first occurred 1.6-2.6
   million years ago and separated three major lineages, one in Puerto Rico
   and the Virgin Islands, a second in the northern Lesser Antilles and
   Barbados, and a third in St. Vincent and Grenada. A second round of
   diversification occurred in the last 96,000 years in the northern Lesser
   Antilles and Barbados. The four distinct species that resulted from this
   recent round of diversification maintain relatively high amounts of
   genetic variation, similar to that of a closely related mainland
   species, and share extensive ancestral polymorphism. These data suggest
   a minimal role for population bottlenecks linked to founder events in
   the history of the D. dunni subgroup. Further, the recent divergence of
   these island populations highlights the extremely rapid development of
   reproductive isolation and distinct patterns of abdominal pigmentation
   that has occurred in these species.

AB The present study on the fish fauna of Bioko reports a total of 43
   species of 21 families; 18 of which are new records for the island. 
   Bioko's icthyofauna is made up of 17 freshwater and 26 saltwater and
   brackish water species.  Freshwater fishes are primarily restricted to a
   narrow belt along the north and west of the island, similar to the
   adjacent volcanic region around Mount Cameroon.  The rest of the island,
   however, is inhabited by salt tolerant fishes, as found in Sao Tome,
   Principe and Annobon.  Fish communities also vary according to elevation
   since rivers on Bioko are characterized by steep gradients from source
   to sea.  Pressures on Bioko's river systems are not alarmingly high but
   may increase in the future because of the use of toxic products (lime
   and insecticides) for fishing.  There is no doubt that this is having a
   significant effect on northern and western rivers which are precisely
   the most species-rich.  Aphyosemion oeseri, which is endemic to Bioko,
   and which has a distribution restricted to the small northern rivers is
   in great danger of extinction.  P. monkei is in a similarly precarious
   situation, given that it is extremely rare and will probably disappear
   altogether in a few years from the island's rivers.  Before the
   situation becomes irreversible urgent measures must be taken to improve
   matters through educational campaigns as well as through cleaning up
   heavily-polluted rivers and re-stocking them with fish species from
   neighbouring river basins.

AB Regional systematic conservation planning is an effective approach to
   marine protected area (MPA) network design, ensuring complementarity,
   and functional connectivity of areas. However, regional planning and
   local conservation actions do not properly inform one another. One
   outcome is the failure of regional designs to guide conservation
   actions. Another is that site-based MPAs constitute collections rather
   than functional systems for marine conservation. Understanding decisions
   related to spatial scale in conservation planning is essential for the
   development of ecologically functional networks of MPAs. Decisions about
   scale require that planners address trade-offs between the respective
   advantages and limitations of different considerations in several parts
   of the planning process. We provide the first comprehensive review of
   decisions about spatial scale that influence planning outcomes. We
   illustrate these decisions and the trade-offs involved with planning
   exercises undertaken in the Coral Triangle. We provide a framework in
   which decisions about spatial scale can be made explicit and
   investigated further. The framework helps to link theory and application
   in conservation planning, facilitates learning, and promotes the
   application of conservation actions that are both regionally and locally
   significant.

AB In the western equatorial Pacific the low-salinity core of Antarctic
   Intermediate Water (AAIW) is found at about 800 m depth between
   potential density levels sigma(0) = 27.2 and 27.3. The pathways of AAIW
   and the degradation of its core are studied, from the Bismarck Sea to
   the Caroline Basins and into the zonal equatorial current system. Both
   historical and new observational data, and results from numerical
   circulation model runs are used. The observations include hydrographic
   stations from German and Japanese research vessels, and Eulerian and
   Lagrangian current measurements. The model is the JAMSTEC
   high-resolution numerical model based on the Modular Ocean Model (MOM
   2). The general agreement between results from the observations and from
   the model enables us to diagnose properties and to provide new
   information on the AAIW. The analysis confirms the paramount influence
   of topography on the spreading of the AAIW tongue north of New Guinea.
   Two cores of AAIW are found in the eastern Bismarck Sea. One core
   originates from Vitiaz Strait and one from St. George's Channel,
   probably arriving on a cyclonic pathway. They merge in the western
   Bismarck Sea without much change in their total salt content, and the
   uniform core then increases considerably in salt content when subjected
   to mixing in the Caroline Basins. Hydrographic and moored current
   observations as well as model results show a distinct annual signal in
   salinity and velocity in the AAIW core off New Guinea. It appears to be
   related to the monsoonal change that is typically found in the
   near-surface waters in the region. Lagrangian data are used to
   investigate the structure of the deep New Guinea Coastal Undercurrent,
   the related cross-equatorial flow and eddy-structure, and the embedment
   in the zonal equatorial current system. Results from 17 neutrally
   buoyant RAFOS floats, ballasted to drift in the AAIW core layer, are
   compared with a numerical tracking experiment. In the model 73 particles
   are released at five-day intervals from Station J (2.5 degrees N, 142
   degrees E), simulating currents at a moored time series station north of
   New Guinea. Observed and model track patterns are fairly consistent in
   space and season. Floats cross the equator preferably north of
   Cenderawasih Bay, with a maximum range in eddy-motion in this region
   north of New Guinea. The northward route at 135 degrees E is also
   reflected in a low-salinity tongue reaching up to 3 degrees N. At that
   longitude the floats seem to ignore the zonally aligned equatorial
   undercurrents. Farther to the east (139-145 degrees E), however, the
   float observations are consistent with low-latitude bands of
   intermediate currents. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Small island developing states face unique constraints to the provision
   of electricity services in rural areas, given their geographical
   features, and the small scale of government bureaucracies and markets.
   In small island developing states situated in the Pacific Ocean, these
   factors have resulted in some of the lowest electrification rates in the
   world. Seventy percent of Pacific islanders are without access to power;
   a figure that is equivalent to access rates in Sub-Saharan Africa,
   despite higher income levels in the Pacific. Past efforts by government
   and aid organizations to expand electricity access in rural areas have
   achieved negligible success, given regulatory frameworks that do not
   encourage grid extension, and the absence of effective institutional
   frameworks for operation and maintenance of decentralized systems. This
   paper argues that the binding constraint to rural electrification in
   Pacific small island developing states is the failure of regulatory
   frameworks to establish a viable business model for investment.
   Regulatory reform is needed that creates commercial incentives for
   private and public sector power utilities to provide power in rural
   areas, both through extension of electricity networks and decentralized
   power provision. Regulatory reform could also address past problems with
   the operation and maintenance of decentralized systems.

AB Mouth gaping in sharks has been considered to be either a threat display
   or a response to sharksucker irritation, but has never been examined in
   greater detail. Another form of gaping was observed frequently around
   feeding scenarios, primarily when sharks swam away from the food source.
   This form of a yawn-like behavior of Caribbean reef sharks, Carcharhinus
   perezi, was videotaped during both standard feeding and non-feeding
   scenarios, and examined for both proximate causation and function. This
   type of gaping reflects a simulated bite process, including all bite
   phases, but differs from actual bites in that the duration is as great
   as 10 times longer, with the expansion phase disproportionally prolonged
   and a pause at the gape's peak. Of all the possible functions discussed,
   a maintenance behavior to reposition the jaw elements after feeding fits
   all of the measured parameters.

   families with reef-builders are considered endemic to the Atlantic,

   families spanning the two provinces belong to the same lineages ( that
   is, they are monophyletic). Here we show that this assumption is
   incorrect on the basis of analyses of mitochondrial and nuclear genes.
   Pervasive morphological convergence at the family level has obscured the
   evolutionary distinctiveness of Atlantic corals. Some Atlantic genera
   conventionally assigned to different families are more closely related
   to each other than they are to their respective Pacific 'congeners'.
   Nine of the 27 genera of reef-building Atlantic corals belong to this
   previously unrecognized lineage, which probably diverged over 34 million
   years ago. Although Pacific reefs have larger numbers of more narrowly
   distributed species, and therefore rank higher in biodiversity hotspot
   analyses(3), the deep evolutionary distinctiveness of many Atlantic

   tuna), Acanthocybium solandri (wahoo), Coryphaena hippurus
   (dolphinfish), and Scomberomorus cavalla (king mackerel), large pelagic
   fish species of commercial importance to several Caribbean countries.
   The Program explored several means to facilitate fish tag and release
   activities, involving collaborative partnerships with national fisheries
   administrations, the recreational fishing sector, and individual
   commercial fishers. A total of 1, 143 fish were tagged and released in
   the coastal waters of several islands within the Eastern Caribbean: 787
   blackfin tuna, 250 wahoo, 89 dolphinfish, and 17 king mackerel. To date,
   only 13 recaptures have been reported. Eleven (11) blackfin tuna,
   released in the coastal waters of St. Vincent and the Grenadines were
   recaptured near to, or at original release sites after times at liberty
   ranging from 5 d to 1,230 d. Similarly, 2 king mackerel, released off
   the west coast of Trinidad, were recaptured very near original release
   sites after 74 and 129 d at liberty

   Clara, Sagua, Nazabal, San Juan de los Remedios, Buenavista and Los
   Perros Bays, under different environmental conditions. There were
   analyzed also 22 samples from commercial trawl catches in the Nazabal
   and San Juan de los Remedios Bays, as well as 10 samples from commercial
   gill nets in Buenavista Bay. Additionally, 63 visual censuses and 10
   rotenone stations on mangroves located in the Bays were included.
   Totally, 149 fish species were surveyed on soft bottoms and associated
   mangroves. Los Perros Bay showed an extremely low species richness,
   which is a consequence of the hipersalinization (up to 83%o in 1995) of
   the Bay as result of the interference of the circulation regime by the
   crossways joining the bordering Cays between them and with the main
   island. The dominant species in those bays were very small non
   commercial fishes: the mojarras (Eucinostomus spp.) and the sheepshead
   minnow (Cyprinodon variegatus), The last was found in salinity up to
   75%o. Commercial lchthyofauna almost disappeared from Los Perros Bay and
   have been seriously affected in Buenavista Bay. The highest fish
   diversity was found in Sagua Bay, which receive the greater fresh water
   input, and at the same time the greater water exchange with the open
   sea. Nevertheless, the highest fishing biomass was found in San Juan de
   los Remedios Bay, It was observed a critical decrease of fish richness
   in salinity higher than 40%o and the total absence of the lchthyofauna
   over 75%o. In the rotenone samples, two new fish records were found for
   Cuba.

AB Hermit crabs (Anomura: Paguroidea) distribution patterns in the
   Colombian Caribbean Sea. Hermit crabs represent the marine life in the
   Colombian Caribbean, and are important for the dynamic equilibrium
   maintenance in ecosystems, the ecological interactions and their impact
   on food web stability. Generally, in order to come up with some
   conservation strategies, strong bio-geographical information is needed
   for policies definition. With this aim, this study analyzed the
   distribution patterns of hermit crabs in the Colombian Caribbean Sea.
   through classification and spatial ordination multivariate analyses,
   using historical records from years 1916 to 2006. Besides, the world
   distribution of Colombian species and their geographic affinity in the
   Caribbean and Western Atlantic were identified. The results show deep
   differences between coastal and continental slope faunas, and
   latitudinal differences in the assemblages, with the identification of
   three groups: Northeast, Center and Southwest. The differences in faunal
   composition that support these three groups were determined. Based on
   maps of the Colombian marine ecosystems, it was found that the main
   factors affecting the distribution of hermit crabs were the Caribana
   slope (depth), water-mass temperature, Guajira sea-grass beds, and
   particular conditions of "Coralline Archipelagos" and "Darien"
   eco-regions. Colombian hermit crab fauna is more related to the North
   Atlantic and the Antilles, than to the South Atlantic and the Gulf of
   Mexico. Additionally, geographical sub-provinces in which Colombia is
   included, these were found as transition Zones among Northern and
   Austral subprovinces of the Greater Caribbean. Rev. Biol. Trop. 60 (1):

   Parguera, Puerto Rico (Caribbean Sea) attached to mangrove prop roots in
   association with other encrusting algae. The new species has requisite
   generic characters in addition to developing dorsal protuberances formed
   by superimposition of uniporate (carpogonial) or multiporate
   conceptacles. It is suggested that by this unique mode of conceptacle
   production, enhanced fertilization and spore dispersal are achieved
   simultaneously as vegetative (perithallial) growth is reduced.

AB Understanding the dynamics of the Late Quaternary Caribbean mammal
   extinction event is complicated by continuing uncertainty over the
   taxonomic status of many species. Hispaniola is one of the few Caribbean
   islands to retain native non-volant mammals; however, there has been
   little consensus over past or present levels of diversity in Hispaniolan
   hutias (Capromyidae: Plagiodontinae). Craniodental measurement data from
   modern hutia specimens, previously classified as both Plagiodontia
   aedium and P. hylaeum, display morphological differences between
   Hispaniola's northern and southern palaeo-islands using MANOVA and PCA.
   Although attempts to amplify mitochondrial DNA from the holotype of P.
   aedium were unsuccessful, this specimen is morphometrically associated
   with southern palaeo-island specimens. The mandibular size distribution
   of recent Plagiodontia specimens is unimodal, but the Late Quaternary
   mandibular size distribution is multimodal and displays much broader
   measurement spread, representing multiple extinct species. Finite
   Mixture Analysis was used to assess the best fit of different taxonomic
   hypotheses to the fossil mandibular size distribution. All retained FMA
   models include living hutias and P. spelaeum as distinct taxa; PCA
   further demonstrates that levels of morphological variation between
   modern hutia populations are lower than levels between living hutias and
   P. spelaeum, so that living hutias are interpreted as the single species
   P. aedium. Taxonomic differentiation for larger-bodied hutias is less
   well defined, but most retained models show only one larger species, for
   which the only available name is P. velozi. Plagiodontia araeum is
   morphologically distinct from other species and is reassigned to
   Hyperplagiodontia. Hispaniola's plagiodontine fauna has lost its largest
   and smallest representatives; similar trends of body size selectivity in
   extinction risk are shown more widely across the Caribbean mammal fauna,
   possibly due to different regional anthropogenic threats (invasive
   mammals, hunting) affecting small-bodied and large-bodied mammals during
   the recent past. This apparent pattern of extinction selectivity is
   named the Goldilocks Hypothesis.

AB Hydrological regimes are key in shaping the structure of phytoplankton
   communities in estuaries. Because anthropogenic disturbances often alter
   the quantity and quality of riverine inputs, this research focused on
   investigating phytoplankton dynamics in the St. Lucia Estuary, since
   being reconnected to the Mfolozi River. Due to the closed mouth state of
   the estuary, the input from the river resulted in oligohaline (>= 5)
   conditions and the characteristic reverse salinity gradient to persist
   throughout the study (i.e. one year). Model results indicated that
   phytoplankton communities were structured by rainfall, light
   transmittance and depth, while shifts between dominant groups were
   driven by salinity and flow season. The persistence of chlorophytes and
   euglenophytes as the co-dominant functional group indicates the
   freshening and nutrient-enriched nature of the river. This study
   provides the first detailed account documenting the response of the
   phytoplankton community to recent restoration efforts in the St Lucia
   Estuary, a Ramsar Site.

AB SEDIMENT cores from low-latitude lakes provide some of the best records
   of tropical climate change since the late Pleistocene.  Here we report a
   high-resolution reconstruction of Caribbean climate based on O-18/O-16
   ratios in ostracod shells from Lake Miragoane, Haiti.  Our results show
   that the climate was dry and the lake level low during the latter part
   of the Younger Dryas chronozone (10.5-10 kyr BP), but that water level
   in the lake rose at the end of the last deglaciation (approximately 10-7
   kyr BP), reflecting the wetter conditions of the early Holocene which
   persisted for nearly 4,000 years.  Lake level declined at approximately
   3.2 kyr BP with the onset of a drier climate which generally prevailed
   throughout the late Holocene.  These long-term changes in Caribbean
   climate are generally similar to those found for Africa over the same
   period, and can be largely explained by orbitally induced (Milankovitch)
   variations in seasonal insolation which modified the intensity of the
   annual cycle.  Superimposed on the orbitally forced climate trends are
   more abrupt climate events that result from complex, nonlinear
   interactions in the ocean-atmosphere system.  The interpretation of
   Antillean biogeography and the development of Caribbean and Mesoamerican
   culture must be considered in the context of such shifts in climate.

AB Total dissolvable iron, manganese and aluminum distributions in upper

   Sea, and Tasman Sea. In these oceanic regions, the surface aluminum
   distributions well reflect the atmospheric deposition pattern of mineral
   dust in the western South Pacific reported previously. Surface manganese
   distributions derive mainly from lateral transportation from the coastal
   sediments of western tropical islands. Compared to Mn and Al, the Fe
   distributions reflect the nutrient cycle in upper waters. Iron
   limitation over the vast South Pacific, as revealed by physiological
   features of phytoplankton seems to, be caused by low atmospheric dust
   deposition and low Fe:N ratios in deep waters. In the western South
   Pacific, with its unique geographic and oceanographic settings, the
   local sources of trace metals might considerably affect their
   biogeochemical cycles.

   chaetigers 5-6 and sperm and spermatids in the following 4 chaetigers.
   No sperm storage organs were found. Oriopsis paramobilis is gonochoric,
   has three pairs of radioles, 8 thoracic chaetigers and up to 5 abdominal
   chaetigers. Females have a pair of spermathecae in the radiolar crown.
   Males have sperm with long nuclei, and an elongate midpiece. All species
   of Oriopsis described here have lateral ducts, from sperm-bearing
   segments, for sperm to exit to the water. Amphiglena nathae, described
   from two islands of Seychelles, Indian Ocean, has up to 6 pairs of

   species, like several other species of Amphiglena, is a simultaneous
   hermaphrodite with oocytes and developing sperm present in the first few
   abdominal chaetigers. Developing sperm are also present in several
   chaetigers posterior to oocyte-bearing segments. A pair of spermathecae
   were found at the base of the dorsal lips. This species broods larvae,
   each in an egg capsule, until they have 8 thoracic chaetigers when they

   pygidial lobe possessing a short cirrus and (ii) the posterior-most
   lateral organ extending dorsally. Protodrilus hochbergi sp. nov.

   differs in (i) the extension of the salivary glands to segment 15
   (versus 6) and (ii) the presence of paired lateral ciliary bands on the

AB The impact of increase in population on, land use and subsistence
   pattern was examined in two environmentally contrasting Huli-speaking
   communities, Hell and Wenani, in the Tari basin in Papua New Guinea
   Highlands. Despite the similar extent of population increase in both
   communities, the damage to land differed markedly. In Hell, a decrease
   in land productivity owing to excessive agricultural use has induced
   farmers to shorten the fallow duration, which in rum has led to further
   land degradation and difficulties in increasing food production. In
   contrast, Wenani villagers have coped with the population increase by
   enlarging areas for cultivation and possibly will be able to double
   their present production level, although increasingly frequent disputes
   over land rights have restricted peoples' access to fertile areas.
   During a period of climatic perturbations in 1994, land and labor
   productivities of crops were three rimes higher in Wenani than in Hell,
   which suffered a severe food shortage. This difference in ability to
   cope with climatic perturbations may have increased with population
   growth. The findings in the present study suggest that the effects of
   population pressure on food production may differ between communities,
   depending on the indigenous environment and subsistence pattern.

   the gross domestic product. This study investigates the impact of
   hurricane Ivan on Grenada's water supply. While it was found that a lack
   of water supply immediately following the hurricane resulted in hardship
   to citizens, the impact was reduced in areas where rainwater harvesting
   was established. The long term impacts of the hurricane on water supply
   may be reduced due to the rapid recovery of damaged vegetation in the
   water-producing watersheds, facilitated by a decline in agricultural
   activities in these watersheds. The absence of a national land use
   policy and lack of consideration for women in the management of water
   resources can impact negatively in the future on Grenada's ability to
   overcome a similar disaster. It is recommended that the National Water
   Authority includes the cost of insurance for its infrastructure in
   developing water tariffs and mainstreams disaster management and
   planning in its operations.

AB Benthic food chains of the Amazon (Brazil) and Fly (Papua New Guinea)
   river deltas and adjacent shelves are compared. Abundance patterns of
   the major trophic groups (bacteria, meiofauna, and macroinfauna) are
   similar between regions, with very low densities, or the absence of
   benthos, within and near the deltas. For muds in the more quiescent
   areas, benthic abundance and productivity are highest, commonly
   coinciding with maximum pelagic primary production. Episodes of physical
   disturbance, erratic food supply, and dilution of river-derived,
   particulate organic matter foster the development of opportunistic
   benthic communities of variable diversity and low biomass, dominated by
   bacteria. These pioneering assemblages are the main food of penaeid
   shrimp, which dominate the demersal trawl fisheries of both
   fluvial-dominated regions.

AB Cleaner fish on coral reefs can have a significant impact on the
   diversity and distribution of their fish clients. Understanding the
   factors affecting the distribution of cleaners themselves therefore
   becomes an important consideration for elucidating the mechanisms
   controlling coral reef fish community structure. We hypothesised that
   obligate cleaner fish, which rely almost exclusively on ectoparasites
   gleaned from clients, should be more abundant in areas rich in their
   preferred prey, namely parasitic gnathiid isopod larvae. We tested
   predictions from this hypothesis on 2 spatial scales in the Caribbean:
   among reefs within Barbados, and among 6 islands spanning the Greater
   and Lesser Antilles. As predicted, densities of coral-dwelling cleaning
   gobies Elacatinus spp., which are active cleaners, were higher in areas
   of high rates of emergence of gnathiid larvae from the benthos. This
   relationship was not observed in sponge-dwelling cleaning gobies, which
   rely mainly on non-client-gleaned food sources. The density of
   coral-dwelling cleaners was also correlated with client density, but
   contrary to our prediction was not related to ectoparasite loads of a
   common reef fish client. Cleaning goby abundance is more likely to be a
   consequence than a cause of ectoparasite availability, since cleaning
   goby recruitment is usually linked to factors related to foraging, and
   territorial clients do not preferentially settle near cleaning gobies.
   Whether the link between cleaner abundance and ectoparasite availability
   is mediated through differential recruitment or differential survival of
   cleaners in parasite-rich and parasite-poor areas remains to be
   determined.

AB Field experiments provide rigorous tests of ecological hypotheses but
   are usually limited to small spatial scales. It is thus unclear whether
   these findings extrapolate to larger scales relevant to conservation and
   management. We show that the results of experiments detecting
   density-dependent mortality of reef fish on small habitat patches scale
   up to have similar effects on much larger entire reefs that are the size
   of small marine reserves and approach the scale at which some reef
   fisheries operate. We suggest that accurate scaling is due to the type
   of species interaction causing local density dependence and the fact
   that localized events can be aggregated to describe larger-scale
   interactions with minimal distortion. Careful extrapolation from
   small-scale experiments identifying species interactions and their
   effects should improve our ability to predict the outcomes of
   alternative management strategies for coral reef fishes and their
   habitats.

AB AimThe theory of island biogeography provides a predictive framework
   relating species richness to island size and distance from the mainland.
   However, the theory as originally formulated does not necessarily scale
   to large islands and continental landmasses that are capable of
   generating species through insitu speciation (rather than entirely by
   colonization), nor does it necessarily account for how human
   introduction of species alters traditional biogeographical patterns.
   Here, we examine the ecological (colonization and extinction),
   evolutionary (insitu speciation) and human-mediated (deliberate
   introductions) determinants of species richness in a taxonomic group
   that has undergone a radiation on Caribbean islands: live-bearing fishes
   of the family Poeciliidae.
   LocationThe Caribbean.
   MethodsWe created a database of both native and introduced poeciliid
   species occurrence on Caribbean islands through literature review, and
   estimated the number of colonizations versus speciation events on each
   island using a molecular phylogeny. Linear regression and other
   statistical tests were used to explore species-area and
   species-isolation relationships.
   ResultsSpecies richness on small islands results entirely from
   colonization and does not significantly increase with island area,
   whereas on larger islands species richness increases dramatically as a
   function of area due primarily to insitu speciation. Poeciliid fishes
   have been introduced widely, both as a by-product of their popularity in
   the aquarium hobby and as a means of mosquito control. We show that such
   establishments have occurred disproportionately on islands depauperate
   in native species, and that introduced species richness is positively
   correlated with economic interconnectedness (shipping traffic) and human
   population size.
   Main conclusionsOn large Caribbean islands insitu speciation has
   elevated the number of poeciliid species beyond that predicted from
   ecological processes alone. Introduced species significantly alter
   biogeographical patterns.

AB The marine areas of South America (SA) include almost 30,000 km of
   coastline and encompass three different oceanic domains-the Caribbean,
   the Pacific, and the Atlantic-ranging in latitude from 12 degrees N to
   55 degrees S. The 10 countries that border these coasts have different
   research capabilities and taxonomic traditions that affect taxonomic
   knowledge. This paper analyzes the status of knowledge of marine
   biodiversity in five subregions along the Atlantic and Pacific coasts of
   South America (SA): the Tropical East Pacific, the Humboldt Current, the
   Patagonian Shelf, the Brazilian Shelves, and the Tropical West Atlantic,
   and it provides a review of ecosystem threats and regional marine
   conservation strategies. South American marine biodiversity is least
   well known in the tropical subregions (with the exception of Costa Rica
   and Panama). Differences in total biodiversity were observed between the
   Atlantic and Pacific oceans at the same latitude. In the north of the
   continent, the Tropical East Pacific is richer in species than the
   Tropical West Atlantic, however, when standardized by coastal length,
   there is very little difference among them. In the south, the Humboldt
   Current system is much richer than the Patagonian Shelf. An analysis of
   endemism shows that 75% of the species are reported within only one of
   the SA regions, while about 22% of the species of SA are not reported
   elsewhere in the world. National and regional initiatives focusing on
   new exploration, especially to unknown areas and ecosystems, as well as
   collaboration among countries are fundamental to achieving the goal of
   completing inventories of species diversity and distribution. These
   inventories will allow accurate interpretation of the biogeography of
   its two oceanic coasts and latitudinal trends, and will also provide
   relevant information for science based policies.

AB Quantitative and qualitative analyses of nannofossil assemblages from
   ODP Site 999 in the Caribbean Sea were performed to reveal changes in
   upper seawater structures and implications for climatic changes during
   the last 300,000 years. Overall, there is an inverse relationship in
   stratigraphic fluctuations between the absolute abundance (AA) of a
   lower photic taxon, Florisphaera profunda, and delta(18)O; this
   fluctuation pattern is considered to represent climatic changes in the
   Subtropical Under Water (SUW) in the Caribbean. Cross-spectral analysis
   demonstrates that the SUW was characterized by nutrient-rich water
   during interglacials; changes in orbitally driven gyre circulation
   system strongly affected fluctuations in the SUW in the Caribbean.
   Conversely, the surface water was enriched in nutrients during glacials
   as the result of increased terrigenous materials and shallowing of the
   thermocline based on changes of the N ratio (abundance of
   reticulofenestrids relative to F profunda) and results of cross-spectral
   analysis between them and delta(18)O. The relationship between the
   thermocline variation and the ice volume fluctuation suggests that
   changes in the subtropical gyre circulation system in the North Atlantic
   have had stronger influences on the Caribbean thermocline variations and
   there may be a little contribution of climatic fluctuations that
   originated in the Southern Ocean to the Caribbean Sea.
   A large floral turnover in nannofossil assemblages between oxygen
   isotope stages 6 and 5 was observed in Hole 999A, which corresponds to
   Termination II. On the basis of floral compositions, photosynthetic
   primary productions had been more active than today before Termination
   II. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Indirect and direct gradient ordination techniques were used to study
   the relationship between present-day benthic and periphytic diatom
   assemblages and environmental factors along an altitudinal gradient in
   Papua New Guinea. Both within the screened initial data-set and a
   narrowly-defined subset of soft-water lakes, shifts in diatom
   assemblages are clearly related to altitudinal differences. This
   relation is used to construct transfer functions for inferring altitude
   (and hence average water temperature) from the diatom records.
   Calibration by canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) and simple
   weighted averaging calibration proved to be superior to models using WA
   with tolerance downweighting and toa a simple WA model based on a
   selection of 52 indicator taxa. From the calibration models and the
   linear relationship between altitude and epilimnetic water temperature,
   the average lake water temperature can be predicted with an accuracy of
   3.2 degrees C. After further refinement, a transfer function for
   palaeotemperature based on diatoms would be of potential value for
   climatic reconstructions in tropical regions.

AB Economic geographers and political ecologists have developed valuable
   analyses of the ways in which the effects of economic globalisation and
   macro-economic 'one-size-fits-all' policies are unevenly distributed.
   Unpacking the global-local nexus, geographers have argued that such
   policies evoke heterogeneous responses and results. This article
   contributes to this body of work by discussing the effect of the
   European Union Sugar Reform for two specific Caribbean localities:
   Barbados and St Kitts. It first highlights how political decisions made
   in one locality have significant ramifications for places and peoples at
   a distance. Second, it suggests the importance of recognising our global
   interconnectivity and in considering how our responsibilities to/for
   distant strangers emerge through our historically-embedded production,
   trading and consumption habits. Third, this analysis shows the integral
   way in which geography matters; how one unilateral change in a common
   sugar trading policy can generate a multiplicity of different effects
   and responses in different places.

AB At least 170,000 rural people in the Pacific-island nation Vanuatu
   (approximately 70% of the country's population) live without reliable
   access to electricity. The few rural households that do consume
   electricity incur high prices for imported diesel fuel ($2-3/liter).
   Thus, there is an important role in Vanuatu for expanding
   cost-competitive, non-diesel alternatives for electricity generation.
   Informed by an interdisciplinary data synthesis and an extensive series
   of field interviews in Vanuatu, this paper analyzes the potential for
   converting reportedly obsolete timber plantation land into a dedicated
   feedstock supply system for new small-scale biomass gasifiers. The
   analysis draws upon geographic mapping of electricity demand and
   feedstock supply, a historical assessment of Vanuatu's forest
   plantations, a techno-economic evaluation of investment in 10 kW and 30
   kW gasifiers, and a discussion of important social-institutional
   factors.
   This analysis identifies up to 13 geographic matches between areas of
   rural electricity demand and potential feedstock supply. In addition,
   financial modeling suggests that the levelized cost of electricity from
   gasification is competitive (relative to diesel systems) given capacity
   factors of 15-40% or greater (corresponding to a cost of $1.60/kWh or
   less). Further research is recommended to examine the socioeconomic and
   ecological aspects of feedstock plantation establishment in Vanuatu. (C)

AB In this paper, a model is presented for the average growth of an
   individual giant clam. The model describes the clam's basic metabolic
   processes of photosynthesis, filter-feeding, respiration and "surplus"
   energy demand for unaccounted metabolic processes such as reproduction,
   and incorporates the effects of environmental variables including
   temperature, solar radiation, depth, visibility and nutrients in the
   seawater. A detailed mathematical description of the model is provided,
   and its operation is investigated by fitting it to growth data collected
   for Tridacna crocea and T derasa from smallholder-mariculture trials in
   Solomon Islands. Model calibration is described and the sensitivity of
   the simulation results to parameter values is considered. Growth
   predictions for both species are found to closely fit the observed data
   and to be very sensitive to small errors in the value of those
   parameters that regulate photosynthesis, respiration, surplus energy
   intake and how respiration responds to temperature. These results lend
   support for scientific research to better understand the relationships
   between these parameters and clam growth. The effect of environmental
   conditions on predicted growth is also investigated. Results indicate
   that growth has a substantial positive correlation with both visibility
   and nutrients. These environmental factors are likely to be negatively
   correlated with each other, hence nutrient-rich environments are likely
   to have low visibility and the benefits from nutrients may be outweighed
   by the costs of turbidity and clams may grow poorly. Although the
   mathematical model presented here could be applied to wild-stock clams,
   parameterisation with data from mariculture trials restricts its use to
   predicting growth over only a few years. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

AB Three years of temperature data along two transects extending to 90 in
   depth, at Palau, Micronesia, show twice-a-day thermocline vertical
   displacements of commonly 50-100 m, and on one occasion 270 m. The
   internal wave occurred at a number of frequencies. There were a number
   of spectral peaks at diurnal and semi-diurnal frequencies, as well as
   intermediate and sub-inertial frequencies, less so at the inertial
   frequency. At Palau the waves generally did not travel around the island
   because there was no coherence between internal waves on either side of
   the island. The internal waves at a site 30 km offshore were
   out-of-phase with those on the island slopes, suggesting that the waves
   were generated on the island slope and then radiated away. Palau Island
   was thus a source of internal wave energy for the surrounding ocean. A
   numerical model suggests that the tidal and low-frequency currents
   flowing around the island form internal waves with maximum wave
   amplitude on the island slope and that these waves radiate away from the
   island. The model also suggests that the headland at the southern tip of
   Palau prevents the internal waves to rotate around the island. The large
   temperature fluctuations (commonly daily fluctuations approximate to 10
   degreesC, peaking at 20 degreesC) appear responsible for generating a
   thermal stress responsible for a biologically depauperate biological
   community on the island slopes at depths between 60 and 120 m depth. (C)

AB Morphological characterisation of 2,298 accessions collected in
   Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand, Vietnam, the Philippines, Papua New
   Guinea and Vanuatu was conducted with 23 standardised descriptors and
   data bases were developed. More than 2,000 cultivars were
   electrophoresed on starch gels and six enzyme systems were revealed
   successfully (MDH, PGI, ICD, PGD, ME, SKDH). Each country selected a
   core sample for sharing composed of elite cultivars representing
   approximately 10% of the total number of accessions. Ploidy levels were
   determined using flow cytometry. AFLP fingerprinting was conducted on
   all cultivars included in the core sample. Meristems were excised and
   these genotypes were tissue cultured, indexed for DMV and distributed to
   participating countries. In Vanuatu, 378 cultivars were grown in a
   common plot, planted and harvested the same day, and their corms were
   boiled and submitted to a blind panel test composed of ten participants.
   Their eating quality was scored on a scale from 1 to 6 ( excellent). The
   physico-chemical characteristics of 31 cultivars, representing different
   morphotypes and including excellent and poor cultivars, were analysed to
   assess the extent of variation existing for traits related to corm
   quality ( dry matter content, minerals, lipids, proteins, gelatinisation
   temperature, amylose, glucose, fructose, saccharose, maltose and starch
   content). The results of these studies indicate that the genetic base of
   the cultivars is narrow. Only six zymotypes represent more than 51% of
   the total number of accessions electrophoresed and only 21 zymotypes
   represent more than the two thirds (70%) of the total number of
   accessions. AFLP analysis confirm the isozymes results and two distinct
   genepools are revealed, one in S. E. Asia and the other in the Pacific.
   It implies that crosses between accessions originating from only one
   country are not desirable and it is appropriate to cross cultivars from
   both genepools. Except for the temperature of gelatinisation, all
   physicochemical characteristics are variable. Good taste is correlated
   with high dry matter, starch and amylose contents.

AB The insular radiation of hutias is remarkable among mammals for its high
   rate of extinction during the Holocene (similar to 58% of species), yet
   fragments of intact habitat throughout the West Indies retain a critical
   portion of endemic diversity needing assessment. Cuba contains 8 of the
   11 recognized living species of hutias, with surviving forms also on
   Hispaniola, Jamaica, and the Bahamas. Herein, we performed molecular
   phylogenetic analyses across populations of Cuban hutias in the genera
   Capromys, Mesocapromys, and Mysateles to address major gaps in our
   understanding of their species limits, phylogenetic structure, and
   geographic distributions. Comparing sequences of mitochondrial genes
   (cyt-b, COI, 12S rRNA) from 41 individuals and 21 sites across the
   archipelago, we found evidence that Capromys pilorides contains a major
   species-level subdivision from western to eastern Cuba, spanning a
   greater geographic region than previously hypothesized. Populations of
   Capromys in each clade last shared a common ancestor similar to 1.1
   million years ago (Ma; 5.2% cyt-b divergence). The western clade is
   further subdivided between mainland hutias (C. p. pilorides) and those
   on Isla de la Juventud plus Cayo Cantiles (C. p. relictus has priority).
   The eastern clade contains all Capromys east of Sierra del Escambray in
   central Cuba, including mainland and insular forms. However, without
   paired analyses of morphology and genetics or data from type localities,
   we cannot assign a name to the eastern Capromys sp. nov. at this time.
   Divergence-time analyses across 9 named species of hutias (plus 1
   extinct), including nuclear genes (GHR, vWF, RAG1), dates the
   Capromyidae split from their South American relatives (Echimyidae) at
   15.5 Ma. The crown radiation of hutias was 8.8 Ma, with successive
   divergences at 5.4 Ma (Geocapromys), 3.1 Ma (Capromys), and 2.2 Ma
   (Mysateles-Mesocapromys). Detailed surveys are needed to assess the
   conservation status of these evolutionarily distinct Cuban taxa.

AB A regime sorting analysis is used to identify Caribbean and western
   Pacific precipitation, sea surface temperature, and large-scale vertical
   circulation relationships and biases within coupled and uncoupled
   Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Fourth Assessment Report (IPCC
   AR4) general circulation models. This analysis shows that an
   oversensitivity of precipitation to both SST and vertical circulation
   (as represented by omega(500)) is inherent in the atmospheric models in
   both regions, with models using a spectral-type convective
   parameterization performing best in the Caribbean, but less separation
   between convective parameterization groups is seen in the western
   Pacific. The error in magnitude of precipitation for a given SST and
   vertical circulation causes uncoupled models to overestimate Caribbean
   and western Pacific mean precipitation. In coupled models, however,
   errors in the frequency of occurrence of SSTs (the distribution is cold
   biased in both regions) and deep convective vertical circulations
   (reduced frequency) lead to an underestimation of Caribbean and western
   Pacific mean precipitation. In the western Pacific, increased frequency
   of subsidence regimes in coupled models leads to an overestimation of
   precipitation at cow) values above 0 hPa day(-1). The varied ability of
   convective parameterization groups in the two warm pool regions suggests
   that deficiencies in parameterization groups differ between the two
   regions, with improvements needed particularly in the deep convective
   regime in the Caribbean and subsidence regimes in the western Pacific.

   Methods and procedures Weighed recipes were collected in Afro-Caribbean
   households (mainly Jamaicans) in Manchester, UK.
   Main outcomes and results A total of 30 weighed recipes were collected
   for a variety of 18 Afro-Caribbean composite dishes. Among them, fried
   dumpling, Ackee and saltfish, fried chicken and rice and peas were high
   in energy, providing 201-356 kcal/100 g. Fried fish, Ackee and saltfish,
   stewed fish, and fried chicken had a high fat content (between 11.5% and
   25.9%).
   Conclusions We have provided for the first time some data on the energy,
   macro-nutrient and micronutrient content per 100 g for 18 Afro-Caribbean
   foods. These recipe data provide essential information for accurately
   assessing dietary intake and for determining associations between diet
   and chronic diseases among this population.

   Forty seven young skipjack tuna (Katsuwonus pelamis) were collected in
   the vicinity of southern Micronesia, but only 2 were found in the other

AB Before populations of green turtles (Chelonia mydas) were severely
   reduced by human overexploitation, the seagrass Thalassia testudinum was
   intensively grazed by green turtles in the Caribbean. To explore how
   nutrient composition of T. testudinum pastures responds to intense
   grazing pressure, we simulated green turtle grazing in 15 plots (each 3
   m x 3 m) for 16 months in the central Bahamas. Comparisons of clipped
   plots with 15 adjacent control (unclipped) plots revealed that simulated
   grazing resulted in significantly higher energy, nitrogen, phosphorus,
   lignin, cutin, and condensed tannin content in blades in clipped plots,
   but sediment organic content was not affected. By continually
   re-cropping blades in grazing plots, turtles ingest young, actively
   growing blade tissue with higher energy, nitrogen, and phosphorus
   concentrations. Our 16-month clipping trial did not generate the
   expected decline in nutrient content in T. testudinum blades under
   intensive grazing. However, significant decreases in nitrogen and
   organic matter reserves in rhizomes, with declines apparent after 16 and
   11 months, respectively, indicate that nutrient content of blades and/or
   blade productivity may decline under continued clipping.

AB The cephalopods of the wider Caribbean region (western central Atlantic)
   were examined in terms of distribution and ecological importance. In
   all, 4190 preserved cephalopod specimens were identified and catalogued
   to produce regional maps of cephalopod distribution within the wider
   Caribbean. Regional species richness was examined with respect to
   Rapoport's rule (RR) and to determine possible cephalopod hotspots in
   the region. Rarefaction curves were used to normalize the samples of
   various size collected throughout the wider Caribbean. Cephalopods of
   the wider Caribbean within latitudinal bands from 8 to 308N do not
   support RR because they exhibit increasing species richness with
   increasing latitude. Eight subareas were chosen to compare species
   richness. Regionally, species richness appears to be patchy, with
   cephalopods concentrated more off the eastern Florida coast. There is a
   need for increased sampling throughout the wider Caribbean. Areas were
   lacking in samples, especially the central and southeastern parts of the
   region. There is a need to explore the systematics, life histories, and

AB The Sepik River is a major contributor of water, sediment and associated
   organic loads to the coastal waters of northern New Guinea. With a
   narrow continental shelf and strong coastal currents,much of this
   exported material is available for long distance transport into the
   Bismarck Sea and beyond. CTD casts and associated instrument data showed
   that the river signature was visible in optical measurements of deep
   profiles from the Sepik Canyon. Discrete water samples were collected in
   clean Niskin bottles for organic analysis. Additional high volume
   samples for lipid classes were collected with Infiltrex samplers
   deployed on a floating mooring, along with two sediment trap arrays set
   at 100 and 260 m depth. The Infiltrex samplers were set at 55, 180, 200
   and 220 in depth in an effort to target the surface layers and those of
   westward flowing water in the New Guinea Coastal Undercurrent (NGCUC).
   The samplers allowed analysis of lipid classes in both dissolved and
   particulate phases.
   Analyses of lignin phenols, hydrocarbons, fatty acids, sterols, and
   n-alcohols in the samples were used to estimate the cycling of the
   organic input from the river system to the coastal waters and possible
   entrainment in the NGCUC. The molecular biomarkers confirmed the Sepik
   River as a significant source of reduced carbon in the near coastal zone
   influenced by the plume. They indicated that ca. 90% of the organic
   carbon delivered to the coastal zone is dispersed or degraded, with only
   about 10% of terrestrial carbon being deposited on to the narrow shelf
   of coastal sediments. The dissolved lignin phenols provided evidence for
   desorption of organics from particles with increasing depth. However,
   this desorption process did not change the C/N ratio of the dissolved
   organic carbon (DOC) in the deep water of the Sepik Canyon. The
   hydrocarbons, sterols and fatty acids showed the change from lipid
   content dominated by phytoplankton in surface layers to zooplankton and
   bacterial biomarkers in deeper waters. The organic biomarkers provided
   evidence that some of the dissolved organic input from the Sepik River
   was injected into fast moving undercurrents. However, concentrations of
   terrestrial biomarkers were diluted and/or degraded to non-detectable
   levels within 100 kin of the source. Crown Copyright (C) 2008 Published

AB In situ sea level data from a shallow pressure tide gauge (mean depth
   3.21 m) at Sao Tome Island, Gulf of Guinea, and altimeter data from
   TOPEX/POSEIDON (T/P) were analyzed and compared. The Texas model, a
   TIP-derived tide model, is used for the tidal correction of altimeter
   data. Sea level anomaly time series from both data sets were low-pass
   filtered by using a Gaussian recurrent interpolation scheme, suppressing
   high-frequency fluctuations of periods much less than 2, months.
   According to the 1992-1993 Sao Tome tide gauge data, a clear seasonal
   signal was observed both in 1992 and in 1993, presenting two sea level
   maxima in February and October and two minima in June and December.
   These sea level variations are consistent with the known seasonal mean
   sea level cycle of the area, most of which can be explained by steric
   sea level changes due to the seasonal cycle of upper 500-m water column
   properties in the Gulf of Guinea. On the basis of the 60-day tow-passed
   tide gauge time series, significant year to year variations were
   observed as well, with a 6.3-cm sea level difference in February (+8.1
   cm in 1992 versus +1.8 cm in 1993) and a 4.4-cm difference in October
   (+4.6 cm in 1992 versus +9.0 cm in 1993). Minimum sea levels, occurring
   just prior to the upwelling season (July-August), were almost the same
   for both years (-9 to -10 cm) but lasted much longer in 1992 (2 months)
   than in 1993 (2 weeks). During the 15-month period of concomitant
   observations, from October 1992 to December 1993, these seasonal and
   year to year sea level variations are remarkably well reproduced by the
   TIP sea level time series, with an rms difference of 2.2 cm and a
   correlation coefficient of 0.88. This result in the equatorial Atlantic
   is consistent with other intercomparisons in the Pacific and Indian
   Oceans. This excellent recovery of the oceanic signal is undoubtedly the
   result of unprecedented high precision of T/P measurements and the
   reliable T/P-derived tide model that is used in the present study.

AB Little is known about the impacts of mine waste disposal, including
   deep-sea tailings, on tropical marine environments and this study
   presents the first account of this impact on deepwater fish communities.
   The Lihir gold mine in Papua New Guinea has deposited both excavated
   overburden and processed tailings slurry into the coastal environment
   since 1997. The abundances of fish species and trace metal
   concentrations in their tissues were compared between sites adjacent to
   and away from the mine. In this study (1999-2002), 975 fish of 98
   species were caught. Significantly fewer fish were caught close to the
   mine than in neighbouring regions; the highest numbers were in regions
   distant from the mine. The catch rates of nine of the 17 most abundant
   species were lowest, and in three species were highest, close to the
   mine. There appears to be limited contamination in fish tissues caused
   by trace metals disposed as mine waste. Although arsenic (several
   species) and mercury (one species) were found in concentrations above
   Australian food standards. However, as in the baseline (pre-mine)
   sampling, it appears they are accumulating these metals mostly from
   naturally-occurring sources rather than the mine waste. Crown Copyright

AB For many Small Island Developing States (SIDS) the cost of producing
   electricity from imported fossil fuels is so high and the cost of
   renewable energy technology has fallen so significantly that
   transitioning towards renewable energy is likely to produce cost
   savings. A recent workshop at NYU School of Law, which brought together
   SIDS utility representatives with a leading renewable energy developer
   and other stakeholders, provided strong support for this prediction.
   Utilities are likely to own the majority of renewable energy assets in
   SIDS and will therefore be the initial custodians of any cost savings
   renewable energy provides. This raises a key policy question: to what
   extent should SIDS utilities pass on these savings to consumers by
   lowering electricity rates? We analyze this overlooked element of energy
   policy and highlight undesirable consequences that complete disbursement
   of the savings to consumers could cause. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All

AB The seagrass Thalassia testudinum evolved under much greater grazing
   pressure than exists today because overexploitation by humans caused the
   severe decline of green turtles Chelonia mydas, the major seagrass
   herbivore in the Caribbean. Understanding the effects of grazing on the
   structure and function of seagrass ecosystems is critical to evaluating
   how ecosystem processes have changed since the major herbivore was
   essentially removed from modern Caribbean seagrass systems. We evaluated
   effects of grazing on the structure and productivity of T. testudinum
   pastures by simulating green turtle grazing in 3 x 3 m plots for 16 mo
   in the central Bahamas and comparing these clipped plots to adjacent
   control (unclipped) plots. Simulated grazing affected the physical
   structure of T. testudinum plots, resulting in a system with reduced
   structural complexity. Simulated grazing resulted in compensatory growth
   in T. testudinum. Clipped plots maintained levels of growth comparable
   to unclipped plots over the 1.6 mo clipping trial, and specific mass
   growth was significantly elevated in clipped plots, even without
   simulating the nutrient return from. green turtle feces and urine. The
   green turtle grazing pattern of re-cropping T. testudinum plots is
   sustainable for long periods-at least 16 mo. We estimated a range of
   carrying capacities of T. testudinum for green turtles of 1567 to 3748
   kg turtle ha(-1). Our study provides a foundation for reconstruction
   models and restoration plans for Caribbean seagrass ecosystems.

AB Unsustainable exploitation of tropical forest resources is raising
   worldwide concern. In Papua New Guinea (PNG) timber harvesting has been
   identified as a major contributor to deforestation and forest
   degradation but its impact on biodiversity is still poorly understood.
   In this study we investigated the effect of selective logging on tree
   taxonomic composition, structure and diversity of PNG forests. We used
   data from 101 one-hectare permanent sample plots (PSPs) belonging to two
   vegetation types: low altitude forests on plains and fans (type P) and
   low altitude forests on uplands (type H). We used multivariate
   techniques to test for significant differences in species composition
   between plots of different vegetation types and disturbance regimes,
   identifying the tree taxa to which these differences could be ascribed.
   ANOVA was used to test for differences between logged-over and unlogged
   forest PSPs with respect to biodiversity (richness, Shannon's diversity,
   Pielou's evenness) and stand structure (stem density, basal area -BA).
   Temporal trends of forest features were analyzed using linear
   regression. Significant differences in taxonomic composition were found
   between logged-over and unlogged plots of the H type (p = 0.04). No
   differences were found in richness, diversity and evenness between
   logged-over and unlogged forest plots, while stem density was higher in
   the latter (421 +/- 153 stems ha(-1)). Greater BA was found in unlogged
   forests (30.28 +/- 4.45 m(2) ha(-1)) of the H type when compared to the
   logged-over stands (15.52 +/- 4.04 m(2) ha(-1)). We detected positive
   trends in richness (0.55 +/- 0.19 taxa ha(-1) yr(-1)) and diversity
   after logging. Furthermore, H type forest exhibited positive trends in
   stem density (9 +/- 1 stems ha(-1) yr(-1)) and BA (0.42 +/- 0.06 m(2)
   ha(-1) yr(-1)) with elapsed time since harvesting. Our analysis
   highlights some significant effects of logging activities on
   biodiversity and structure of PNG forests. Additionally, forests
   exhibited a significant recovery with respect to richness, diversity and
   stand structure. These preliminary results will be compared with data
   collected by the forthcoming National Forest Inventory in order to
   assess and monitor the effects of human activities and ecological
   factors on PNG forest biodiversity and develop appropriate conservation
   measures and sustainable management strategies.

AB Coastal hydrothermal vents in the depth range 0-27 m were studied in
   Matupi Harbour, a marine bight that is partly isolated from the open sea
   on the north-east coast of New Britain, Papua New Guinea, where
   volcanoes are active. Planktonic and benthic communities (including
   bacteria) in the Harbour were compared with adjacent fully marine areas.
   The environmental parameters assessed included temperature, salinity,
   O-2, H-2, hydrocarbons, metals, some species of nitrogen and sulphur,
   inorganic phosphate, silicate and chlorophyll a. There was pronounced
   stratification of the waters in the Harbour as a result of inflow of
   heated volcanic fluids, most evident in the surface 0-3 m layer. The
   volcanic fluids are rich in phytoplankton nutrients and reduced
   compounds which stimulate growth of bacterial plankton, bacterial
   production and enhance primary production. The highest values of
   photosynthetic fixation (almost 100 mg C m(3) d) and bacterial
   production (216 mg C m(3) d) found in the Harbour are much greater than
   previously reported for marine ecosystems. The chemosynthetic fraction
   of bacterial production varied from 15 to 60%, with highest values in
   the surface and the near-bottom layers, The zooplankton in the Harbour
   was dominated by cyclopoid copepods and was low in diversity. Bacterial
   mats were very evident at the areas of venting, dominated by
   Thiodendron-like species, but both epifauna and infauna were sparse at
   the vents. However, areas adjacent to the hydrothermal vents showed the
   richest benthic communities, with epifauna dominated by corals and
   sponges and infauna by nematodes. It appeared that benthic community
   development was inhibited by the hot sediment, rapid sedimentation, lack
   of hard substratum and large numbers of sponge spicules in the sediment.
   From dating of the last major volcanic eruption (1943), the Harbour
   provides an excellent model for studying processes of succession and
   adaptation in marine communities stressed by shallow-water
   gasohydrothermal activity. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights

AB Information on oceanic migrations and spawning areas of tropical Pacific
   freshwater eels (genus Anguilla) is very limited. Lake Letas and its
   single outflowing river, Mbe Solomul on Gaua Island, Vanuatu, were
   surveyed for large migrating individuals. Twenty-four Anguilla marmorata
   (87 to 142 cm), 39 A. megastoma (50 to 131 cm), and 3 A. obscura (119 to
   126 cm) were caught. Seven individuals were tagged with pop-up satellite
   transmitters and released offshore. One A. marmorata migrated 843 km
   towards the South Equatorial Current. The tag surfaced only 330 km from
   the point where the smallest leptocephalus has been captured so far.
   Tags on A. megastoma and A. obscura popped up within the archipelago.
   All 3 species exhibited pronounced diel vertical migrations. Eels
   descended from around 200 m nighttime depth, to 320 (A. obscura), 650
   (A. marmorata), and 750 m (A. megastoma) during the day. A clear impact
   of the lunar cycle on the upper limit of migration depths was found in
   A. marmorata (full moon: 230 m, new moon: 170 m). These behaviours may
   be explained as a trade-off between predator avoidance and the necessity
   to maintain a sufficiently high metabolism for migration.

AB A checklist of benthic ribbon worm species from the Caribbean coast of
   Colombia is presented, including synonyms, distributions, a photographic
   record, and the main morphologic characters of each species for a rapid
   identification. This is the first research focused broadly on nemerteans
   in Colombia. 54 specimens of nemerteans were hand-collected from the
   rocky littoral of two different localities, and identified according to
   personal experience and specialist literature. 13 species were found; of
   which 11 represent new records for the country. These species belong to
   eight different traditionally used families: Tubulanidae, Valenciniidae,
   Lineidae, Amphiporidae, Cratenemertidae, Emplectonematidae,
   Drepanophoridae and Ototyphlonemertidae. The most common and abundant
   species was Dushia atra. The biodiversity of nemerteans in Colombia
   seems to overlap with the nemertean fauna from Florida and Brazil,
   explained by the convergence of the North Brazil Current, Guiana
   Current, Caribbean Currents and the Panama-Colombia Contracurrent in the
   sampled region. The results of this work suggest that the Caribbean
   coast of Colombia is a region with a high diversity of nemerteans, and
   provide important taxonomic data for environmental assessments and
   future biological research.

AB To test flying fox adaptations to a habitat mosaic with extreme
   deforestation, the abundance, habitat choice and feeding behavior of the
   Pacific flying fox, Pteropus tonganus, were investigated across 16
   islands of the Yasawa archipelago, Fiji. The habitat mosaic is formed by
   4.3 percent tropical dry forest and 3.3 percent farmland, leaving exotic
   grasslands and stands of Leucaena leucocephala to overrun the vast
   majority of land. Pteropus tonganus abundance was high (5757 bats)
   despite deforestation and hunting. Roosting sites were restricted to
   native forest fragments. Grasslands and stands of L. leucocephala were
   completely void of bats at all times. The mean foraging density in
   farmland was four times higher than in forests and foraging competition
   was routinely observed in farmland but was extremely rare in forests.
   The author suggests that during the study, extensive foraging in
   farmland was supporting the high P. tonganus population. Additionally,
   the preferential foraging in farmland was responsible for the low
   foraging densities within forests and dramatically less intraspecies
   competition for forest resources. Further research is needed on seed
   dispersal within forests and to test for seasonal variations in bat
   abundance and feeding.

AB The success of coral reefs is due to obligate mutualistic symbioses
   involving invertebrates and photosynthetic dinoflagellate symbionts
   belonging to the genus Symbiodinium. In the Caribbean, the vast majority
   of octocorals and other invertebrate hosts associate with Symbiodinium
   clade B, and more selectively, with a single lineage of this clade,
   Symbiodinium B1/B184. Although B1/B184 represents the most prevalent
   Symbiodinium in the Caribbean, there is little evidence supporting
   fine-scale diversity and host-alga specificity within this lineage. We
   explored simultaneously the questions of diversity and specificity in
   Symbiodinium B1/B184 by sequencing the flanking regions of two
   polymorphic microsatellites from a series of Symbiodinium clade B
   cultures along with Symbiodinium B1/B184 populations of the octocorals
   Pseudopterogorgia elisabethae, P. bipinnata and Gorgonia ventalina.
   Seven unique sequence variants were identified based on concatenation of
   the two loci. Phylogenetic analyses of these variants, which we refer to
   as phylotypes, recognized five as belonging to B1/B184, thus providing
   the first evidence of distinct taxa within this Symbiodinium lineage.
   Furthermore, sympatric P. elisabethae and P. bipinnata at San Salvador
   in the Bahamas were found to harbour distinct Symbiodinium B1/B184
   phylotypes, demonstrating unequivocally the existence of fine-scale
   specificity between Caribbean octocorals and these algae. Taken
   together, this study exemplifies the complex nature of Symbiodinium
   biodiversity and specificity.

AB Recently, an overview of the diversity, abundance, distribution and
   morphological characteristics of spp. of the genus Nesobasis, endemic to
   Fiji, was presented for spp. occurring on the 2 largest islands of the
   archipelago: Viti Levu and Vanua Levu. Here this knowledge is extended
   by providing more extensive diversity and abundance data for the island
   of Vanua Levu, as well as for 4 smaller islands in Fiji: Taveuni, Koro,
   Ovalau and Kadavu. Previous research indicated that the Nesobasis spp.
   inhabiting Viti Levu and Vanua Levu are unique, with these islands
   having no species in common. The new data confirm this proposal and also
   show that smaller islands in proximity to these 2 larger islands usually
   contain a subset of large island's Nesobasis fauna. The isalnd of Koro,
   however, is unusual in that, while its Nesobasis spp. are predominantly
   those found on Vanua Levu, it also harbours N. rufostigma, a sp,
   occurring on Viti Levu. Further, N. recava is endemic to Kadavu and is
   not found on Viti Levu, the nearest large island. Species richness is
   higher on large than small islands while mean species abundances were
   consistently higher on large islands compared to small islands. The
   pattern of distribution and speciation in this genus is quite complex,
   and is the subject of ongoing research.

AB The coexistence of hurricanes, coral reefs, and rainforests in the
   Caribbean demonstrates that highly structured ecosystems with great
   diversity can flourish in spite of recurring exposure to intense
   destructive energy. Coral reefs develop in response to wave energy and
   resist hurricanes largely by virtue of their structural strength.
   Limited fetch also protects some reefs from fully developed hurricane
   waves. While storms may produce dramatic local reef damage, they appear
   to have little impact on the ability of coral reefs to provide food or
   habitat for fish and other animals. Rainforests experience an enormous
   increase in wind energy during hurricanes with dramatic structural
   changes in the vegetation. The resulting changes in forest microclimate
   are larger than those on reefs and the loss of fruit, leaves, cover, and
   microclimate has a great impact on animal populations. Recovery of many
   aspects of rainforest structure and function is rapid, though there may
   be long-term changes in species composition. While resistance and repair
   have maintained reefs and rainforests in the past, human impacts may
   threaten their ability to survive.

AB A standard approach to improving the accuracy of reef fish population
   estimates derived from underwater visual censuses (UVCs) is the
   application of species-specific correction factors, which assumes that a
   species' detectability is constant under all conditions. To test this
   assumption, we quantified detection rates for invasive Indo-Pacific
   lionfish (Pterois volitans and P. miles), which are now a primary threat
   to coral reef conservation throughout the Caribbean. Estimates of
   lionfish population density and distribution, which are essential for
   managing the invasion, are currently obtained through standard UVCs.
   Using two conventional UVC methods, the belt transect and stationary
   visual census (SVC), we assessed how lionfish detection rates vary with
   lionfish body size and habitat complexity (measured as rugosity) on
   invaded continuous and patch reefs off Cape Eleuthera, the Bahamas. Belt
   transect and SVC surveys performed equally poorly, with both methods
   failing to detect the presence of lionfish in > 50 % of surveys where
   thorough, lionfish-focussed searches yielded one or more individuals.
   Conventional methods underestimated lionfish biomass by similar to 200
   %. Crucially, detection rate varied significantly with both lionfish
   size and reef rugosity, indicating that the application of a single
   correction factor across habitats and stages of invasion is unlikely to
   accurately characterize local populations. Applying variable correction
   factors that account for site-specific lionfish size and rugosity to
   conventional survey data increased estimates of lionfish biomass, but
   these remained significantly lower than actual biomass. To increase the
   accuracy and reliability of estimates of lionfish density and
   distribution, monitoring programs should use detailed area searches
   rather than standard visual survey methods. Our study highlights the
   importance of accounting for sources of spatial and temporal variation
   in detection to increase the accuracy of survey data from coral reef
   systems.

   Mexican chondrychthyan fauna are complex with 19.7 % of the species
   being circumglobal, 9.9 % transatlantic, 1.9 % transpacific, and 9.4 %
   endemic to the exclusive economic zone. Additionally, 36.6 % of the

AB Amongst the mid-20th century cultural objects from Papua New Guinea
   (PNG) in a collection of the Art Gallery of New South Wales (AGNSW),
   Australia, is a number of items that are coloured with an unusual blue
   pigment. Many of the paints used for the ceremonial objects originating
   from the PNG Highlands employ a traditional red, yellow, white and black
   palette, so there is interest in the source of a blue pigment of
   apparent natural origin. For this investigation, infrared and Raman
   spectroscopies, in combination with a synchrotron x-ray diffraction
   study, were used to characterise blue pigments obtained from three
   objects in the AGNSW collection. The pigments were identified as
   vivianite-type minerals. The different shades of blue appearing in these
   objects were found to be associated with an early oxidation product of
   vivianite, rather than due to the presence of another mineral in the
   paints. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB [1] The Atlantic Warm Pool (AWP) is a large body of warm water (warmer
   than 28.5 degrees C) that appears in the Gulf of Mexico, the Caribbean
   Sea, and the western tropical North Atlantic during the summer and fall.
   Located to its northeastern side is the North Atlantic Subtropical High
   (NASH) that produces the easterly trade winds in the tropics. The trade
   winds carry moisture from the tropical North Atlantic into the Caribbean
   Sea where the flow intensifies forming the Caribbean Low-Level Jet
   (CLLJ). This paper finds that the easterly CLLJ is maximized in the
   summer and winter, whereas it is minimized in the fall and spring. The
   semi-annual feature of the CLLJ results from the semi-annual variation
   of sea level pressure in the Caribbean region associated with the
   east-west excursion of the NASH. The AWP's impact is to weaken the
   summertime NASH, especially at its southwestern edge and thus weaken the
   easterly CLLJ. The weakening of the easterly CLLJ, in conjunction with
   the AWP-induced change of upper-level wind, reduces the tropospheric
   vertical wind shear that favors hurricane formation and intensification
   during August-October.

   (ODP) Site 999 (12[degree]44[minute]N, 78[degree]44[minute]W, water
   depth 2828 m) spanning the interval from 8.5 to 5.3 Ma. Low epibenthic
   [delta]13C values and low amounts of sand-sized particles (mostly
   foraminifer shells) indicate a poorly ventilated deep Caribbean
   throughout the late Miocene. At this time the deep Caribbean was
   dominated by a nutrient-rich and corrosive water mass. A generally
   constant [delta]13C gradient between the Caribbean and deep Atlantic
   records during the late Miocene suggests that the fluctuations in
   [delta]13C reflect global changes in [delta]13C of the dissolved
   inorganic carbon due to varying erosion of organic carbon from
   terrigenous soils and shelf sediments. The observed 100-kyr cyclicity of
   epibenthic [delta]13C is in good accordance with the variability of
   terrigenous input to the equatorial Atlantic as recorded by magnetic
   susceptibility records of the Ceara Rise. However, some short-term
   gradient changes between 7.0 and 4.5 Ma indicate a poorer ventilation of
   the deep Atlantic related to a reduced production of deep water in the
   Atlantic. The Messinian Salinity Crisis between 6.0 and 5.3 Ma did not
   affect the intermediate to deep water gradient between the Caribbean and
   the Atlantic. Comparison to the Bahama platform record of ODP Site 1006,
   however, indicates a poorer ventilation of the shallower northern
   Caribbean basins coincident with the isolation of the Mediterranean Sea.

   three specimens, is redescribed based on 12 specimens. Symphurus
   holothuriae, previously reported only from the holotype, is a junior
   subjective synonym of S. microrhynchus. Symphurus trifasciatus is
   redescribed based on six specimens, including the lectotype designated
   in this study. Symphurus microrhynchus is distinguished from congeners
   by a combination of meristic features, head and opercle shape,
   dorsal-fin position, and features of its pigmentation. The species
   occurs in relatively shallow tropical waters from Zanzibar through
   French Polynesia (the only reported occurrence of a shallow-water
   Symphurus from a locality on the Pacific Plate), including Indonesia,
   Papua New Guinea, Vietnam, and northwestern Australia. Symphurus
   trifasciatus, known from deep waters along both coasts of the Indian
   subcontinent and adjacent waters, has an overall similarity in body
   shape and meristic features reminiscent of those in S. microrhynchus,
   but differs notably in having a longer and wider head, a distinctive
   opercle shape, number of scale rows on the head, and pigmentation
   pattern.

   the first time. The basic cell components (nucleus, chloroplasts,
   mitochondria, amphiesma, Golgi complex, and accumulative bodies) are
   described. An expanded and updated description of the chloroplasts and
   accumulative bodies is given. Crystalline aggregates characteristic of
   hypnozygotic cysts were found in the genus Ostreopsis for the first
   time. The data are compared with the results of ultrastructural studies
   on Ostreopsis cf. ovata that inhabits the Adriatic and the Caribbean
   seas and the coastal waters of Jeju Island (South Korea). New features
   of the structure of some organelles in Ostreopsis cf. ovata from Russian
   waters were revealed.

AB A wild variety of bitter melon Momordica charantia L (Cucurbitaceae) has
   been used in bush medicine of Trinidad and Tobago for treatment of
   diabetes, inflammations and cancer. Despite many studies regarding the
   cultivated bitter melon, the wild variety has been poorly investigated.
   This study evaluates the biological activities of the ethanol/water
   extract of aerial parts and correlates these activities with the
   presence of phenolic compounds. The extract exhibited antioxidant
   activity in the four assays (DPPH, reducing power, beta-carotene
   bleaching and TBARS). The key role of oxidative stress in inflammation
   and tumorigenesis was supported by the results of anti-inflammatory
   (inhibition of nitric oxide production) and cytotoxicity (human tumor
   cell lines, namely HeLa, HepG2, MCF-7, and NCI-H460) assays. In
   contrast, no toxicity was observed in non-tumor cells. In the
   antibacterial screening, clinical resistant isolates were significantly
   affected (MIC50 = 10-0.625 mu g/mL), being Listeria monocytogenes the
   most susceptible. Three phenolic acids and eleven flavonol glycosides
   derivatives were identified, quercetin-3-O-pentosylhexoside being the
   most abundant. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Grid connected solar photovoltaic (GCPV) systems are fast becoming a
   regular feature of electricity power networks in urban and peri-urban
   areas within most Pacific Island Countries. A number of systems have
   been installed with many in the pipeline. This relatively new
   technology, utilizing the intermittent solar energy resource has
   presented new challenges to small island utilities that were hitherto
   almost completely dependent on diesel generators and hydropower. The
   present paper describes the current status of GCPV systems in the
   Pacific region and reviews some of the issues that arise in the
   deployment of this technology. It also reports a case study involving a
   45 kW(p) GCPV system located at the University of the South Pacific
   (USP) marine campus in Fiji. One of the first two GCPV systems
   established in Fiji, this system has an annual production of similar to
   54,000 kW h and supplies about 10% of the electricity requirements of
   the campus. The actual system performance agreed well with the simulated
   results. This system also reduces USP's annual carbon footprint by more
   than 27,000 kg CO2e. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

   concentrations in Barramundi flesh were determined by graphite furnace
   AAS with matrix modification and platform atomization, following wet
   digestion with nitric and perchloric acids. As and Se were determined by
   hydride generation AAS. Hg was determined by cold vapour AAS. The metal
   concentrations were generally found to be low compared to other
   published results for unpolluted sites. However, mercury concentrations,
   were relatively high and exceeded Australian National Health and Medical
   Research Council (NHMRC, 1987) standards for metals in foods of 0.5 mug

AB The proximity of many Pacific countries to seafood markets in Asia, the
   high value of species associated with coral reefs, and the increased
   demand for marine aquarium species, has prompted many nations in the
   region to investigate opportunities for coastal aquaculture. There are,
   however, several constraints to consider throughout much of the Pacific,
   including, transport problems, fragile ecosystems, lack of suitable
   sites, limited economies, and the effects of customary marine tenure on
   access to growout sites. To overcome these problems, coastal aquaculture
   in the Pacific will need to focus either on species of high value, or
   those that yield non-perishable products. Valuable industries have been
   established for pearl oysters, penaeid shrimps, and the microalgae,
   Spirulina, in tropical Australia, the French territories and Hawaii,
   whereas enterprises for cultured giant clams, milkfish (Chanos chanos)
   as tuna bait, the macroalgae, Eucheuma, and sponges are emerging in the
   small island developing states. Species demanded by the aquarium trade,
   groupers for live reef fish markets, tropical abalone (Haliotidae),
   mangrove crabs (Scylla spp.) and a variety of invertebrates as sources
   of bioactive compounds are promising new species for intensive farming.
   Aquaculture technology is being applied to the restocking and stock
   enhancement of valuable, sedentary species low in the food chain, and
   there are active programmes in several small island developing states to
   assess the scope for releasing cultured giant clams, trochus, green
   snail and sea cucumbers to replenish and enhance wild stocks. There is a
   growing awareness that the potential benefits of increased aquaculture,
   restocking and stock enhancement need to be balanced by the risks
   associated with culturing additional species, i.e. introduction of
   diseases, dilution of gene pools and increased biological interactions
   with other species, and that sustainable aquaculture, restocking and
   stock enhancement are most likely to be achieved with responsible
   application of technology and the use of indigenous species.

AB We studied the bird communities of five contrasting semi-natural
   habitats of Lac Bay, Bonaire, Southeastern Caribbean, during the fall of
   2011. A total of 420 point counts were conducted in five different
   habitats and 63 species were detected. Of these, 31 (49%) were migrants,
   24 (38%) were residents, 6 (10%) occurred both as residents and migrants
   and 2 (3%) were migrants that possibly or irregularly breed. Most
   migratory species were shorebirds and waders (76%). The bird communities
   of the five habitats studied showed significant differences in species
   composition and associated community parameters. Mangrove thicket and
   salt flat habitats had roughly a two-fold higher total species richness
   and a four-fold higher migratory species richness compared to woodland
   habitats. In woodland habitats, breeding residents dominated, whereas
   migratory shore and waterbirds dominated in salt flat habitat. The
   Northern Waterthrush, Parkesia noveboracensis, and Barn Swallow, Hirundo
   rustica, were the numerically most important migratory passerines. The
   Reddish Egret, Egretta rufescens, a globally Near-Threatened species,
   ranked among the top 10 most abundant species of the Lac Bay salt flat
   habitat. Our results suggest that the relatively expansive hypersaline
   wetlands of Bonaire (of which Lac is only a small part) may be of
   special significance to migratory shore and waterbirds. In contrast to
   other areas of the Caribbean, invasive exotic birds so far play a minor
   role in the communities studied.

AB Intense rainfall events can trigger local flooding due to prolonged and
   extended ponding especially in densely urbanized areas with local flat
   spots. The frequency of these events is very high and therefore so is
   their impact on society. In certain cases (i.e., small islands) good
   characterization of this hazard is an important part of the global risk
   assessment of the area.
   In the literature we find a large number of inundation models for
   regional or global applications, as recently this problem has catalyzed
   the attention of the research community, but few of them focus on local
   ponding effects, their primary goal being to assess riverine flood risk.
   This work presents a simple ponding model developed, tested and applied
   in different environments, including a challenging one in the Caribbean
   Islands.
   The model assumes that the interactions among local and far
   morphological features, slope, soil use and soil type allow the
   identification of ponding prone areas.
   In the particular context of the Global Assessment Report (GAR) such a
   model has been of dramatic help in identifying risks in Small Islands
   Developing States (SIDS), which often lack of a well organized river
   network and are exposed to torrential rains, such that local flooding is
   one of the major threats they experience with devastating problems to
   facilities and lifelines.
   The model was at first calibrated and validated in central Italy in the
   area of the L'Aquila city, in a very rich data environment, and after
   that it was ported to the Caribbean Islands in the framework of the GAR.
   The model outputs probabilistic information expressed in terms of
   ponding Likelihood so that this information can be easily taken in a
   probabilistic risk analysis framework. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

AB The protected waters of mangrove lined estuaries are considered nursery
   grounds for many important fisheries species. In the US Virgin Islands
   settlement rates of Panulirus argus pueruli on Witham collectors are
   much higher in near shore estuarine habitats than those placed in off
   shore oceanic waters. In Discovery Bay, Jamaica, settlement of pueruli
   and recruitment of other organisms was higher on the exposed fore reef
   than in the estuarine waters. The lack of pueruli and the low
   recruitment of other organisms on collectors within the protected waters
   of the Discovery Bay estuary may be a function of habitat degradation.
   While much attention is given to over fishing around Discovery Bay,
   degradation of the near shore nursery habitat of Discovery Bay is seldom
   considered a major factor in the decline of local fisheries.

   potential in the Caribbean and to identify the actions and policies that
   could favor its diffusion. We develop a system dynamics simulation model
   for SWAC adoption, and use it to simulate scenarios and incentives for
   SWAC in Jamaica. We found that SWAC adoption is mainly limited by the
   threshold capacity necessary for the first installation. To achieve full
   adoption by 2050, governments and investors should finance 100% of the

AB Issues of mothering and work, though often spoken about in practical
   terms, express deeper concerns about the transmission and acquisition of
   cultural values and the part mothering plays in the creation of the self
   in society. Based on a case study of the Murik of Papua New Guinea and
   recent insights into intersubjectivity and recognition of the
   mother-child relationship, I argue that Murik mothers deploy their
   capacity for subject-subject interaction in ways that teach children
   crucial cultural schemas related to work, food, and recognition. In
   negotiating intersubjectivity, mother and child establish the broad
   outlines of a competent self in a cultural world.

AB Stable isotope records of demosponges from the Caribbean and Coral Sea
   are described for the purpose of studying the influence of fossil fuel
   CO2 on the carbon isotopic composition of dissolved inorganic carbon
   (DIC) in surface water. The slow-growing sponges precipitate calcium
   carbonate in isotopic equilibrium with ambient sea water and are used to
   detect changes in delta(13)C(DIC) from pre-industrial times (early 19th
   century) to the present. We observed similar shapes and ranges in
   delta(13)C curves measured on Caribbean specimens collected from water
   depths of 25, 84 and 91 m as well as a specimen collected in shallow
   waters off New Caledonia. The records reveal a highly significant
   correlation with atmospheric delta(13)C(CO2). delta(13)C(DIC) values for
   Caribbean and Coral Sea surface waters were calculated using the
   delta(13)C sponge records. While delta(13)C of atmospheric CO2 decreased
   by about 1.4 parts per thousand from the early 19th century to 1990,
   delta(13)C(DIC) of Caribbean and Coral Sea surface waters decreased by
   0.9 +/- 0.2 parts per thousand and 0.7 +/- 0.3 parts per thousand,
   respectively. No isotopic equilibrium between surface water DIC and
   atmospheric CO2 was observed, either during the pre-industrial steady
   state or during the last 100 years. The lower amount of depletion in the
   surface water delta(13)C(DIC) With respect to the atmospheric
   anthropogenic signal is explained by the dilution of the surface waters
   by biologically altered subsurface water DIC. The lower delta(13)C
   decrease in the Coral Sea points to a stronger influence of the
   subsurface water source compared to the Caribbean.

AB The Late Cenozoic closure of the seaway between the North and South
   American continents is thought to have caused extensive changes in ocean
   circulation and Northern Hemisphere climate(1-2). But the timing and
   consequences of the emergence of the Isthmus of Panama, which closed the
   seaway, remain controversial(1-5). Here we present stable-isotope and
   carbonate sand-fraction records from Caribbean sediments which, when
   compared to Atlantic and Pacific palaeoceanographic records, indicate
   that the closure caused a marked reorganization of ocean circulation
   starting 4.6 million years ago. Shallowing of the seaway intensified the
   Gulf Stream and introduced warm and saline water masses to high northern
   latitudes. These changes strengthened deep-water formation in the
   Labrador Sea over the next million years-as indicated by an increased
   deep-water ventilation and carbonate preservation in the Caribbean
   Sea-and favoured early Pliocene warming of the Northern Hemisphere. The
   evaporative cooling of surface waters during North Atlantic Deep Water
   formation would have introduced moisture to the Northern Hemisphere.
   Although the pronounced intensification of Northern Hemisphere
   glaciation between 3.1 and 2.5 million years ago substantially lagged
   the full development of North Atlantic Deep Water formation, we propose
   that the increased atmospheric moisture content was a necessary
   precondition for ice-sheet growth, which was then triggered by the
   incremental changes in the Earth's orbital obliquity.

AB Six new monotypic genera and eight new species of hermit crabs of the
   family Paguridae Latreille, 1802 are fully described based on specimens
   obtained during two separate, intensive biodiversity studies on the
   islands of Guadeloupe, Curacao, and Dominica in the Lesser Antilles,
   Caribbean Sea. The study in Guadeloupe utilized a broad variety of
   sampling techniques, including dredging, baited traps, and a
   SCUBA-operated vacuum device; in Curacao and Dominica, a manned
   submersible was used. The high number of new taxa discovered is
   surprising given they were obtained in a relatively small area of the
   Antilles in habitats ranging in depth from shallow water (c. 1 m) to
   deep reefs (250 m). Tissue samples were extracted from most specimens
   for CO1 barcoding and other genetic analyses for future phylogenetic
   investigations. Gene sequences are reported to complement the
   morphological descriptions. The new species are unusual in their minute
   sizes, ranging 0.4-1.5 mm in shield length; and aspects of their
   morphology, in particular gill number and characteristics of male sexual
   tubes, which could not be clearly matched to any of the existing genera
   of Paguridae. The term "micro-pagurid" is introduced for this diverse,
   diminutive fauna of Paguridae (adult shield length <= 1.5 mm),
   discovered living in cryptic habitats and complex deep reef structures
   of these three islands. A brief, preliminary discussion of the possible
   significance of this micro-pagurid diversity, specialized morphology,
   and biogeography is included.

AB Shallow water zooxanthellate coral reefs grade into ecologically
   distinct mesophotic coral ecosystems (MCEs) deeper in the euphotic zone.
   MCEs are widely considered to start at an absolute depth limit of 30m
   deep, possibly failing to recognise that these are distinct ecological
   communities that may shift shallower or deeper depending on local
   environmental conditions. This study aimed to explore whether MCEs
   represent distinct biological communities, the upper boundary of which
   can be defined and whether the depth at which they occur may vary above
   or below 30m. Mixed-gas diving and closed-circuit rebreathers were used
   to quantitatively survey benthic communities across shallow to
   mesophotic reef gradients around the island of Utila, Honduras. Depths
   of up to 85m were sampled, covering the vertical range of the
   zooxanthellate corals around Utila. We investigate vertical reef
   zonation using a variety of ecological metrics to identify community
   shifts with depth, and the appropriateness of different metrics to
   define the upper MCE boundary. Patterns observed in scleractinian
   community composition varied between ordination analyses and approaches
   utilising biodiversity indices. Indices and richness approaches revealed
   vertical community transition was a gradation. Ordination approaches
   suggest the possibility of recognising two scleractinian assemblages. We
   could detect a mesophotic and shallow community while illustrating that
   belief in a static depth limit is biologically unjustified. The switch
   between these two communities occurred across bathymetric gradients as
   small as 10m and as large as 50m in depth. The difference between
   communities appears to be a loss of shallow specialists and increase in
   depth-generalist taxa. Therefore, it may be possible to define MCEs by a
   loss of shallow specialist species. To support a biological definition
   of mesophotic reefs, we advocate this analytical framework should be
   applied around the Caribbean and extended into other ocean basins where
   MCEs are present.

   Chlorophyta, 1 Phaeophyceae (Heterokontophyta) and 39 Rhodophyta. Among
   the biogeographically interesting new records are the green macroalga
   Rhipilia penicilloides N'Yeurt et Keats (previously endemic to the
   islands of Fiji some 1000 km east of new Caledonia) and the brown alga
   Cutleria mollis Allender et Kraft (originally described from Lord Howe
   Island some 1000 km to the south). The red alga Gloiophloea articulata
   Weber-van Bosse, known only from its initial discovery in 1928 from the
   Mascarene Islands in the western Indian Ocean, is now recorded in the
   deep-water channels of the Noumea region of New Caledonia. The widely
   distributed Indian Ocean species Corynomorpha prismatica (J. Agardh) J.
   Agardh has its easternmost distribution record from this area, and
   Dotyella hawaiiensis (Doty et Wainwright) Womersley et Shepley is
   recorded for the first time outside its central-Pacific distribution.
   These new discoveries represent a 12% increase in the total number of
   species (377) that are reliably known from New Caledonia.

AB We compare monthly resolved oxygen isotope records derived from a giant
   bivalve shell, Tridacna gigas and massive Parkes corals collected along
   the northern coast of Papua New Guinea. This intercomparison study
   demonstrates that delta O-18 profiles obtained from these different
   aragonite-secreting organisms collected from within a 30 km range are
   correlated in great detail and record the timing and amplitude of
   seasonal and interannual (ENSO-related) variations in sea surface
   temperature (SST) and water isotopic composition which is closely
   related to rainfall. Furthermore, the T. gigas record is shown to be
   close to isotopic equilibrium with the local sea-water, in contrast to
   the corals which are approximately - 4 parts per thousand offset. These
   results reveal that living and fossil T. gigas clam shells have the
   potential to yield reliable records of past changes in seasonality and
   ENSO variability, as well as mean climate conditions. In particular,
   since the non-porous shells are generally more resistant to diagenesis
   than coral skeletons, they may provide robust estimates of past tropical
   climate for periods and locations where unaltered corals are absent.

   Gulf of Mexico, Caribbean Sea, and Mediterranean Sea. We discovered the
   ciliate on the surface of a whale vertebra deployed at a depth of 5 m in
   Tokyo Bay, Japan. Molecular phylogenetic analyses confirmed that the
   ciliate was identical to Z. niveum reported off Florida, and that the
   ectosymbiont was also identical to the thioautotrophic ectosymbionts of
   Z. niveum reported from the Caribbean Sea and Mediterranean Sea. This is
   the first report of Z. niveum from the Pacific and also the first
   appearance on any animal carcass. These findings indicate that this
   symbiont-harboring ciliate is cosmopolitan and that sunken whale
   carcasses provide a suitable reducing environment for chemosymbiotic
   organisms not only in deep-sea but also in shallow-water environments
   although the host taxa vary among sites.

AB Predation and parasitism are two of the most important sources of
   mortality in nature. By forming groups, individuals can gain protection
   against predators but may increase their risk of being infected with
   contagious parasites. Animals might resolve this conflict by forming
   mixed-species groups thereby reducing the costs associated with
   parasites through a relative decrease in available hosts. We tested this
   hypothesis in a system with two closely related poeciliid fishes
   (Poecilia reticulata and Poecilia picta) and their host-specific
   monogenean ectoparasites (Gyrodactylus spp.) in Trinidad. Fish from
   three different rivers were sampled from single and mixed-species
   groups, measured and scanned for Gyrodactylus. The presence and
   abundance of Gyrodactylus were lower when fish of both species were part
   of mixed-species groups relative to single-species groups. This is
   consistent with the hypothesis that mixed-species groups provide a level
   of protection against contagious parasites. We discuss the importance of
   potentially confounding factors such as salinity and individual fish
   size.

AB Large quantities of African dust are carried across the Atlantic to the
   Caribbean Basin and southern United States where it plays an important
   role in the biogeochemistry of soils and waters and in air quality.
   Dusts' elemental and isotopic composition was comprehensively
   characterized in Barbados during the summers of 2013 and 2014, the
   season of maximum dust transport. Although total suspended insoluble
   particulate matter (TSIP) mass concentrations varied significantly daily
   and between the two summers, the abundances (gelement/g TSIP) of 50
   elements during high-dust days (HDD) were similar. Aerosols were
   regularly enriched in Na, Cu, Zn, As, Se, Mo, Cd, Sn, Sb, and W relative
   to the upper continental crust. Enrichment of these elements, many of
   which are anthropogenically emitted, was significantly reduced during
   HDD, attributed to mixing and dilution with desert dust over source
   regions. Generally, Ti/Al, Si/Al, Ca/Al, Ti/Fe, Si/Fe, and Ca/Fe ratios
   during HDD differed from their respective values in hypothesized North
   African source regions. Nd isotope composition was relatively invariant
   for low-dust days (LDD) and HDD. In contrast, HDD-aerosols were more
   radiogenic exhibiting higher Sr-87/Sr-86, Pb-206/Pb-204, Pb-207/Pb-204,
   and Pb-208/Pb-204 ratios compared to LDD. Generally, Barbados aerosols'
   composition ranged within narrow limits and was much more homogeneous
   than that of hypothesized African source soils. Our results suggest that
   summertime Barbados aerosols are dominated by a mixture of particles
   originating from sources in the Sahara-Sahel regions. The Bodele
   Depression, long suspected as a major source, appears to be an
   insignificant contributor of summertime western Atlantic dust.

   are the dominant hydroids in the outer reef areas and on patch reefs.
   Dynamena cornicina McCrady was common in all areas of the Thalassia
   (turtle grass) beds. Eleutheria dichotoma Quatrefages, Halecium
   speciosum Nutting, and Egmundella grandis Fraser are recorded from the
   Caribbean Sea for the 1st time. Plumularia sp. is probably a growth form
   of P. floridana Nutting, the gonosome of which is undescribed. Halecium
   sp. is undescribed; corynid species, corymorphid species and sertularid
   species are undescribed and appear to belong to new genera.

AB Severe tropical cyclones are a major cause of episodic mortality for
   Pacific Island flying foxes (large fruit bats). Many flying foxes starve
   after forests are stripped of food sources. and hunting by humans may
   also increase in the post-cyclone period. In December 2001, Cyclone Waka
   passed directly over the Vava'u Islands in the Kingdom of Tongal western
   Polynesia. We visited the islands 6 mo later to survey the flying fox
   (Pteropus tonganus) population and assess availability of potential food
   items (fruit and flower) in primary, secondary and plantation forests.
   Less than 20% of the pre-cyclone bat population (surveyed in 1999-2001)
   remained 6 mo after the storm. The density of potential food trees in
   flower or fruit at this time was only 15% of pre-cyclone density, and
   the main species available were different in the two time periods. The
   highest density of potential food trees occurred in secondary forest (26
   flowering or fruiting trees ha(-1)) and plantations (23 ha(-1)); primary
   forest offered the least food (18 ha(-1)). Since 65-70% of the land area
   has been converted to agricultural plantations, this vegetation type had
   the highest absolute number of food-bearing trees - almost seven times
   that of primary forest. Flowering coconuts (Cocos nucifera) were the
   most abundant food source overall and we suggest that this species may
   be important in sustaining flying foxes following severe storms.

AB Fisheries for large pelagic resources are important to Caribbean
   Community (CARICOM) countries. Many countries have been expanding these
   fisheries, and others have expressed the intention to do so. The
   management of tunas and tunalike species in the Atlantic Ocean is the
   mandate of the International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic
   Tunas (ICCAT): Several of these resources are fully or overexploited,
   with most of the catch being taken by large fishing nations of the
   Atlantic and distant water fleets.
   There is an urgent need for CARICOM countries to ensure that they will
   get a fair long-term share of the sustainable yield of large pelagic
   resources in the Atlantic Ocean. ICCAT has recently re-examined the
   criteria and is attempting to improve the process for allocating these
   resources among countries that fish in the Atlantic. CARICOM countries,
   many of them small island developing States (SIDS), have reached a
   common position that differs in several important respects from the
   position of the larger industrialized fishing nations. The principles
   underlying these positions depend on interpretations of clauses in the
   relevant UN Agreements that pertain to the treatment of new participants
   in these fisheries, the provisions for developing states, and the
   capacity for responsible management, as well as other factors.
   Also at issue is the management of stocks of small tuna and tuna-like
   species such as wahoo, Scomberomorus species and blackfin tuna, which
   are less widely distributed than the large tuna and billfish species.
   ICCAT monitors catch trends for most of these small tuna species, but
   their management is best handled by the appropriate regional or
   sub-regional arrangement. CARICOM countries are in the initial stages of
   exploring options for managing those pelagic species within their
   jurisdiction.

PD SEP 1998

AB Recently, the Caribbean snapping shrimp Synalpheus regalis was shown to
   be eusocial by the criteria historically used for honeybees, ants, and
   termites, i.e., colonies contain a single reproducing female and a large
   number of non-breeding "workers." This finding prompted a reexamination
   of several previously puzzling reports of unusual population structures
   in other Synalpheus species. New collections, and observations made by
   students of this genus over the last century, suggest that several
   sponge-dwelling Synalpheus species similarly exhibit overlapping
   generations and monopolization of reproduction by a few individuals, and
   thus that these species may also be eusocial according to classical
   entomological criteria. The evidence for this conclusion includes
   reports of several Caribbean and Indo-Pacific species occurring in large
   aggregations of "juvenile" shrimp accompanied by few or no mature
   females. Here I describe one of these species as Synalpheus chacei. Like
   other members of the gambarelloides species group within this genus, S.
   chacei is an obligate inhabitant of living demosponges, and has been
   collected from at least seven host species in Caribbean Panama, Belize,
   and the Virgin Islands. Stomach contents comprised primarily detritus
   and diatoms, suggesting that S. chacei feeds on material inhaled in the
   host sponge's feeding current. The new species is morphologically
   similar to S. bousfieldi, and is most reliably distinguished from it
   (and indeed, apparently from all other species of Synalpheus) by a
   unique pair of longitudinal setal combs on the dactyl of the minor first
   chela. Like S. regalis, S. chacei lives in colonies of up to several
   dozen individuals of overlapping generations, in which only a single
   female breeds, and is thus likely to be eusocial. Interestingly males of
   S. chacei exhibit an apparent dimorphism in the development of the major
   chela (fighting claw) which may reflect a concomitant differentiation in
   behavior among individuals within a colony.

AB Simple Summary The smallholder poultry industry in Papua New Guinea
   (PNG) has grown rapidly in the last decade. The cost of growing meat
   birds is high, as feed alone makes up to 80% of the total cost of
   production in PNG. Sweetpotato is currently used in a poultry feed as a
   cheaper alternative option compared to the more expensive commercially
   manufactured stockfeed in PNG. The PNG smallholder poultry production
   system involves many families who rear multiple batches of meat birds
   every year. These birds are sold mostly at the farm gate, at local
   provincial markets, or roadside markets. Consumption of contaminated
   chicken meat has been identified as one of the important food vehicles
   for food borne illness. This PNG-based study was conducted to understand
   whether the inclusion of local sweetpotato in poultry feed can influence
   the shedding of pathogens such as Clostridium perfringens, Salmonella
   and Campylobacter without causing negative effects on poultry
   performance. The results of this study releveled that Campylobacter and
   Salmonella levels in the broilers fed with the local sweetpotato diets
   can be influenced with inclusion of enzymes in the feed.
   Abstract In the last decade, research has targeted the evaluation of
   local feed ingredients for use in monogastric diets to alleviate the
   high cost of production of livestock at smallholder levels in Papua New
   Guinea (PNG). The PNG smallholder poultry production system involves
   many families who rear multiple batches of meat birds every year. This
   study was conducted to evaluate the levels of enteric pathogens in the
   caeca of broilers fed with sweetpotato diets with varying levels of
   non-starch polysaccharides (NSP). Selection of a sweetpotato variety for
   use in broiler diets should be based on the total NSP content. In
   particular, varieties with low soluble NSPs are economical to use as
   Apparent Metabolizable Energy (AME) values are within the desired range
   for poultry and there is minimal need to include enzymes to improve NSP
   digestibility. The use of varieties with a low total NSP is also
   advantageous as the numbers of Clostridium perfringens was lower in
   broilers fed with these sweetpotato varieties. The level of
   Campylobacter and Salmonella levels were high in the ceca of birds fed
   with the sweetpotato varieties with high total NSP. These levels can be
   reduced with the inclusion of enzymes. This information will assist in
   the efficient use of local varieties of sweetpotato in PNG by small
   holder poultry farmers for sustainable poultry production and the
   commercial industry.

   sets from a proposed reference site (South Su) and a proposed mine site
   (Solwara 1) to test the hypothesis that there was no difference in

   weighting to adjust taxa-abundance matrices to down-weight the

   Faunal assemblages of 3 habitat types defined by biogenic taxa (2

   20-mu-g per day, 21-mu-g per day, and 15-mu-g per day at harvest,
   postharvest, and preharvest seasons, respectively. More than 43% of the

   Guinean children was 20-mu-g per day, with 87% of the intakes below the
   recommended level for 7- 10 y olds (30-mu-g per day). Statistical
   comparisons of selenium intakes over three seasons for the 51 children
   present in all survey periods revealed that mean intakes were not
   significantly different in survey periods one and two, but decreased
   significantly in survey period three, when expressed per day (p <
   0.002), per MJ (p < 0.003), or per kg (p < 0.001 ). For the Malawian
   children, the four major food groups contributing

   dietary selenium was contributed by local staples (61%), green leaves
   (15%), animal products (12%), and store-bought staples (7%). Intakes
   were lower than some reported for US and Australian children, but higher

AB AimDespite considerable attention to climate change, no global
   assessment of the consequences of sea level rise is available for
   insular ecosystems. Yet, over 180,000 islands world-wide contain 20% of
   the world's biodiversity. We investigated the consequences of sea level
   rise for the 10 insular biodiversity hotspots world-wide and their
   endemic species. This assessment is crucial to identify areas with the
   highest risk of inundation and the number of endemic species at risk of
   potential extinction.
   LocationTen insular biodiversity hotspots including the Caribbean
   islands, the Japanese islands, the Philippines, the East Melanesian
   islands, Polynesia-Micronesia, Sundaland, Wallacea, New Caledonia, New
   Zealand and Madagascar and the Indian Ocean islands (i.e. 4447 islands).
   MethodsWe investigated four scenarios of projected sea level rise (1, 2,
   3 and 6m) on these islands. For each scenario, we assessed the number of
   islands that would be entirely and partially submerged by overlying
   precise digital elevation model and island data. We estimated the number
   of endemic species for each taxon (i.e. plants, birds, reptiles,
   mammals, amphibians and fishes) potentially affected by insular habitat
   submersion using the endemic-area relationship.
   ResultsBetween 6 and 19% of the 4447 islands would be entirely submerged
   under considered scenarios (1-6m of sea level rise). Three hotspots
   displayed the most significant loss of insular habitat: the Caribbean
   islands, the Philippines and Sundaland, representing a potential threat
   for 300 endemic species.
   Main conclusionsWith the current estimates of global sea level rise of
   at least 1m by 2100, large parts of ecosystems of low-lying islands are
   at high risk of becoming submerged, leading to significant habitat loss
   world-wide. Therefore, the threat posed by sea level rise requires
   specific policies that prioritize insular biota on islands at risk as a
   result of near future sea level rise.

AB A Holocene sediment sample from 110 m water depth on the Papuan Shelf
   yielded a population of Nubeculina divaricata (Brady). The most
   significant feature observed was a thin, calcareous, perforate inner
   layer, in addition to the thick, calcareous imperforate or porcelaneous
   outer layer characteristic of the miliolids. Where the uniserial
   chambers embrace the aperture and upper chamber surfaces of the
   preceeding chamber, the inner layer detaches from the outer layer and
   curves upward to attach to the embraced apertural lip or neck. The genus
   Nubeculina Cushman may represent a fundamental taxonomic division within
   the suborder Miliolina Delage and Herouard, based on the presence of
   this extra, perforate layer.

AB The Cuban solenodon (Solenodon cubanus) is one of the most enigmatic
   mammals and is an extremely rare species with a distribution limited to
   a small part of the island of Cuba. Despite its rarity, in 2012 seven
   individuals of S. cubanus were captured and sampled successfully for DNA
   analysis, providing new insights into the evolutionary origin of this
   species and into the origins of the Caribbean fauna, which remain
   controversial. We conducted molecular phylogenetic analyses of five
   nuclear genes (Apob, Atp7a, Bdnf, Brca1 and Rag1; total, 4,602 bp) from
   35 species of the mammalian order Eulipotyphla. Based on Bayesian
   relaxed molecular clock analyses, the family Solenodontidae diverged
   from other eulipotyphlan in the Paleocene, after the bolide impact on
   the Yucatan Peninsula, and S. cubanus diverged from the Hispaniolan
   solenodon (S. paradoxus) in the Early Pliocene. The strikingly recent
   divergence time estimates suggest that S. cubanus and its ancestral
   lineage originated via over-water dispersal rather than vicariance
   events, as had previously been hypothesised.

AB Classical niche theory explains the coexistence of species through their
   exploitation of different resources. Assemblages of herbivores
   coexisting on a particular plant species are thus expected to be
   dominated by species from host-specific guilds with narrow,
   coexistence-facilitating niches rather than by species from generalist
   guilds. Exactly the opposite pattern is observed for folivores feeding
   on trees in New Guinea. The least specialized mobile chewers were the
   most species rich, followed by the moderately specialized semiconcealed
   and exposed chewers. The highly specialized miners and mesophyll suckers
   were the least species-rich guilds. The Poisson distribution of
   herbivore species richness among plant species in specialized guilds and
   the absence of a negative correlation between species richness in
   different guilds on the same plant species suggest that these guilds are
   not saturated with species. We show that herbivore assemblages are
   enriched with generalists because these are more completely sampled from
   regional species pools. Herbivore diversity increases as a power
   function of plant diversity, and the rate of increase is inversely
   related to host specificity. The relative species diversity among guilds
   is thus scale dependent, as the importance of specialized guilds
   increases with plant diversity. Specialized insect guilds may therefore
   comprise a larger component of overall diversity in the tropics (where
   they are also poorly known taxonomically) than in the temperate zone,
   which has lower plant diversity.

AB Submarine landslides can generate tsunamis and cause coastal hazard.
   Because the horizontal scale of submarine landslide is comparable to
   water depth and much smaller than the scale of earthquake fault area,
   the tsunami characteristics is very different from earthquake-generated
   tsunami which is usually approximated as a shallow-water wave. Several
   approaches have been proposed to model the tsunami generation by
   submarine landslides, and they can be grouped into: landslide as fluid
   motion, rigid-body motion, and initial or kinematic water surface
   profiles. Two examples of tsunamis from submarine landslides are
   described. The first one is the 1998 Papua New Guinea tsunami. While the
   tsunami records at far-field, around Japan, were basically reproduced by
   earthquake fault motion, locally large tsunami heights around Sissano
   Lagoon needed additional source such as submarine slumping. The 1741
   Oshima-oshima tsunami in Japan Sea was modeled by a submarine landslide
   associated with sector collapse of the volcano. While the subaerial
   landslide size and volume were not enough to produce the tsunami that
   caused damage as far as Korean coast, tsunami simulation from the
   recently mapped submarine landslide could reproduce the observed tsunami
   heights.

AB Oceanic archipelagos are the ideal setting for investigating processes
   that shape species assemblages. Focusing on keyhole limpets, genera
   Fissurella and Diodora from Cape Verde Islands, we used an integrative
   approach combining molecular phylogenetics with ocean transport
   simulations to infer species distribution patterns and analyse
   connectivity. Dispersal simulations, using pelagic larval duration and
   ocean currents as proxies, showed a reduced level of connectivity
   despite short distances between some of the islands. It is suggested
   that dispersal and persistence driven by patterns of oceanic circulation
   favouring self-recruitment played a primary role in explaining
   contemporary species distributions. Mitochondrial and nuclear data
   revealed the existence of eight Cape Verde endemic lineages, seven
   within Fissurella, distributed across the archipelago, and one within
   Diodora restricted to Boavista. The estimated origins for endemic
   Fissurella and Diodora were 10.2 and 6.7 MY, respectively. Between 9.5
   and 4.5 MY, an intense period of volcanism in Boavista might have
   affected Diodora, preventing its diversification. Having originated
   earlier, Fissurella might have had more opportunities to disperse to
   other islands and speciate before those events. Bayesian analyses showed
   increased diversification rates in Fissurella possibly promoted by low
   sea levels during Plio-Pleistocene, which further explain differences in
   species richness between both genera.

AB Tropical forest managers need detailed maps of forest types for REDD+,
   but spectral similarity among forest types; cloud and scan-line gaps;
   and scarce vegetation ground plots make producing such maps with
   satellite imagery difficult. How can managers map tropical forest tree
   communities with satellite imagery given these challenges? Here we
   describe a case study of mapping tropical forests to floristic classes
   with gap-filled Landsat imagery by judicious combination of field and
   remote sensing work. For managers, we include background on current and
   forthcoming solutions to the problems of mapping detailed tropical
   forest types with Landsat imagery. In the study area, Trinidad and
   Tobago, class characteristics like deciduousness allowed discrimination
   of floristic classes. We also discovered that we could identify most of
   the tree communities in (1) imagery with fine spatial resolution of <= 1
   m; (2) multiseason fine resolution imagery (viewable with Google Earth);
   or (3) Landsat imagery from different dates, particularly imagery from
   drought years, even if decades old, allowing us to collect the extensive
   training data needed for mapping tropical forest types with "noisy"
   gap-filled imagery. Further, we show that gap-filled, synthetic
   multiseason Landsat imagery significantly improves class-specific
   accuracy for several seasonal forest associations. The class-specific
   improvements were better for comparing classification results; for in
   some cases increases in overall accuracy were small. These detailed
   mapping efforts can lead to new views of tropical forest landscapes.
   Here we learned that the xerophytic rain forest of Tobago is closely
   associated with ultramafic geology, helping to explain its unique
   physiognomy. Published by Elsevier B.V.

   relationship between species richness of insectivorous birds and the
   availability of their food resources. Location Elevational gradient
   (200-3,700 m) of Mt Wilhelm (4,509 m a.s.l.), Central Range, Papua New
   Guinea. Taxon Birds. Methods We collected data on bird communities at
   eight sites (500 m elevational increment) during three surveys
   encompassing both dry and wet seasons over a 2-year period. We used
   point counts, mist-netting, and random walks throughout a standardized
   area. We tested three predictors of diversity and all of their
   combinations, in conjunction with sensitivity analyses for spatial
   effects. Habitat complexity (foliage height diversity index) and
   temperature were locally measured; surface area available within 200 m
   elevational intervals was obtained using GIS software. We further
   locally surveyed insect biomass and related it to species richness of
   insectivorous birds. Results Birds displayed a monotonic decline in
   species richness (from 113 to 35 bird species) with increasing
   elevation, and a nested pattern of species loss. The observed patterns
   were best explained by habitat complexity for the insectivores,
   frugivore-insectivores, and total number of bird species. The available
   surface area was the best predictor for frugivorous birds. The mean
   temperature had a high correlation with species richness of all birds
   and gave the best fit of species richness for insectivore-nectarivores
   and pure nectarivores. The biomass of insectivorous birds correlated
   with the biomass of arthropods. We ruled out the possibility that the
   elevational pattern observed in birds could be driven by a single
   phylogenetic radiation. Main conclusions We observed species richness
   patterns correlate well with habitat complexity and mean temperature,
   but mean temperature was not ranked as high as expected. Our results
   thus challenge the generally expected high importance of temperature as
   a regulator of water availability, production, and biochemical process
   that influence species richness, and underscore the importance of
   vegetation structure and the food resources as the driver of observed
   species richness.

AB When the Omura's whale (Balaenoptera omurai) was first described in
   2003, it was known from only three locations: the southern Sea of Japan,
   and the vicinities of the Cocos (Keeling) Islands and Solomon Islands.
   Work over the following decade suggested a range limited to the eastern
   Indo-Pacific, but more recent discoveries in the western Indian Ocean
   and Atlantic Ocean suggested a more widespread range than previously
   thought. Here we use all available sources of information, including
   published papers, unpublished reports, and internet-based accounts,
   substantiated through genetic, morphological, photographic and acoustic
   documentation, to compile accounts of Omura's whales globally. Reports
   increased precipitously since 2015 after publication of the first
   detailed external description of the species, reflecting the impact of
   the recently elevated awareness of the species. We report 161 accounts
   from 95 locales in the waters of 21 range states, and found that the
   species is widely distributed in primarily tropical and warm-temperate
   locations. Currently it is known from all ocean basins with the
   exception of the central and eastern Pacific. The majority of accounts
   remain in the eastern Indo-Pacific suggesting a potentially recent range
   expansion from this region. There is a strong tendency toward a coastal
   and neritic distribution, although there are also several pelagic
   records. A predominantly near-coastal distribution places Omura's whale
   at risk from anthropogenic activities throughout its range, and its
   tropical distribution in often remote and poorly monitored areas makes
   adequately documenting and assessing threats challenging. We assess
   documented threats in light of the reported species' range, and found
   threats from, at minimum, ship strikes, fisheries bycatch and
   entanglement, local directed hunting, petroleum exploration (seismic
   surveys), and coastal industrial development. Current evidence indicates
   that at least some populations are non-migratory with local, potentially
   restricted ranges. Furthermore, there is low genetic diversity
   documented throughout its global distribution. Given the species may be
   characterized by small local populations, it may be particularly
   vulnerable to impacts from existing regional anthropogenic threats. We
   recommend that focused work be conducted to locate and study local
   populations, assess potential population isolation, and determine
   conservation status and specific anthropogenic threats across the
   species' range.

   resulted in the significantly reduced population occupying Mexico today.
   The genetic structure, using microsatellites, shows the presence of two
   populations in Mexico: the Gulf of Mexico (GMx) and Chetumal Bay (ChB)
   on the Caribbean coast, with a zone of admixture in between. Both
   populations show low genetic diversity (GMx: N-A = 2.69; H-E = 0.41 and
   ChB: N-A = 3.0; H-E = 0.46). The lower genetic diversity found in the
   GMx, the largest manatee population in Mexico, is probably due to a
   combination of a founder effect, as this is the northern range of the
   sub-species of T. m. manatus, and a bottleneck event. The greater
   genetic diversity observed along the Caribbean coast, which also has the
   smallest estimated number of individuals, is possibly due to manatees
   that come from the GMx and Belize. There is evidence to support limited
   or unidirectional gene flow between these two important areas. The
   analyses presented here also suggest minimal evidence of a handful of
   individual migrants possibly between Florida and Mexico. To address
   management issues we suggest considering two distinct genetic
   populations in Mexico, one along the Caribbean coast and one in the
   riverine systems connected to the GMx.

AB This review article synthesizes the authors' several decades of
   multidisciplinary natural and social science and applied marine resource
   management experience in the Asia-Pacific region to examine the
   strengthening of coastal and marine resource management and conservation
   using alliances between local communities and external institutions. The
   objective is to assist the design of resource management and
   conservation programs that enhance the capacity of coastal communities
   in Oceania to confront both diminishing marine resources and the effects
   of climate change by providing guidelines for protecting marine
   biodiversity and vulnerable ecosystem functions. This article describes
   a management framework that hybridizes local beliefs and institutions
   expressed in customary management (CM) with such modern management
   concepts as marine protected areas (MPAs) and ecosystem-based management
   (EBM). Hybrid management accommodates the social, political, economic,
   and cultural contexts of Oceanic communities and, compared with recent
   or conventional management approaches, can therefore better address
   fundamental local concerns such as coastal degradation, climate change,
   sea level rise, weak governance, corruption, limited resources and staff
   to manage and monitor marine resources, and increasing poverty. Research
   on the hybridization of management systems demonstrates opportunities to
   establish context-appropriate EBM and/or other managerial arrangements
   that include terrestrial and adjacent coastal-marine ecosystems Formal
   and informal CM systems are widespread in Oceania and in some parts of
   Southeast Asia, and if appropriate strategies are employed rapid
   progress toward hybrid CM-EBM could be enabled.

AB A new data set of landslides that caused loss of life in Latin America
   and the Caribbean in the 10-year period from 2004 and 2013 inclusive has
   been compiled, providing new insight into the impact of landslides in
   this key part of the world. This data set indicates that in the 10-year
   period a total of 11 631 people lost their lives across the region in
   611 landslides. The geographical distribution of the landslides is
   highly heterogeneous, with areas of high incidence in parts of the
   Caribbean (most notably Haiti), Central America, Colombia, and southeast
   Brazil. There is significant interannual variation in the number of
   landslides, with the El Nino/La Nina cycle emerging as a key control.
   Our analysis suggests that on a continental scale the mapped factors
   that best explain the observed distribution are topography, annual
   precipitation and population density. On a national basis we have
   compared the occurrence of fatality-inducing landslide occurrence with
   the production of locally authored research articles, demonstrating that
   there is a landslide research deficit in Latin America and the
   Caribbean. Understanding better the mechanisms, distribution causes and
   triggers of landslides in Latin America and the Caribbean must be an
   essential first step towards managing the hazard.

AB Veliger larvae of the large gastropod Strombus gigas (queen conch) were
   collected over a 7-y period at a reproductive site in the Exuma Sound,
   in adjacent tidal inlets, and on the Great Bahama Bank near Lee Stocking
   Island, Exuma Gays: Bahamas. Although the spawning season for queen
   conch in the region occurs from April through October, larval abundance
   was highest during mid summer, between late June and August, when
   temperatures were >28 degrees C. Metamorphically competent larvae were
   most abundant in July and August and made up a small percentage of the
   total count, reflecting high natural mortality. Although there was
   considerable interannual variation, veliger densities near Lee Stocking
   Island (typically 1-2 individuals/10 m(3)) were much higher than
   estimates made in the eastern Caribbean and Florida Keys. Because most
   of the collected larvae were newly hatched, regional differences in
   larval abundance appear to be associated with size of local spawning
   stock. Highest densities of larvae were found on the Great Bahama Bank
   directly associated with axes of tidal currents and decreased with
   distance onto the bank. Intensive sampling in one tidal flow field
   showed that total larval densities as well as densities of late-stage
   veligers were highest at a well-established nursery site. Larval
   transport and retention may explain the general occurrence of nurseries
   at locations where water from the Exuma Sound flows onto the Great
   Bahama Bank on flood tides. Large, stable aggregations of juvenile queen
   conch were consistently supplied with high densities of larvae and were
   directly associated with tidal pathways. In contrast, more ephemeral
   aggregations were characterized by low or inconsistent veliger densities
   (particularly lace-stage larvae) and were generally outside primary
   tidal current pathways. Queen conch distribution appears to be directly
   related to the horizontal supply of larvae.

   characteristics of their waters and their origin. These regions, which
   abound with fish communities having well defined and at times quite
   discrete features that cannot be attributed to geographical barriers but
   to environmental or ecological conditions, are: (1) The Atlantic
   platform, including the Gulf of Paria, directly influenced by the runoff
   of the Orinoco River and the Guayana tributaries. (2) The fertility area
   along the continental platform off the northeastern coastline,
   comprising the islands of Margarita, Coche, and Cubagua, awash with both
   periodic coastal upwelhng during the dry season and the Orinoco
   contributions during the rainy season. (3) The oceanic front, with scant
   or nonexisting coastal upwelling or significant fresh water discharge,
   featuring the central area ("litoral central"), where the continental
   shelf is practically nonexistent, and the region encompassing the
   islands in the open ocean, especially that around the Los Roques
   Archipelago, Las Aves of Barlovento and Sotavento, La Orchila, and the
   transition islands, Los Monjes, La Tortuga, La Blanquilla, and Los
   Testigos, all partially affected by the upwelling phenomenon, the latter
   two still within the reach of the Orinoco. (4) The great estuarine areas
   of the Caribbean Sea and their zone of influence, fundamentally the
   Maracaibo System and great part of the western area of the Gulf of
   Venezuela, whose ichthyofauna, on the one hand, partially resembles that
   of the Orinoco Delta, and on the other presents characteristics peculiar
   to the zone. Approximate figures representing the differing ecoregions
   are given and a general comparative discussion is provided. A brief

AB Phytoplankton blooms are sporadic events in time and are isolated in
   space. This complex phenomenon is produced by a variety of both natural
   and anthropogenic causes. Early detection of this phenomenon, as well as
   the classification of a water body under conditions of bloom or
   non-bloom, remains an unresolved problem. This research proposes the use
   of Inherent Optical Properties (IOPs) in optically complex waters to
   detect the bloom or non-bloom state of the phytoplankton community. An
   IOP index is calculated from the absorption coefficients of the colored
   dissolved organic matter (CDOM), the phytoplankton (phy) and the
   detritus (d), using the wavelength (lambda) 443 nm. The effectiveness of
   this index is tested in five bloom events in different places and with
   different characteristics from Mexican seas: 1. Dzilam (Caribbean Sea,
   Atlantic Ocean), a diatom bloom (Rhizosolenia hebetata); 2. Holbox
   (Caribbean Sea, Atlantic Ocean), a mixed bloom of dinoflagellates
   (Scrippsiella sp.) and diatoms (Chaetoceros sp.); 3. Campeche Bay in the
   Gulf of Mexico (Atlantic Ocean), a bloom of dinoflagellates (Karenia
   brevis); 4. Upper Gulf of California (UGC) (Pacific Ocean), a diatom
   bloom (Coscinodiscus and Pseudo-nitzschia) and 5. Todos Santos Bay,
   Ensenada (Pacific Ocean), a dinoflagellate bloom (Lingulodinium
   polyedrum). The diversity of sites show that the IOP index is a suitable
   method to determine the phytoplankton bloom conditions.

PY 2001
AB Blue-and-gold macaws (Ara ararauna), once found in the Nariva Swamp in
   Trinidad, were extirpated in the 1960's because of nest poaching for the
   pet trade and habitat alteration. In 1993, the Forestry Division of
   Trinidad and Tobago, The Centre for the Rescue of Endangered Species of
   Trinidad and Tobago (CRESTT) and the Cincinnati Zoo and Botanical Garden
   embarked on a mission to restore this species to its island habitat.
   Food source and nest site surveys indicated that this now protected
   wetland could still support a population of reintroduced Blue-and-gold
   macaws. After several unsuccessful attempts to obtain chicks for release
   through captive breeding, a pilot study on the reintroduction of
   wild-caught birds was implemented. In 1999, nine potential pairs (18
   birds) were imported from stable wild populations in Guyana. After
   quarantines, testing and physical examinations, the birds spent four
   weeks in a pre-release flight cage located in a protected wildlife
   sanctuary within the Nariva Swamp. They were monitored by local
   villagers and introduced to natural foods of the area. Over a period of
   three months, 14 birds were released (eight males and six females). More
   than one-year later, nine macaws continue to be sighted in the wild.
   Behavioral observations of six of these birds during February to May
   2001 suggest nesting activity. Trained local villagers in the
   communities bordering the swamp have been monitoring flight patterns and
   potential nesting sites of the released birds. Education programs have
   helped rural communities and schools to learn more about the sustainable
   use of the Nariva wetlands. Private and corporate sponsors and the media
   have raised public awareness island-wide to the significance of this
   conservation effort.

   the food security and livelihoods of the populations. By analyzing data
   on current and potential catch and computing the potential catch losses
   from the Exclusive Economic Zones (EEZs) of SIDS, we find that,
   collectively, SIDS have currently overfished their waters to the extent
   that their current catch is just under 50 per cent of the maximum catch
   potential. This catch loss results in direct and indirect food security
   impacts in terms of losses in healthy, varied and nutrient-rich food,
   revenues, incomes and economic impacts in SIDS. Our results also
   demonstrate that capacity-enhancing subsidies contribute to overfishing
   while the effect of good subsidies is unclear and needs further
   analysis.

AB The improper disposal of used frying oil (UFO) presents numerous
   ecological, environmental and municipal problems. Of great concern is
   the resultant blockage of municipal drainage systems and water treatment
   facilities, harm to wildlife when they become coated in it and detriment
   to aquatic life and ecosystems due to the depletion of the oxygen
   content in water bodies such as rivers and lakes that have become
   contaminated. Statistics show that in Trinidad and Tobago, in excess of
   one million liters of used cooking oil is collected annually from
   various restaurant chains. This paper investigated the potential of
   using UFO as a performance enhancing additive for road paving
   applications utilizing Trinidad Lake Asphalt (TLA) and Trinidad
   Petroleum Bitumen (TPB) as a mitigation strategy for improper UFO
   disposal. Modified blends containing various additions of UFO (2-10% wt)
   were prepared for the TLA and TPB asphaltic binders. Results
   demonstrated in terms of stiffness, increasing the dosage of UFO in TLA
   and TPB base binders resulted in a gradual decrease in stiffness (G*
   value decreased). In terms of elasticity, increasing the dosage of the
   UFO additive in TLA resulted in a general decrease in the elasticity of
   the blends indicated by an increase in phase angle or phase lag (delta).
   Increasing dosages of the UFO additive in TPB resulted in a significant
   decrease in d where the most elastic blend was at the 6% UFO level. TLA
   and UFO-TLA modified blends exhibited significantly lower values of d
   and higher values of G* confirming the superiority of the TLA material.
   Incorporation of the UFO in the blends led to a decrease in the rutting
   resistance and increase in the fatigue cracking resistance (decrease in
   G*/sin delta and G*sin delta, respectively). This study highlighted the
   potential for the reuse of UFO as an asphalt modifier capable of
   producing customized UFO modified asphaltic blends for special
   applications and confirms its feasibility as an environmentally
   attractive means of reusing the waste/hazardous UFO material locally.

   from four depths, shallow (3-10 m), medium (15-25 m), deep (30-50 m) and
   very deep (60-90 m) from Little Cayman Island (LCI), Lee Stocking Island
   (LSI), Bahamas and San Salvador (SS), Bahamas which range in distance
   from 170 to 1,600 km apart. Using AMOVA analysis there were significant
   differences in Phi(ST) values in pair wise comparisons between LCI and
   LSI. Among depths at LCI, there was significant genetic differentiation
   between shallow and medium versus deep and very deep depths in contrast
   there were no significant differences in Phi(ST) values among depths at
   LSI. The assignment program AFLPOP, however, correctly assigned 95.7% of
   the LCI and LSI samples to the depths from which they were collected,
   differentiating among populations as little as 10 to 20 m in depth from
   one another. Discriminant function analysis of the data showed
   significant differentiation among samples when categorized by collection
   site as well as collection depth. F-ST outlier analyses identified 2
   loci under positive selection and 3 under balancing selection at LCI. At
   LSI 2 loci were identified, both showing balancing selection. This data
   shows that adult populations of M. cavernosa separated by depths of tens
   of meters exhibits significant genetic structure, indicative of low
   population connectivity among and within sites and are not supplying
   successful recruits to adjacent coral reefs less than 30 m in depth.

AB The authors investigated the upper-ocean currents in the Bismarck Sea
   and related oceanic thermal changes in the western equatorial South
   Pacific for December 2001 January 2002; during this period, coastal
   upwelling occurred along the Papua New Guinea (PNG) coast. Southeastward
   and northwestward coastal currents toward the central PNG coast appeared
   along northern and southern PNG, respectively. In addition, westward
   currents extended toward central PNG in the southern part of the
   Bismarck Sea. A northeastward outflow toward the equator from the PNG
   coastal area, which is compensated for by such flows, was also found.
   Volume budget analysis in the upper ocean showed that, during the
   analysis period, the northeastward outflow ranged from +1.0 to +2.0 Sv
   (1 Sv equivalent to 10(6) m(3) s(-1)). This northeastward outflow
   brought relatively cool coastal water, which is related to PNG coastal
   upwelling, to the western equatorial South Pacific near PNG during this
   period. In addition, the upper-ocean temperature in this region showed a
   cooling tendency in line with a negative heat transport from the PNG
   coastal region. The present results indicate that northeastward
   transport of the cold water is related to the complicated upper-ocean
   currents in the Bismarck Sea and may have strongly affected the
   upper-ocean thermal change in the western equatorial Pacific near PNG
   for December 2001 January 2002.

AB The discussion of quality issues in Papua New Guinea requires that
   attention be focused on what is known about the actual quality of the
   health care provided in Papua New Guinea. Since 1987 there has been
   increasing evidence that there are serious deficits in the quality of
   care in rural areas and that there are similar problems in the country's
   hospitals. This paper summarizes what is known and discusses the
   implications for the development of quality assurance activities in
   Papua New Guinea. The paper concludes that many of the deficiencies
   observed are amenable to improvement through simple and inexpensive
   means and that with sustained commitment, improvements are achievable.

AB The climate dynamical controls on rainfall oxygen isotope values (delta
   O-18(rain)) are poorly constrained in most areas. In Central America,
   rainfall variations are associated with sea surface temperature
   anomalies in the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans, yet the response in delta
   O-18(rain) has not been adequately investigated. Analysis of a 30- year
   time series of delta O-18(rain) in Panama was used to test the
   hypothesis that delta O-18(rain) variations are forced by anomalies in
   rainfall and sea surface temperatures (SSTAs) in the bordering tropical
   oceans. The results show that delta O-18(rain) values in Panama are
   positively (negatively) correlated with SSTAs in the Pacific Ocean
   (Caribbean Sea). The data are consistent with a dominant ' amount
   effect' whereby lowest delta O-18(rain) values are associated with a
   northerly position of the Intertropical Convergence Zone when regional
   rainfall is high. The source effect (Caribbean vs. Pacific), as
   constrained by wind direction, does not appear to be an important
   control on the temporal variations in delta O-18(rain). Citation:

   organic carbon (POC), particulate organic nitrogen (PON), and
   chlorophyll a were high in reef waters and decreased toward the open
   ocean. At the reef edge, concentrations of organic particles in outgoing
   waters were higher than those in incoming waters, indicating net export
   of organic matter. Sediment trap observations conducted off the barrier
   reef showed a larger vertical flux of POC at an inshore station (2.5 km
   off the reef edge) than that at an offshore station (20 km),
   attributable to the net export of organic particles. Organic/inorganic
   carbon ratios of particles trapped at a depth of 45 m in the lagoon were
   smaller than those of suspended particles in surface water, suggesting a
   rapid decomposition of organic matter during sedimentation and a
   resuspension of carbonate-dominant bottom sediments.

AB Oil palm cultivation has environmental impacts, including those
   associated with nitrogen (N) losses. Improving management practices to
   optimise yield and N losses is critical. In order to identify the key
   management and site parameters driving yield and N losses, over a
   25-year cycle, we undertook a Morris's sensitivity analysis of the
   Agricultural Production Systems sIMulator oil palm model (APSIM-Oil
   palm), using 3 sites in Papua New Guinea. We selected 12 parameters and
   3 outputs: yield, nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions and N leaching. The
   influence of the 12 parameters on the outputs depended on site
   characteristics, age of the palms, and climate. The most influential
   parameters for losses were N mineral fertiliser rate, drainage and
   fraction of legume in groundcover vegetation. The simulations suggested
   that APSIM-Oil palm is a useful tool for assessing management options
   for optimising yield and environmental outcomes in different
   environments. The results can also guide future measurements needed to
   improve N loss estimates, and further development of models and risk
   indicators.

AB Vulturine Parrots Psittrichas fulgidus are endemic to the island of New

   species mostly occurs 500 to 1800 m a.s.l. Observations suggest the
   species occurs in low densities. The species is a highly specialized
   frugivore feeding on just a few species of figs (Ficus, Moraceae). These
   parrots are heavily exploited (often by destroying scarce nesting
   cavities) in Papua New Guinea for their feathers, used in traditional
   adornment. This practice might not be sustainable and four possible
   conservation measures are suggested: (i) increase field studies; (2)
   restrict transport of live birds on domestic flights; (3) replace use of
   Psittrichas feathers with dyed chicken feathers; (4) instruct tourists
   not to purchase handicrafts containing Psittrichas or other animal

AB The red lionfish (Pterois volitans) and devil fire-fish (Pterois miles)
   are invasive species that pose a threat to the biodiversity and
   stability of coral reefs in the Western Atlantic, Gulf of Mexico and
   Caribbean Sea. Species identification of lionfish is uncertain in some
   parts of Cuba, and research has mainly been focused on their biology and
   ecology. The principal aim of this study was to determine highly
   polymorphic markers (Inter Simple Sequence Repeat, ISSR) that could be
   used in research on lionfish population genetics in addition to
   confirming the presence of Pterois species in the Guanahacabibes
   National Park. The genetic profile or "fingerprint" of individuals
   collected in Mexico, formally identified as P. volitans, was compared
   with the genetic profile of specimens from Cuba. There were very few
   "diagnostic bands" and a high number of "common bands", demonstrating
   that the same species exists in both countries. Furthermore, Nei's
   genetic distance and the unrooted tree do not show significant
   differences between both localities. In light of these results, we can
   confirm the presence of P. volitans in the Guanahacabibes National Park,
   Cuba. This study demonstrates the functionality of ISSR as a molecular
   tool for species identification and their application for genetic
   population studies of this invasive fish species.

AB Little evidence is available on how juvenile fishes utilise seagrass
   beds and adjacent mangroves as feeding habitats. In this study we tested
   the degree to which Caribbean mangroves are utilised as feeding grounds
   by the fish community from adjacent seagrass beds. Stable carbon and
   nitrogen isotope analyses were performed on several potential food items
   from seagrass beds and adjacent mangroves, on muscle tissue of 23 fish
   species from seagrass beds on a Caribbean island (Curacao, Netherlands
   Antilles), and on juveniles of 2 common reef fish species, Haemulon
   flavolineatum and Ocyurus chrysurus, from seagrass beds in 7 bays on 5
   Caribbean islands. Only the herbivore Acanthurus chirurgus and the
   carnivore Haemulon chrysargyreum appeared to feed predominantly in the
   mangrove habitat, whereas the carnivores Mulloidichthys martinicus and
   O. chrysurus (only on 2 islands) showed a stable carbon signature
   suggestive of food intake from the mangrove as well as the seagrass
   habitat. The piscivore Sphyraena barracuda foraged on fish schooling at
   the mangrove/seagrass interface. For the other 18 seagrass fish species,
   which contributed 86 % of the total seagrass fish density, the
   contribution of food sources from the mangroves was minor to negligible.
   The same was true for H, flavolineatum and 0, chrysurus on most of the
   other Caribbean islands. The results contrast with the situation in the
   Indo-Pacific, where intertidal mangroves serve as important feeding
   habitats for fishes from adjacent systems during high tide. This
   difference is most probably explained by both the absence of large tidal
   differences on Caribbean islands and the greater food abundance in
   seagrass beds than in mangroves.

   derived tsunami sources are input into a fourth order Boussinesq water
   wave simulation code (Geowave) capable of capturing wave dissipation,
   wave breaking, wave dispersion, and nonlinear wave activity. When the
   tsunami source is known, almost all tsunami observations can be captured

   The endemic subspecies of the Near-Threatened Gulf of Guinea thrush
   occurred at a density of 0.08 birds ha(-1), which is far lower than its
   sister subspecies on the neighbouring island of Sao Tome. We also
   present evidence that the effects of access routes around the protected
   area exert an influence on bird species within the National Park. The
   grey parrot, which still suffers from illegal hunting, was more likely
   to be encountered further away from roads. with 25% of variation in its
   occurrence explained by distance to the nearest road. In addition, the
   occurrence of all four threatened species was more likely further from
   access routes. Careful consideration must therefore be given to the
   potential impacts within the National Park of developments outside the
   currently protected area.

AB In benthic communities sponges commonly outcompete other organisms in
   the race for suitable space. Superior competitive ability allows them to
   grow and overgrow other sessile organisms, some of these being
   octocorals. Acquiring substratum space, a resource often more limiting
   than food, is the obvious benefit of these competitive interactions.
   However, sponges that overgrow larger structures such as branching
   octocorals also change their position in the water column, and
   potentially their access to food and exposure to grazers. This study
   explored the potential benefit of spongeoctocoral associations by
   examining the effect of height off the bottom on growth of two species
   of ropelike demosponges under natural conditions. The growths of
   Amphimedon compressa and Iotrochota birotulata were monitored over
   12months at Cross Harbour, Great Abaco, The Bahamas, using small (5-cm)
   sponge fragments that were established at three heights above the bottom
   (05, 30, 60cm). Growth rates differed among the two species and among
   different heights. Over 12months, the mean volumetric growth for
   A.compressa was 17.7cm3 +/- 1.4 compared with 8.9cm3 +/- 1.4 for
   I.birotulata. Both species had a higher growth rate at the 60-cm level.
   These results suggest that these ropelike sponges benefit from their
   association and growth on octocorals, not only by using the octocoral
   skeletal axis as support, but also by acquiring exposure to higher water
   flow.

AB Kosrae, Federated States of Micronesia, is a prototype of an island
   economy prone to economic crowding. Average family size is large, the
   habitable land area is small, economic activity is limited, and
   household dependence on natural resources for fuel and food is high. We
   analyze how economic crowding-and its mitigation through trade and
   migration policies-affects mangrove resource use. A comparison of
   household survey data from 1996 and 2000 indicates that despite
   decreases in US aid and public-sector jobs, average household
   consumption of mangrove resources has not increased. Migration and
   remittances have allowed the purchase of imported fuel and building
   materials substituting for mangrove wood. Despite changing preferences
   and shifts toward import consumption, population growth and further
   declines in US financial support will likely cause aggregate demand for
   mangrove and upland wood to rise. Moreover, continued emigration may
   accelerate the export of mangrove crabs to off-island Kosraeans.

AB The characterization of Pacific Islands as especially vulnerable to
   climate change often undervalues the cultural resilience of their
   inhabitants. On many Micronesian islands, coastal stone-built structures
   are the most visible type of tangible cultural resilience and have
   endured for perhaps 1000 years or more. A distinction is recognized
   between older structures, likely built in response to sea-level rise
   during the Medieval Warm Period (AD 750-1250), and more recent
   structures that likely took advantage of the lowered sea level during
   the Little Ice Age (AD 1350-1800). Detailed studies of Micronesian
   responses to recent coastal change were undertaken in the islands of Yap
   (Proper). The positioning and maintenance of coastal men's houses
   (faluw) reflect either pragmatic responses to unmanageable coastal
   change or a cultural determination to resist this. The long history of
   traditional responses to climate variability and coastal change for
   terrestrial food production on Yap is also discussed. Future adaptation
   pathways on Yap and other higher islands in Micronesia need to combine
   scientific knowledge of climate change with traditional responses to
   historical change, including the stonework tradition and the cultural
   determination to resist undesired coastal change.

AB The El Nio Southern Oscillation (ENSO) phenomenon is a natural part of
   the global climate system resulting from the interactions between
   large-scale ocean atmospheric circulation processes in the equatorial
   Pacific and Indian Oceans. In Guyana, for all the adverse weather and
   extreme hydrological events, the blame goes to El Nio or La Nia. This
   paper investigates the relationship between ENSO and three Guyanese
   river flows; the Demarara, Essequibo and Mazaruni. This work sheds some
   light on the effects of this phenomenon on these river flows which may
   be useful for the adaptation policies dealing with the impacts of ENSO.

AB The development of a sandfish (Holothuria scabra) mariculture industry
   within Papua New Guinea (PNG) is of great socio-economic importance.
   However, the lack of knowledge surrounding the current population
   genetic structure throughout the region has raised concern about the
   genetic impacts of hatchery-augmented sea ranching on already diminished
   wild populations. The present study evaluated the current population
   genetic structure of sandfish within PNG, and more broadly across
   northern Australia, to inform sustainable mariculture practices and
   provide baseline genetic data within these regions. Microsatellite-based
   population genetic analyses were used to determine the genetic diversity
   within subpopulations. This analysis found that although microsatellite
   loci varied widely in the number of alleles (3-28), the overall allelic
   diversity was similar among all populations sampled. The level of
   genetic substructuring among all populations sampled was low, although
   significant (F-ST = 0.037, P = 0.000). Most of these differences were
   driven by distinctness of the Australian populations from those in PNG,
   whereby results indicated that PNG populations exhibited a panmictic
   stock structure. No distinct patterns of genetic isolation by distance
   were detected among the populations examined. Information obtained from
   the present study will improve the management of restocking programs and
   support a sustainable future for the PNG sandfish mariculture industry.

   and Arrecife Alacranes (7.2 bits/ind.) in Campeche Sound. High levels of
   affinity between the sites belonging to the same region, were recorded
   which is discussed on the basis of each system. The spatial distribution
   given by the PCA shows also groups that characterized to some system

AB The studies on marine copepods of Costa Rica started in the 1990's and
   focused on the largest coastalestuarine systems in the country,
   particularly along the Pacific coast. Diversity is widely variable among
   these systems: 40 species have been recorded in the Culebra Bay
   influenced by upwelling, northern Pacific coast, only 12 in the Gulf of
   Nicoya estuarine system, and 38 in Golfo Dulce, an anoxic basin in the
   southern Pacific coast of the country. Freshwater environments of Costa
   Rica are known to harbor a moderate diversity of continental copepods
   (25 species), which includes 6 calanoids, 17 cyclopoids and only two
   harpacticoids. Of the +100 freshwater species recorded in Central
   America, six are known only from Costa Rica, and one appears to be
   endemic to this country. The freshwater copepod fauna of Costa Rica is
   clearly the best known in Central America. Overall, six of the 10 orders
   of Copepoda are reported from Costa Rica. A previous summary by 2001 of
   the free-living copepod diversity in the country included 80 marine
   species (67 pelagic, 13 benthic). By 2009, the number of marine species
   increased to 209: 164 from the Pacific (49% of the copepod fauna from
   the Eastern Tropical Pacific) and 45 from the Caribbean coast (8% of
   species known from the Caribbean Basin). Both the Caribbean and Pacific
   species lists are growing. Additional collections of copepods at Cocos
   Island, an oceanic island 530 km away of the Pacific coast, have
   revealed many new records, including five new marine species from Costa
   Rica. Currently, the known diversity of marine copepods of Costa Rica is
   still in development and represents up to 52.6% of the total marine
   microcrustaceans recorded in the country. Future sampling and taxonomic
   efforts in the marine habitats should emphasize oceanic environments
   including deep waters but also littoral communities. Several Costa Rican
   records of freshwater copepods are likely to represent undescribed
   species. Also, the biogeographic relevance of the inland copepod fauna
   of Costa Rica requires more detailed surveys.

AB Water that forms the Florida Current, and eventually the Gulf Stream,
   coalesces in the Caribbean from both subtropical and equatorial sources.
   The equatorial sources are made up of, in part, South Atlantic water
   moving northward and compensating for southward flow at depth related to
   meridional overturning circulation. Subtropical surface water contains
   relatively high amounts of radiocarbon (C-14), whereas equatorial waters
   are influenced by the upwelling of low C-14 water and have relatively
   low concentrations of C-14. We use a 250 year record of Delta C-14 in a
   coral from southwestern Puerto Rico along with previously published
   coral Delta C-14 records as tracers of subtropical and equatorial water
   mixing in the northern Caribbean. Data generated in this study and from
   other studies indicate that the influence of either of the two water
   masses can change considerably on interannual to interdecadal time
   scales. Variability due to ocean dynamics in this region is large
   relative to variability caused by atmospheric C-14 changes, thus masking
   the Suess effect at this site. A mixing model produced using coral Delta
   C-14 illustrates the time varying proportion of equatorial versus
   subtropical waters in the northern Caribbean between 1963 and 1983. The
   results of the model are consistent with linkages between multidecadal
   thermal variability in the North Atlantic and meridional overturning
   circulation. Ekman transport changes related to tradewind variability
   are proposed as a possible mechanism to explain the observed switches
   between relatively low and high Delta C-14 values in the coral
   radiocarbon records.

AB Compiled abundances of juvenile corals revealed no change over time in
   the Pacific, but a decline in the Caribbean. Using these analyses as a
   rationale, we explored recruitment and post-settlement success in
   determining coral cover using studies in the Caribbean (St John,
   Bonaire) and Pacific (Moorea, Okinawa). Juvenile corals, coral recruits,
   and coral cover have been censused in these locations for years, and the
   ratio of juvenile (J) to recruiting (R) corals was used to measure
   post-settlement success. In St John and Bonaire, coral cover was stable
   but different between studies, with the ratio of the density of
   juveniles to density of recruits (J:R) 0.10; in Moorea, declines in
   coral cover were followed by recovery that was related to the density of
   juvenile corals 3 years before, with J:R 0.40; and in Okinawa, a decline
   in coral cover in 1998 was followed by a slow recovery with J/R 0.01.
   Coral cover was associated positively with juvenile corals in St John,
   and in Okinawa, the density of juvenile corals was associated positively
   with recruits the year before. J:R varied among studies, and
   standardised densities of juvenile corals declined in the Caribbean, but
   increased in the Pacific. These results suggest that differences in the
   post-settlement success may drive variation in coral community
   structure.

AB Relatively few species of zoonotic parasites have been recorded in
   humans in Papua New Guinea. A greater number of potentially zoonotic
   species, mostly nematodes, occur in animals but are yet to be reported
   from humans. Protozoa is the best represented group of those infecting
   man, with Giardia duodenalis, Cryptosporidium parvum, Cyclospora
   cayetanesis, Toxoplasma gondii, Sarcocystis spp., Entamoeba polecki,
   Balantidium coli and, possibly, Blastocystis hominis. The only zoonotic
   helminths infecting humans include the trematode Paragonimus westermani,
   the cestodes Hymenolepis nana, H. diminuta and the sparganum larva of
   Spirometra erinacea, and the nematodes Trichinella papuae and
   Angiostrongylus cantonensis and, possibly, Ascaris suum. Other groups
   represented are Acanthocephala (Macracanthorhynchus hirudinaceus)),
   insects (Chrysomya bezziana, Cimex sp., Ctenocephalides spp.), and mites
   (Leptotrombidium spp. and, possibly Sarcoptes scabiei, and Demodex sp.).
   One leech (Phytobdella lineata) may also be considered as being
   zoonotic. The paucity of zoonotic parasite species can be attributed to
   long historical isolation of the island of New Guinea and its people,
   and the absence until recent times of large placental mammals other than
   pig and dog. Some zoonotic helminths have entered the country with
   recent importation of domestic animals, in spite of quarantine
   regulations, and a few more (two cestodes, one nematode and one tick)
   are poised to enter from neighbouring countries, given the opportunity.
   Improvement in water supplies, human hygiene and sanitation would reduce
   the prevalence of many of these parasites, and thorough cooking of meat
   would lessen the risk of infection by some others.

AB Fish surveys form the backbone of reef monitoring and management
   initiatives throughout the tropics, and understanding patterns in biases
   between techniques is crucial if outputs are to address key objectives
   optimally. Often biases are not consistent across natural environmental
   gradients such as depth, leading to uncertainty in interpretation of
   results. Recently there has been much interest in mesophotic reefs
   (reefs from 30-150 m depth) as refuge habitats from fishing pressure,
   leading to many comparisons of reef fish communities over depth
   gradients. Here we compare fish communities using stereo-video footage
   recorded via baited remote underwater video (BRUV) and diver-operated
   video (DOV) systems on shallow and mesophotic reefs in the Mesoamerican
   Barrier Reef, Caribbean. We show inconsistent responses across families,
   species and trophic groups between methods across the depth gradient.
   Fish species and family richness were higher using BRUV at both depth
   ranges, suggesting that BRUV is more appropriate for recording all
   components of the fish community. Fish length distributions were not
   different between methods on shallow reefs, yet BRUV recorded more small
   fish on mesophotic reefs. However, DOV consistently recorded greater
   relative fish community biomass of herbivores, suggesting that studies
   focusing on herbivores should consider using DOV. Our results highlight
   the importance of considering what component of reef fish community
   researchers and managers are most interested in surveying when deciding
   which survey technique to use across natural gradients such as depth.

AB A large gold mine has been operating at the Lihir Island Group, Papua
   New Guinea since 1997. The mine disposes of waste rock in nearshore
   waters, impacting nearby coral communities. During 2010, 2012 we
   conducted photographic surveys at 73 sites within 40 km of the mine to
   document impacts of mining operations on the hard coral communities.
   Coral communities close to the mine (similar to 2 km to the north and
   south of the mine) were depaurperate, but surprisingly, coral cover and
   community composition beyond this range appeared to be relatively
   similar, suggesting that the mine impacts were limited spatially. In
   particular, we found mining operations have resulted in a significant
   decrease in coral cover (4.4% 1.48 km from the disposal site c.f. 66.9%
   10.36 km from the disposal site), decreased species richness and a
   predominance of less complex growth forms within similar to 2 km to the
   north and south of the mine waste disposal site. In contrast to the two
   'snapshot' surveys of corals performed in 2010 and 2012, long term data
   (1999-2012) based on visual estimates of coral cover suggested that
   impacts on coral communities may have been more extensive than this.
   With global pressures on the world's coral reefs increasing, it is vital
   that local, direct anthropogenic pressures are reduced, in order to help
   offset the impacts of climate change, disease and predation. Crown

AB Macrofaunal colonization was studied using coral plates fixed at 10m
   depth on a fringing reef in Barbados, West Indies. Two sites were
   compared: Spring Garden, a site that is affected by eutrophication, and
   Six Men's Bay which is relatively free of this effect. Two sets of
   plates were immersed in winter and spring 1990 at each site and
   monitored for 28 and 19 weeks, respectively. Green and brown algae
   colonized first, followed 2 weeks later by ostracods, cumaceans,
   amphipods and polychaetes: terebellids, nereidids and syllids. Most
   colonizers either nestled or encrusted. A total of 11017 invertebrates
   belonging to 145 species were collected. Polychaetes were the most
   abundant and diverse zoological group. Considering polychaetes,
   crustaceans and molluscs, the study sites shared around 75% of the
   species. Overall, densities were higher on lower (shaded) surfaces while
   diversities were higher on upper (illuminated) sides. Similarity
   coefficients and correspondence analysis showed different macrobenthic
   assemblages and colonization patterns in light and shaded and in
   polluted and unpolluted sites. Coral plates were associated according to
   their immersion time' and were closely linked to their stage of
   development. Spring Garden (polluted) presented a higher number of
   soft-bottom and deposit-feeder species (e.g., Capitella capitata).

AB Although coral reefs are widely viewed as oases in an oceanic desert, we
   demonstrate that the oceans around coral reefs in Palau are not deserts
   devoid of food, nor are coral reefs oases isolated from the surrounding
   sea. On flood tides, oceanic zooplankton ddvects onto the Palau barrier
   reef, where it is consumed by a wall Of pldnktivorous fish. Similarly,
   on ebb tides lagoon zooplankton is consumed as it advects across the
   reef flat. Coral reef planktivores ingest zooplankton imported from both
   the sea and the lagoon, but coral reef fish also export meroplanktonic
   fish eggs that disperse offshore. Every day about 30 species of reef
   fishes, some forming spawning aggregations (parrotfish and surgeonfish),
   spawn at the forereef when the tide turns, releasing clouds of buoyant
   eggs and sperm into the ebb-tide waters that flow off the reef flat.
   Fish eggs disperse seaward, but remain entrained within several
   kilometers of the reef in a tidal, neritic water mass, separated from
   oceanic currents by tidal fronts. Flood tides return fish embryos and
   offshore zooplankton to the reef. The flux of materials between oceanic,
   neritic, and lagoon waters near coral reefs must be reexamined.

AB The distribution of dissolved inorganic nutrients (nitrate + nitrite,
   phosphate, and silicate) and plankton (chlorophyll a and zooplankton
   biomass) was investigated in the Bocas del Toro Archipelago, western
   Caribbean coast of Panama. The archipelago is naturally divided in two
   large semi-enclosed lagoons: the Chiriqui Lagoon which is a turbid
   environment under high influence from runoff, and Almirante Bay that is
   less affected by runoff. Three surveys were carried out covering both
   wet and dry months. Hydrological measures varied spatially between
   regions and temporally on a seasonal basis. High concentrations of
   nutrients, chlorophyll a, and zooplankton biomass coincided with heavy
   rainfalls. Significant inverse correlations between dissolved inorganic
   nutrients and salinity during the rainy months confirmed the nutrient
   contribution from runoff. When compared to the ocean exposed
   environments high concentrations of chlorophyll and zooplankton biomass
   were observed in the semi-enclosed lagoons. The episodes of natural
   eutrophication due to high levels of fresh water runoff in the Bocas del
   Toro Archipelago contrast to the nutrient and plankton poor waters in
   coral reef environments along the eastern Caribbean coast of the Isthmus
   of Panama.

AB 1. Consistently very high regional diversity of tropical marine sponges
   reflects a combination of high within-habitat diversity and distinctness
   of species composition among habitats. Distinctive sponge faunas of
   Caribbean coral reefs and mangroves seem to support the assumption that
   abiotic factors determine sponge diversity within habitats and faunal
   differences between habitats because these habitats differ greatly in
   abiotic characteristics and because lower species diversity on mangroves
   appears to reflect their inferiority as sponge habitat.
   2. A way to test this assumption is provided by unusual mangrove cays in
   Belize that are inhabited by the typical Caribbean reef sponge fauna.
   Reciprocal transplant experiments, combined with caging (predator-free
   space) and artificial substrata (competitor-free space), demonstrated
   control of community membership by biological interactions for 12 common
   species: spongivorous predators excluded typical mangrove sponges from
   reef sponge assemblages, and reef sponges were excluded from mangrove
   sponge assemblages by competition.
   3. Variation in growth rate was related inversely to variation in
   defences against predators in the species studied, suggesting a
   trade-off between resistance to competitors and to predators.
   4. This trade-off influences community structure, as the key importance
   of competition for space among mangrove species results in lower
   within-habitat diversity, while multiple challenges, including
   predation, may maintain high diversity of reef sponges. Differences in
   species composition between habitats are maintained, as this trade-off
   precludes success of individual species as members of both faunas.
   5. Most surprising is that typical faunas of mangroves and reefs are not
   tied to these habitats by abiotic factors. Greater sponge species
   diversity on the reef does not necessarily indicate superior conditions
   for sponges. Instead reefs may be a refuge for species that grow too
   slowly to coexist with typical mangrove species.

AB Invasive species can have significant direct and indirect impacts on
   native biota. Here, we conducted a survey of two invasive freshwater
   snail species (Melanoides tuberculata and Tarebia granifera) in Tobago
   and assessed the effects on shell use by native marine hermit crab
   populations (Clibanarius tricolor and C. vittatus). Abundant in
   freshwater, numbers of empty shells at the mouth of a river in
   Charlotteville (Northeast Tobago) increased from 75 to 800 m(-2) after
   heavy rains in the wet-season of June 2012. Subsequent sampling of a
   nearby rocky shore revealed that the freshwater shells were occupied by
   70.2% of hermit crabs. Mimicking a flood event, the experimental
   planting of marked alien freshwater shells showed that 20.3% of hermit
   crabs exchanged their marine shell for a freshwater shell. Similarly, a
   laboratory shell-choice experiment showed that C. tricolor hermit crabs
   changed shells repeatedly, and that 22.2% occupied a freshwater shell
   rather than a marine shell. Overall, due to the numeric abundance of
   freshwater shells and the compulsive shell changing behaviour of
   Clibanarius spp., the ongoing invasion of freshwater gastropods in the
   Caribbean may change the shell use patterns and population dynamics of
   the native hermit crabs.

AB Social and cultural institutions influence how societies organize
   themselves to extract,resources, affecting the ways in which resources
   are used and ultimately managed. In Papua New Guinea, marine tenure
   rights largely determine bow individuals and communities use inshore
   marine resources. Whether institutions of customary marine tenure can
   play a role in resource conservation or are simply mechanisms to avoid
   conflict and maximize exploitation is a matter of debate. In the Manus
   Province, an unusual marine tenure and trade arrangement has resulted in
   the community of Andra producing the majority of lime powder used for
   consumption with betel nut. A socioeconomic and ecological assessment
   revealed that more than 90% of Andra's community was engaged in lime
   production, an industry contributing an estimated US$102,000 +/- 28,000
   to the village annually. The main source of material used in lime
   production at Andra is live branching coral (primarily Acropora spp.).
   The annual removal of approximately 2,113 +/- 660 m(3) of coral appears
   to have produced significant changes in coral cover in Andra's reefs,
   resulting in a lower percent cover of bard corals (24 +/- 2% SE)
   compared with neighboring reefs with little harvesting (33 +/- 3% SE).
   Existing common-property regimes may provide incentives for individuals
   to sustainably use their own reef area. A lapse in supply, however,
   could threaten the community's virtual monopoly and provide other
   villages with an opportunity to gain a market share of lime production.
   Thus, the marine tenure and trade arrangements that facilitated Andra's
   position as the dominant supplier of lime to the province may result in
   incentives for the overexploitation of coral in ways that are
   paradoxical to an open-access scenario. Management interventions that
   aim to reduce the ecological impacts of coral harvesting should reflect
   the community's economic dependence on the practice and the
   sociocultural institutions that influence resource use.

   scales validated and used in the countries in Latin America and the
   Caribbean, and analyze the methods used in validation studies. A search
   was conducted in the Lilacs, SciELO and Medline electronic databases.
   The publications were pre-selected by titles and abstracts, and
   subsequently by a full reading. Of the 16,325 studies reviewed, 14 were
   selected. Twelve validated scales were identified for the following
   countries: Venezuela, Brazil, Colombia, Bolivia, Ecuador, Costa Rica,
   Mexico, Haiti, the Dominican Republic, Argentina and Guatemala. Besides
   these, there is the Latin American and Caribbean scale, the scope of
   which is regional. The scales ranged from the standard reference used,
   number of questions and diagnosis of insecurity. The methods used by the
   studies for internal validation were calculation of Cronbach's alpha and
   the Rasch model; for external validation the authors calculated
   association and / or correlation with socioeconomic and food consumption
   variables. The successful experience of Latin America and the Caribbean
   in the development of national and regional scales can be an example for
   other countries that do not have this important indicator capable of
   measuring the phenomenon of food insecurity.

AB In the early 1980s, women in the South Pacific region called for
   culturally sensitive, attractive nutrition teaching aids. A set of 13
   nutrition education books was produced dealing with food and diseases,
   food preservation, fitness, gardening, budgeting, developing training
   materials, and individual food needs of family members. A decision was
   made to expand the writing group to health educators, home economics
   teachers, agriculture workers and community workers.  Over 70 Pacific
   Islanders from 19 countries were involved in writing, illustrating and
   field testing of the books. Nutrition books are used for English classes
   at the Tarawa Technical Institute, Kiribati. In the Cook Islands, home
   economics teachers are using some of the books in their classrooms. The
   South Pacific Commission Regional Community Education Training Center
   revised their food, nutrition, and community development curriculum
   using the nutrition books as a basic text. In Vanuatu, the books were
   the basis for a reference book for nonformal education centers, and the
   Red Cross in Fiji has reproduced materials from the books on cancer and
   other diseases for health and first aid community education. Major
   funding came from the Canadian International Development Agency, and
   technical and administrative assistance was obtained from the University
   of the South Pacific, South Pacific Commission (SPC), Simon Fraser
   University, and UNICEF. Local governments allowed their staff to assist
   with writing, field testing, and distribution of materials. Some
   participants assisted in producing the materials in local languages. An
   outcome from the project was the formation of a Pacific Island
   Nutritionist and Dietitians Association. The University of the South
   Pacific appointed a Nutrition Coordinator to continue the networking
   among the participants who will also develop a course with the materials
   for certificate level training in the Pacific Island countries.

AB The Caribbean Island Biodiversity Hotspot is composed primarily of the

   spp., ca. 9% of the species endemic to the Antilles) are restricted to
   this hotspot. Most of these genera are unispecific (51%), a pattern that
   is also found on other islands of the world. The majority of the endemic
   genera belong to the "Core Eudicot" clade, and they were published in
   two time periods (1854-1878 and 1904-1928). There are molecular
   phylogenies available for 63 of the endemic genera. However,
   phylogenetic reconstructions of only 21 genera are based on more than
   one independent DNA region and have well-supported clades and good
   taxonomic sampling. Six of the endemic genera form part of
   early-branching groups. We could not infer biogeographical conclusions
   from the molecular phylogenies of most of the endemic genera (43: 68%).
   There is an urgent need for (1) additional field studies to learn the
   conservation status of these genera, (2) effective protection of the
   habitats where the most endangered genera occur, and (3) additional
   biological and systematic studies of the least understood genera.

AB Many tropical reef fishes are divided into Atlantic and East Pacific
   taxa, placing similar species in two very different biogeographic
   regimes. The tropical Atlantic is a closed ocean basin with relatively
   stable currents, whereas the East Pacific is an open basin with unstable
   oceanic circulation. To assess how evolutionary processes are influenced
   by these differences in oceanography and geography, we analyze a 630-bp
   region of mitochondrial cytochrome b from 171 individuals in the
   blenniid genus Ophioblennius. Our results demonstrate deep genetic
   structuring in the Atlantic species, O. atlanticus, corresponding to
   recognized biogeographic provinces, with divergences of d = 5.2-12.7%
   among the Caribbean, Brazilian, St. Helena/Ascension Island, Gulf of
   Guinea, and Azores/Cape Verde regions. The Atlantic phylogeny is
   consistent with Pliocene dispersal from the western to eastern Atlantic,
   and the depth of these separations (along with prior morphological
   comparisons) may indicate previously unrecognized species. The eastern
   Pacific species, O. steindachneri. is characterized by markedly less
   structure than O. atlanticus, with shallow mitochondrial DNA lineages
   (d(max) = 2.7%) and haplotype frequency shifts between locations in the
   Sea of Cortez, Pacific Panama, Clipperton Island, and the: Galapagos
   Islands. No concordance between generic structure and biogeographic
   provinces was found for O. steindachneri. We attribute the
   phylogeographic pattern in O. atlanticus to dispersal during the
   reorganization of Atlantic circulation patterns that accompanied the
   shoaling of the Isthmus of Panama. The low degree of structure in the
   eastern Pacific is probably due to unstable circulation and linkage to
   the larger Pacific Ocean basin. The contrast in genetic signatures
   between Atlantic and eastern Pacific blennies demonstrates how
   differences in geology and oceanography have influenced evolutionary
   radiations within each region.

   at Lautoka sugar factory in Fiji as part of new power generating plant
   to allow an increase in cane crushing and supply of power to the Fiji
   Electricity Authority. The FEA operates a hydroelectric station, but
   during the dry season the water level behind the dam falls so low that
   power generation is not possible, so that the arrangement with the sugar
   factory is of importance. A similar but smaller steam turbine is being
   installed in the nearby Labasa sugar factory.

AB The relative importance of chemical, nematocyst, and nutritional
   defenses was examined for 18 species of Caribbean sea anemones
   (actinarians), zoanthids, and mushroom polyps (corallimorpharians) from
   the Florida Keys and the Bahamas Islands, 2008-2010. Feeding assays were
   performed using the fish Thalassoma bifasciatum with artificial foods
   containing crude organic extracts of cnidarian tissues. A novel
   behavioral assay using brine shrimp nauplii was used to assess
   nematocyst defenses. The nutritional quality of cnidarian tissues was
   examined using bomb calorimetry and soluble protein assays. In general,
   actinarians invested in nematocyst defenses, zoanthids in either
   nematocyst or chemical defenses, and corallimorpharians lacked both,
   except for 1 of 3 species that was chemically defended. Relative to
   other coral reef invertebrates, cnidarian tissues had similar caloric
   values but lower soluble protein concentrations. Trade-offs between
   chemical and nematocyst defenses were observed for 65% of species, while
   habitat and behavior provided a likely explanation for undefended
   species.

AB Premise of research. After Cuba, the three largest islands of the
   Greater Antilles are Hispaniola, Jamaica (JAM), and Puerto Rico (PR),
   all of which are inhabited by the Zamia pumila complex, a monophyletic
   group of dioecious gymnosperms treated as a single polymorphic or as
   many as nine species. We sought to test the following hypotheses for
   Zamia: (i) Dominican Republic (DR) and JAM fit evolutionary models of
   panmixis and isolation, respectively; (ii) historical gene flow has
   occurred between PR and DR, and admixture has occurred between the
   Caymans (CAY) and JAM; and (iii) vegetative morphological characters in
   common with populations on different islands do not conform to genetic
   relationships.
   Methodology. We genotyped a total of 30 populations from CAY, DR, JAM,
   and PR with 21-28 microsatellite (simple sequence repeat [SSR]) loci and
   haplotypes from 10 single-copy nuclear genes (SCNGs) and analyzed the
   data with permuted analysis of molecular variance, Bayesian clustering,
   approximate Bayesian computation coalescent modeling, and network and
   gene flow analyses. By using two different sets of molecular markers
   with very different mutation rates (SSRs and SCNGs), we sought to
   capture two distinct time slices of evolutionary history in the
   populations of each island.
   Pivotal results. Diversification of Caribbean Zamia follows a different
   path on each island after migration or vicariance from ancestors
   putatively originating in Cuba. DR and PR evolved from a common
   ancestral gene pool. DR fits a model of panmixis, while PR fits a
   vicariance model of semispeciation. Northern and western populations in
   JAM represent separate introductions to the island. Overall, JAM shows
   minimal levels of gene flow among populations and apparent admixture
   with CAY.
   Conclusions. We conclude that niche adaptation and associated vegetative
   morphological character states evolve convergently among different
   islands in response to environmental and other stochastic variables. We
   present a model of how these dioecious gymnosperms diversified in the
   Greater Antilles.

   are identified and discussed, and new taxonomic information is provided

   diverse localities including Pacific Mexico (Lepidopa californica and L.
   deamae), Atlantic Panama (Albunea paretii and A. catherinae), Madagascar
   (Albunea groeningi and A. symmysta, although the locality data on these
   species needs verification), India (A. symmysta), Reunion Island (A.
   holthuisi), the Philippines (A. microps), Guam (A. speciosa and
   Paralbunea dayriti), Moorea (A. elioti) and Hawaii (Albunea bulla). The
   sole specimen of Albunea bulla from Hawaii represents only the third
   species of albuneid recorded from the island chain. An overlooked
   misidentification of specimens of "Albunea thurstoni" from Hawaii (=
   Albunea danai) is also included. The discovery of a population of A.
   catherinae in Atlantic Panama is surprising and shows a highly disjunct
   distribution for the species, which could be the result of ballast water
   discharge near the Panama Canal Zone. Several specimens studied exhibit
   morphological characters that differ from typical members of their
   species and this illustrates the challenges of defining species
   boundaries from relatively small sample sizes. Discovery of a long
   overlooked species description reveals that Albunea scutelloides
   Garstang, 1897 is the senior synonym of Albunea mariellae Serene, 1973
   and is the valid name for the type species of the genus Squillalbunea

AB Several researches have been carried out on Jardines de la Reina
   archipelago, south of Cuba, from 1997 to 2007, in order to study
   biodiversity. Among conspicuos fauna, fishes have been targeted by
   research and their first inventory on this group of islands has been
   prepared. The species identification was mainly in situ using SCUBA and
   snorkeling techniques. The inventory includes 251 species. The best
   represented families of fishes are Serranidae, Carangidae, Haemulidae,
   Labridae and Scaridae. High abundance of large size top predators
   specimens of Serranidae, Lutjanidae, Sphyraenidae, Carangidae and sharks
   are often seen on Jardines de la Reins. In Jardines de la Reins occurs
   24% of the Cuban ichthyofauna, 25% of the strictly marine fish, 18% of
   the Chondrichthyes and 26% of the Actinopterygii. Diversity of taxa is
   higher in Jardines de is Reina than that in northwestern and
   northeastern regions of Cuba, while the most diverse families are
   generally the same among regions although they rank different among
   them.

AB Descriptions of precolonial foodways in the Caribbean Islands have
   relied primarily on contact-period European descriptions, which have
   been used to inform archaeological research. The use of ethnohistoric
   and indirect archaeological evidence is debated, and competing
   reconstructions of potential botanical foods and their cooking processes
   have resulted. To address this issue, starch analysis, which is suitable
   to provide information on human-plant interactions in tropical regions
   with poor botanical preservation, was carried out on samples from shell
   and limestone potential plant-processing tools from the Rolling Heads
   site, Long Island, The Bahamas. Results of this study revealed that some
   of these shell and lithic tools were used to process several different
   starchy food sources: maize (Zea mays L.), manioc (Manihot esculenta
   Crantz), and coontie (Zamia spp.). The presence of more than one plant
   species on both the microlith and shell tools, demonstrates their
   multi-purpose use. These novel data have also generated interpretations
   of plant processing with limestone grater chips. Overall, our research
   provides integral data regarding regional-specific processing of manioc,
   maize, and coontie. This report provides new information regarding
   human-plant interactions in the Caribbean. Finally, this study provides
   data on the use of shell tools and lithic graters for processing plants
   it contributes to ongoing discussions of reconstructing ancient Bahamian
   and related Caribbean foodways.

AB Childhood under-nutrition and malnutrition are prevalent in low and
   middle-income countries. Where agriculture is the primary source of food
   production, consumption, and cash income, it has a close relationship
   with health and nutrition in these emerging economies. Although
   Timor-Leste achieved lower middle-income status in 2011, national
   economic growth has not delivered anticipated nutritional dividends.
   Seeking to redress a lack of research that clearly demonstrates how
   agriculture impacts on nutrition in Timor-Leste, we investigated the
   links between household agricultural activities and children's physical
   growth in two agro-ecologically varying field sites: lowland Natarbora
   and mountainous Ossu. Children in both sites were below World Health
   Organization standards in height, weight, and body mass index. Coastal
   children recorded better growth than upland children. Livestock
   production was linked to poorer growth in the upland, but not coastal
   communities, which may be linked to specific differences in husbandry
   practices. In both communities, access to a plantation was somewhat
   associated with children's (0-10years) increased weight-for-age. As
   simple agricultural indicators do not fully explain growth outcomes, a
   livelihood security approach is proposed to better understand how
   households address food and nutritional needs in relation to broader
   livelihood concerns.

AB We describe a modified (GARSIDE, 1982. Marine Chemistry, 11, 159-167)
   nitrite method that permits measurements down to subnanomolar
   concentrations and present data from Atlantic and Caribbean deepwater
   profiles for comparison with a published Pacific section.
   This important intermediate in the nitrogen cycle was detected in all
   samples. Concentrations were consistently lowest (0.1-0.4 nM) in
   oligotrophic surface waters. Below 1 km. Caribbean and Southwest
   Sargasso sea nitrite concentrations were 0.4-1 nM, decreasing with
   increasing depth; reported Pacific [NO2-] averages are several times
   higher. Profiles in the upper kilometer beneath the classical primary
   nitrite maximum (PNM) were qualitatively similar, exhibiting a smooth
   supra-exponential drop with depth to values of approximately 1-4 nM at 1
   km.
   The nitrite inventory in this "tail" of the PNM above 1 km with 1 nM
   less-than-or-equal-to [NO2-] less-than-or-equal-to 50 nM roughly equals
   that in the classical PNM. Significant differences among profiles in the
   0.1-1 km region are observed, consistent with nitrite pool turnover
   times of 3-7 days estimated from Redfield stoichiometry and
   tritium-helium ages. Thus seasonal and/or regional variations in factors
   altering the nitrite production-consumption balance, rather than
   transport, seem to be responsible for nitrite variability.
   Nitrite profiles with anomalous midwater or near-bottom fine structure,
   including multi-point maxima and minima, were found along the Venezuelan
   continental margin and at approximately 13-degrees-N. These features are
   tentatively ascribed to boundary effects, as hydrographic and
   circumstantial evidence suggests that these waters interacted previously
   with the bottom.

AB As a response to growing land and freshwater shortages and climate
   change, the use of seaweeds as food, their cultivation at sea and its
   effect on biodiversity are being researched on both the Caribbean and
   Pacific coasts of Costa Rica. Native species, more plentiful on the
   Caribbean coast, were collected and pre-selected based on existing
   information and on criteria including ubiquity, abundance, growth and
   palatability. These species were then evaluated as food and subjected to
   floating long-line cultivation using vegetative propagules. After
   establishing postharvest procedures, use as food involved many
   preparations to be eaten fresh or after drying, including a dry-ground
   meal. Ten of these species, which had nutrient contents within expected
   values including 9.8% crude protein on a dry weight (dw) basis and high
   iron, were considered adequate as food, both directly and as part of
   recipes in quantities not exceeding 20% dw of a given dish. Higher
   concentrations either 'overwhelmed' traditional recipes or their taste
   was rejected by tested consumers. Near-coast cultivation was in general
   a simple matter, easily transferred to artisanal fishers. To a great
   extent due to herbivory and theft of ropes, yield (ranging from 51.7 to
   153.2 t ha(-1) yr(-1) on a fresh weight basis) was quantified for only
   five species with a mean of 9.3 t ha(-1) yr(-1) dw, equivalent to 0.91 t
   ha(-1) yr(-1) of crude protein-very similar to yields of two grain crops
   per year. Species of Codium, Gracilaria, Sargassum and Ulva were
   considered adequate both for use as food and cultivation. Cultivated
   seaweed plots rapidly attracted biodiversity, including a significantly
   larger number of fish species and individuals than nearby control areas.
   Based on this we postulate the need to further explore a 'biodiversity
   enrichment' service from seaweed cultivation and any effect of this on
   fisheries enhancement. While noting areas in which further research and
   international collaboration are needed, it is concluded that tropical
   seaweeds, besides their many other uses, can at this stage substitute up
   to 15% of food on a dry weight basis, their cultivation is simple, and
   effects on biodiversity are a previously undocumented advantage. Given
   the lack of experience in most of the world excepting some Asian
   countries, the agriculture-like approach followed here may be of use to
   others in tropical developing countries who wish to explore seaweed
   cultivation at sea, for food and other products and for
   environmental/biodiversity services. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights

AB A commonly held belief is that if people can benefit financially from
   enterprises that depend on nearby forests, reefs, and other natural
   habitats, then they will take action to conserve and sustainably use
   them. The Biodiversity Conservation Network brought together
   conservation and development organizations and local communities to
   systematically test this hypothesis across 39 conservation project sites
   in Asia and the Pac ftc. Each project implemented one or more
   community-based enterprises such as setting up an ecotourism lodge,
   distilling essential oils from wild plant roots, producing jams and
   jellies from forest fruits, harvesting timber, or collecting marine
   samples to test for pharmaceutical compounds. Each project team
   collected the biological, enterprise, and social data necessary to test
   the network's hypothesis. We present the results of this test. We found
   that a community-based enterprise strategy can lead to conservation, but
   only under limited conditions and never on its own. We summarize the
   specific conditions under which an enterprise strategy will and will not
   work in a decision chart that can be used by project managers to
   determine whether this strategy might make sense at their site. We also
   found that an enterprise strategy can be subsidized and still create a
   net gain that pays for conservation. Based on our experiences, we
   recommend developing "learning portfolios" that combine action and
   research to test other conservation strategies.

AB Sphoeroides testudineus (Linnaeus, 1758), is a common, widely
   distributed fish in coastal ecosystems. To better understand the trophic
   niche of S. testudineus, we collected individuals from tidal creeks on
   Abaco Island, The Bahamas, and employed stomach content and stable
   isotope analysis. Examination of stomach contents showed that mollusks,
   such as West Indian false cerith snails, cerith snails, and tellin
   clams, were the most common prey items. Diet data were consistent with
   stable isotopes data such that S. testudineus seem to feed at an
   intermediate trophic position in the food web. These preliminary data
   suggest that S. testudineus may be a critical intermediate link in these
   wetland food webs, serving as pathways through which energy is
   transferred from primary consumers to other predator species.

AB Coastal communities within small island developing states are typically
   highly dependent on fisheries and other natural resource-based
   livelihoods. However, specialisation as a 'fisher' is rare compared to
   diverse livelihoods that can be adapted as opportunities and challenges
   emerge. Understanding this dynamic "livelihood landscape" is important
   for improving governance and livelihood opportunities associated with
   natural resources. Using data from 495 households across 15 communities
   on Atauro Island, Timor-Leste, this study evaluates the importance of
   fisheries within a suite of livelihoods; the correlation of livelihoods
   structure with wellbeing; and the spatial and temporal variation of
   those livelihoods. Activities linked to primary production were
   nominated by 67% of households as their primary livelihood, 41% fished,
   and of those 54% considered fishing their primary livelihood. Almost all
   households (95%) owned livestock, and even respondents who considered
   themselves 'fishers' ranked livestock disease, rather than fisheries
   related concerns, as their most critical livelihood challenge.
   Engagement in fishing varied by location and time of year. Communities
   in more protected locales fished throughout the year, and had less
   diverse livelihoods. This study highlights that interventions focused on
   self-identified 'fishers' would only engage a fraction of the population
   that derive benefit from fisheries resources, would likely overlook the
   most prevalent challenges fishers face, and would focus on those with
   relatively high food security and income. Measures of wellbeing were
   better explained by geography and sociocultural settings, rather than
   dominant income sources. The results emphasise the value of cross-sector
   development interventions informed by contextualised analysis of
   livelihoods and wellbeing outcomes.

AB Arguments in support of the Pacific origin for the Caribbean Plate are
   discussed along with others that point to an inter-American origin.
   Entry of a Pacific-derived plate would have involved unlikely,
   geometrically complex and highly diachronous events. They would have
   included changes in direction of subduction, changes in direction of
   plate migration, major (1000s of km) plate migration, major rotation of
   large parts of a volcanic arc, major rotations of the Maya and Chortis
   blocks and diachronous development of flysch/wildflysch deposits as the
   entering plate interacted with neighbouring elements. The internal
   structural conformity of the Caribbean Plate and of the Maya and Chortis
   blocks with regional geology of Middle America shows that no major
   migrations or rotations have occurred. Coeval, regional deposits of
   Albian shallow water limestones, Paleocene- Middle Eocene
   flysch/wildflysch deposits, Middle Eocene limestones, and a regional
   Late Eocene hiatus show an inter-American location, not a changing
   Pacific-Caribbean location. Neogene displacement of the Caribbean
   relative to North and South America amounts to no more than 300 km.

AB The genus Cyrtandra is the largest in the Gesneriaceae family and is one
   of the most widely dispersed plant genera in southeast Asia and the
   Pacific. Species of Cyrtandra are morphologically diverse but characters
   are often homoplastic causing considerable difficulty in defining
   monophyletic classification units. In this study, we used molecular
   phylogenetic analysis of 88 taxa representing approximately 70 species
   to construct a well-resolved evolutionary hypothesis for Cyrtandra.
   Diversification rates analysis and ancestral range analysis were also
   conducted to infer timing of major lineage divergences and geographic
   origin of these lineages, principally among Pacific species. Using these
   data, we compared existing classification schemes to better understand
   the applicability of current taxonomy. Divergence time estimates support
   a diversification of the Pacific clade at approximately 20 MYBP.
   Although the origin of the Pacific lineage remains unresolved, ancestral
   range reconstruction analysis supports Fiji as the most likely
   "first-step" into the Pacific with subsequent dispersals to Hawai'i, and
   other archipelagos. A greater Fiji-Samoa region, corresponding with
   Takhtajan's Fijian Region, is implicated as a major Pacific region
   interface and possibly a center of origin for expansion of Cyrtandra
   throughout the Pacific. Among South Pacific taxa sampled, several
   supported clades in our evolutionary hypothesis are characterized by
   distinct morphological traits possibly warranting sectional rankings.
   Relationships among Hawaiian taxa are less resolved and the
   distributions of species within this clade do not consistently
   correspond to existing sectional rankings. More detailed,
   population-level research is needed to clarify these relationships. We
   argue that future sectional classifications should correspond with
   monophyletic lineages and that species-level relationships should be
   more closely studied within these lineages. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc. All

AB Very small islands, on the order of a few hundred square metres in area,
   have rarely been the focus of ecological investigations. I sampled nine
   such islands in the central Exumas, Bahamas for arthropod species
   abundance and diversity using a combination of pitfall traps, pan traps
   and sticky traps. Three islands had no terrestrial vegetation, three
   islands contained only Sesuvium portulacastrum L., a salt-tolerant
   perennial that had been experimentally introduced 10 years ago, and
   three islands supported one or two naturally Occurring plant species. A
   relatively diverse arthropod assemblage was discovered, including
   representatives of 10 different orders of Crustacea and Insecta. Land
   hermit crabs were the most abundant crustaceans, and dipterans were the
   most abundant and speciose insects. Two of the most common insects were
   previously undescribed species. Measures of arthropod species abundance
   and diversity were not significantly different for vegetated vs.
   non-vegetated islands. All 10 orders were present on bare islands, and
   nine of them were present on vegetated islands. Measures of arthropod
   species abundance and diversity were positively associated with island
   area, and negatively associated with distance from the nearest large
   island. Hypothesized food webs consist of several trophic levels and
   have strong allochthonous inputs. Tiny islands such as these hold
   insights into early successional processes and the base of insular food
   webs.

AB A new calanoid copepod, Fosshagenia ferrarii, new genus, new species,
   was found in plankton samples collected in an anchialine cave of Caicos
   Islands, Bahamas. A combination of features found in this species
   separates it as the type of a new superfamily. The new taxon can be
   distinguished by a combination of several relevant taxonomic
   characteristics, such as the fusion of antennular segments 8 and 9, the
   right antennule modified in the male, less than 3 endopodal segments on
   the first legs, the presence of a uniramous female fifth leg, a male
   fifth leg forming a complex grasping organ, reduced mouthparts, and the
   presence of only 1 seta on the middle endopodal segment of legs 3 and 4.
   The new taxon appears to be more closely related to fresh- and
   brackish-water forms (Centropagoidea) than to any other hitherto known;
   anchialine copepod group. The type species can be distinguished by the
   presence of lateral processes on the genital double-somite of the female
   and on the first urosomal somite of the male. It is the smallest of the
   known anchialine calanoid species. This small species, a predator in the
   water column, diverges from other anchialine copepods which are
   bottom-dwellers.

AB Prevalence of Toxoplasma gondii infection in pregnant women in Grenada
   is considered high. Little is known of the epidemiology of T. gondii
   infection in Caribbean Islands. Serum samples of 750 food animals in
   Grenada and Carriacou were tested for antibodies to T. gondii by the
   modified agglutination test (MAT). Antibodies to T. gondii (MAT, 1:25 or
   higher) were found in 23.1% of 247 pigs, 44.1% of 204 sheep, 42.8% of
   180 goats, and 8.4% of 119 cattle. Seroprevalence increased with age,
   indicating postnatal acquisition of T. gondii. Antibody titers of 1:200
   or higher were present in 65 of 90 seropositive sheep, 61 of 77
   seropositive goats, and 23 of 57 seropositive pigs. However, none of the
   cattle had a MAT titer of 1:200, suggesting that bovines are a poor host
   for T. gondii. Results indicate that pigs, sheep, and goats could be
   important sources of T. gondii infection if their meat is consumed
   undercooked.

   by 1,720 individuals from 326 woody plant species. Only fruits from 52%
   ( 171) of the plant species sampled were attacked. On average,
   Lepidoptera were reared from 1 in 89 fruits and a kilogram of fruit was
   attacked by 1.01 individuals. Host specificity of Lepidoptera was
   notably low: 69% ( 33) of species attacked plants from > 1 family, 8% (
   4) fed on single family, 6% ( 3) on single genus and 17% ( 8) were
   monophagous. The average kilogram of fruits was infested by 0.81
   individual from generalist species ( defined here as feeding on > 1
   plant genus) and 0.07 individual from specialist species ( feeding on a
   single host or congeneric hosts). Lepidoptera preferred smaller fruits
   with both smaller mesocarp and seeds. Large- seeded fruits with thin
   mesocarp tended to host specialist species whereas those with thick,
   fleshy mesocarp were often infested with both specialist and generalist
   species. The very low incidence of seed damage suggests that
   predispersal seed predation by Lepidoptera does not play a major role in
   regulating plant populations via density- dependent mortality processes
   outlined by the Janzen-Connell hypothesis.

   elucidate the processes leading to enhanced near surface phytoplankton
   biomass within the front. Although chlorophyll content of the water
   column to either side of the front is similar, phytoplankton in waters
   within this "Caribbean-Atlantic front'' resides for the most part above
   the pycnocline and sustains large production rates in comparison with
   the lower rates of deep, sub-pycnocline WTNA phytoplankton. Nitrogen
   budgets indicate that a substantial fraction of the production within
   the front may arise from biological nutrient recycling while the deeper
   WTNA communities rely to a greater extent on nutrients from below the

AB The establishment of the Island Food Community of Pohnpei, a

   of Micronesia, presents a new approach for promoting Pacific Island food
   for its health and many other benefits. Its vision is holistic,
   stressing the importance of island food for sustainable development,
   economic benefits, self-reliance, improved health, cultural
   preservation, and human dignity, at the same time protecting the natural
   resources. A major reason for the establishment of this NGO is the
   emergence of an epidemic of nutrition-related health problems, including
   diabetes, heart disease, cancer, vitamin A deficiency, and anemia.
   Although health is at the cornerstone of the establishment of this NGO
   and health officers are integrally involved, the project is closely
   associated with the agriculture sector. The Island Food Community of
   Pohnpei works via an ethnographic participatory inter-agency approach,
   and its activities include the identification and promotion of
   nutrient-rich varieties of the traditional staple foods, incorporating
   the 'Yellow Varieties Message'. There are also activities to conserve
   rare varieties and to develop small-scale food processing.

   locations across the Atlantic Ocean (39 degrees 66 N, 27 degrees 50 S).
   These locations provide a richness gradient ranging from 54 species in
   St Paul's Rocks to 474 in Cuba. We used cluster analyses to assess how
   historical and biogeographic factors have shaped the taxonomic and
   functional structure (i.e. the distribution of species within families,
   diet and body size groups) of assemblages. We then employed a
   constrained analysis of principal coordinates (CAP) to test the relative
   influence of the distance from the biodiversity centre in the Atlantic,
   sea surface temperature, isolation, coral species richness and area, and
   coastal length on the observed patterns of assemblage structure.
   ResultsThe taxonomic and functional structure of reef fish assemblages
   across the Atlantic exhibits a biogeographic fingerprint, with a marked
   discrimination between species-rich biogenic reefs (concentrated
   primarily in the Caribbean and composed of small species feeding on
   invertebrates) and poorer peripheral regions dominated by larger species
   with more diverse diets. The first CAP axis explains 87% of body size
   distribution in assemblages, showing that the effects of sea surface
   temperature and coral richness and those of isolation are antagonistic
   and can be embedded into a single dimension. Environmental factors, such
   as temperature and habitat complexity, explain the disproportionate
   number of small species in the Caribbean, whereas in the remaining
   regions the predominance of large-bodied fish increases with isolation
   due to high dispersal ability.
   Main conclusionsWe found that historical events, which have shaped the
   biogeography of reef fishes, and environmental characteristics (coral
   reefs versus periphery) have both played a role in structuring the
   taxonomic and functional components of Atlantic fish assemblages.

AB Using optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) analysis we obtained
   depositional ages ranging from 25 10 to 928 144 years before present for
   sediments deposited in oxbow lakes along three lowland river systems.
   The dated sediments were collected from the banks of tie channels along
   the Lower Mississippi River, the Fly River in Papua New Guinea, and
   Birch Creek along the Yukon River in Alaska. Tie channels connect the
   oxbow lakes to the main stem river and allow the exchange of water and
   suspended sediment between the two. The banks consist of fine sand and
   sandy silt beds interlayered with silt and clay. OSL samples were
   collected both horizontally from exposed banks and vertically by coring
   through levee crests; sample collection was targeted at beds containing
   appreciable quantities of fine sand. OSL ages were determined using
   single-grain or in some cases single-aliquot techniques and dose
   distribution analysis. Samples were first collected along the Lower
   Mississippi tie channel to compare OSL dates with historical data
   sources and test the applicability of OSL in these settings; the OSL
   dates agreed closely with historical data. In all three river systems,
   OSL dating allowed the determination of vertical accretion rates, tie
   channel advancement rates, and oxbow lake ages. In Papua New Guinea, OSL
   sampling also provides an estimate of lateral migration rates of the Fly
   River and allows a comparison of modern mine-influenced deposition rates
   with natural background rates over the last 1000 years. Results from
   Papua New Guinea and the Mississippi River suggest that the advancement
   rate of tie channels responds directly to changes in the sediment load
   of the main stem river. Copyright (c) 2005 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB In Papua New Guinea growth is slow and adult body size is small. This is
   often considered an adaptation to the low energy and nutrient densities
   of the diets in which tubers and root crops predominate. Social and
   economic change have been a feature of Papua New Guinea, particularly in
   recent times. In 1969 the human biology of two contrasting communities,
   one coastal with a long interaction with external influences and cash
   cropping, the other a highland community with a history of more recent
   contacts, was investigated. In 1984 repeal measurements of nutritional
   anthropometry were made on the villagers and those born in the previous
   14 years. The coastal boys and girls were taller and heavier in 1984
   compared with 1969 but remained below the 5th percentile of reference
   North American data. Increases were also found in the highland children,
   particularly girls, but significantly lower means were found in children
   under 2 years. Although stunting was less common in the coastal children
   in 1984, 156 cases (37%) versus 175 cases (43%) (chi(2) = 7.69, rho <
   0.05), wasting increased in prevalence from 11 cases (3%) to 20 cases
   (5%) (n.s.), either because of recent food shortages or because height
   change was greater than weight change. Stunting rose by 3% to 53% (165
   cases) in highland children (chi(2) = 7.24, p < 0.05). In adults,
   heights were 2-3 cm greater in 1984 than 1969, and weights 2-3 kg
   greater, with peak differences in the 30-39-year-olds. The percentage of
   coastal women with body mass indices of less than 18.5 kg/m(2) fell from
   32% to 15% (chi(2) = 274, p < 0.01). Mid-upper arm circumferences and
   triceps skinfolds were significantly higher in all groups. National and
   regional data suggest that the communities were better off in 1984 than
   1969, but social and economic changes were associated with variable
   benefits in growth and nutritional status.

AB As we approach the twenty-first century, concepts of "health food" and
   "healthy food" remain paramount in American culture. Yet, what lessons
   have we learned? Transformation of the agro-food sector serves to
   demonstrate that we as consumers and social scientists need to expand
   our understanding of "health food" or "healthy food" to include
   production practices, local knowledge and technology, the political and
   economic milieu in which production and distribution are sustained, as
   well as their impact on humans and the biophysical environment. This
   article examines transformation of the agro-food sector in the Caribbean
   and its connections to the European Union and the United States markets
   from this perspective. In addition, this article examines the
   transformation of longstanding cash crops, such as sugar cane and
   bananas, to other food commodities. Political ecology is used to examine
   the agro-food sector to understand more clearly the relationship among
   food producers, local governments, transnational corporations,
   international policy makers and regional and extra-regional markets
   vis-a-vis the linkages they maintain. Specific attention is given to the
   Windward Islands where the increase in cultivated acreage and the
   associated loss of vegetative cover is furthering a downward spiral of
   environmental degradation. In the past not only has the natural
   environment suffered, local human populations have paid the price
   physically and economically.

AB Epimenia australis (Thiele) is a large, tropical, shallow-water
   neomenioid aplacophoran, or solenogaster, of the west Pacific. More than
   30 individuals were collected during January and February by diving off
   Madang, Papua New Guinea, where they occurred in aggregations with their
   cnidarian prey underneath overturned coral slabs at 15-24 m depth in a
   steeply sloping coral rock area with swift currents. Animals were kept
   alive for several weeks in large aquaria with running sea water and fed
   Scleronephthya. Like other species of Epimeniidae, E. australis is
   brightly coloured, with iridescent green and blue patches on a
   reddish-brown background. Madang specimens were up to 11 cm long and 6
   mm in width and were in reproductive condition with brooding embryos in
   the mantle cavity. Some individuals contained embryos in several stages
   of development. Epimenia fed on Scleronephthya by clamping onto the soft
   coral with the hook-shaped radular teeth while sucking in the polyps.
   They move by ciliary action of the small foot along a mucous strand
   secreted within the pedal groove; the foot remains within the groove.
   When not moving, the body can be held rigidly upright. Epimenia were
   active at night but remained hidden during the day, firmly wrapped
   around each other and the coral rock on which they were found. The
   anterior end, with its vestibule containing bundles of papillae and with
   a dorsal protuberance bordered by sensory cirri, was sensitive to touch,
   and the animals appeared capable of olfaction, able to find their prey
   and reacting to each other. The species is redescribed by spicule,
   radula, and internal morphology. The synonymy of Dinomenia verrucosa
   Nierstrasz is considered.

AB OBJECTIVE: To investigate the association between individual degree of
   modernization and obesity in Papua New Guineans using a score of
   relative 'modernity'.
   DESIGN: Cross-sectional survey in six populations with varying degrees
   of modernity. Independent effects of modernity score, components of
   modernity score, age and physical activity were assessed in relation to
   general obesity (body mass index (BMI)) and body fat distribution
   (waist-hip ratio (WHR)). A sub-study of the relationship between diet
   and modernity was also performed.
   SETTING: Population-based samples of subjects in three Highland and
   three coastal locations in the developing country of Papua New Guinea
   (PNG).
   SUBJECTS: 1877 subjects greater than or equal to 25 years of age
   attended the survey.
   MEASUREMENTS: Age, physical activity, BMI, WHR, 2-h oral glucose
   tolerance test, and modernity score, based on area of origin, father's
   employment, type and duration of individual's employment, education,
   years in an urban centre, housing type and spouse score.
   RESULTS: More modern subjects had higher mean BMI and lower levels of
   physical activity, and mean WHR also varied with modernity in men but
   not women. In linear regression analysis, total modernity score was
   significantly associated with both BMI and WHR in men and women,
   independently of age and physical activity. When components of the
   modernity score were examined, younger age, more sophisticated housing
   and increasing number of years in an urban centre were independently
   associated with BMI in men and women, while education level and reduced
   physical activity were also significant predictors in men. Associations
   with WHR were weaker. Results of the dietary sub-study suggested that
   the lowest energy and nutrient intakes occurred in the least modern men
   and women.
   CONCLUSION: Aspects of modernity, such as more sophisticated housing and
   greater number of years spent in an urban centre, may be markers of
   higher income and increasing adoption of Western ways, which in turn are
   associated with physical inactivity and increased availability of
   energy-dense Western food, thus promoting obesity in this rapidly
   developing Pacific nation.

AB Interviews with 509 adults in New Providence, The Bahamas, indicated
   that people have limited knowledge of dog care and the laws pertaining
   to nonhuman animal welfare. Interviews also indicated that many dogs
   received care limited only to food and water and-to a lesser
   extent-shelter. Potcakes (local mongrels) received the least health
   care; "breed" dogs, the most. Primary caregivers gave the impression
   that dogs were better cared for than did nonprimary caregivers. Although
   some educational messages must distinguish between those who do-and do
   not-live in dog-keeping households, others need not. For example, myths
   associated with neutering are more deeply entrenched in the general
   population than within members of dog-keeping households. However, all
   respondents had an inadequate knowledge of the law relating to dog care.

   Evidence consisted of scratch marks on the boles of trees in conjunction
   with the removal of all moss and direct sightings of animals eating
   bark. Only 43 trees >= 10 cm diameter at breast height (DBH) of 19
   species showed signs of consumption at the study site; five of these
   species were confirmed by direct sighting to be consumed by painted
   ringtails. We sought to determine if bark of these trees contained
   important dietary minerals. Analyses showed that calcium and potassium,
   individually and combined, were significantly more abundant in eaten
   versus uneaten trees of the same species. On average, eaten trees showed
   4.7 and 2.2 times the amount of these minerals, respectively, as found
   in uneaten trees. Adult males were more likely than adult females or
   juvenile males to be captured at eaten trees than away from them. Two
   species of Syzygium and one species of Sloanea were highly selected for
   bark consumption, but not all trees of a species were eaten; rather,
   particular individuals of these species were preferred. We conclude that
   bark appears to be an important source of calcium and potassium, and
   speculate on the relationship between the limited availability of these
   special trees and the social behavior of painted ringtails.

AB New Guinea's mountains provide an important case study for understanding
   early modern human environmental adaptability and early developments
   leading to agriculture. Evidence is presented showing that human
   colonization pre-dated 35ka (ka = thousands of uncalibrated radiocarbon
   years before present) and was accompanied by landscape modification
   using fire. Sorties into the subalpine zone may have occurred before the
   Late Glacial Maximum (LGM), and perhaps contributed to megafaunal
   extinction. Humans persisted in the intermontane valleys through the LGM
   and expanded rapidly into the subalpine on climatic warming, when
   burning and clearance may have retarded vegetation re-colonization.
   Plant food use dates from at least 31ka, confirming that some of New
   Guinea's distinctive agricultural practices date to the earliest
   millennia of human presence.

AB As Vitamin A deficiency (VAD) is a serious problem in the Republic of
   the Marshall Islands (RMI), it is important to identify locally grown,
   acceptable sources of vitamin A. Pandamis fruit, a traditional
   Marshallese staple food, has a yellow-orange colouration suggesting
   substantial carotenoid content. However, few of the many Marshallese
   cultivars were previously analysed for nutrient content. Thus, this
   study was conducted in order to identify carotenoid-rich Marshallese
   pandanus cultivars that could be promoted to alleviate VAD. Ethnography
   was used to select cultivars and assess acceptability. Thirteen
   cultivars were analysed by two laboratories for alpha- and beta-
   carotene and other carotenoids using high-performance liquid
   chromatography. The cultivars contained a range of carotenoid levels
   (21-902 mu g beta-carotene/100 g), with higher levels in cultivars
   having deeper yellow-orange coloured fruit; 10 cultivars had significant
   levels that meet estimated vitamin A requirements within normal
   consumption patterns. There was excellent agreement between the
   laboratories' results. Pandanus has been increasingly neglected in
   recent years, but is still well liked and considered a Marshallese
   health food. The promotion of carotenoid-rich culturally acceptable
   pandanus cultivars could contribute to alleviating vitamin A,
   micronutrient, and chronic disease problems in the RMI and other Pacific
   contexts, particularly atoll islands, where pandanus is an important
   food. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

   Oxyops vitiosa had reduced biomass and fecundity when fed different M.
   quinquenervia chemical variants. To find suitable sites for release of
   this herbivore species and locations where nursery sites can be
   developed for mass production of weevils, we studied the natural
   terpenoid variation in this plant throughout its range in Florida. For
   comparison, we also examined the terpenoid variation in naturalized
   populations in the Caribbean, Hawaii, and Australia. We found that two
   chemical variants or chemotypes exist in Florida, each dominated by one
   sesquiterpene, either E-nerolidol or viridiflorol. In the 28 populations
   studied in Florida no regional trends in chemotype dominance were found.
   More than half (16 of 28) of the populations were composed of between 34
   and 66% of both chemotypes. A similar number of populations were
   dominated (> 66%) by either the E-nerolidol (eight populations) or the
   viridiflorol (six populations) chemotype plants. Additionally, the total
   amount of terpenoids in leaves from plants grown north of the invasive
   range of M. quinquenervia was significantly reduced compared with
   invasive populations. The total amount of terpenoids in leaves from
   plants grown in Australia and the Caribbean was significantly greater
   than those in leaves from Florida and Hawaii. These results identified
   eight populations that would be most suitable for initial releases and
   where field nurseries could be established for on-site mass production.

AB The Maldives host a sophisticated and competitive international tourist
   industry which has replaced fishing as the dominant economic activity.
   With their rich tropical reef ecosystems and the abundant biodiversity
   of their marine environment, a total of 86 uninhabited islands had been
   converted into Resort Islands by the end of 2000. Resort Islands are
   equipped with comprehensive facilities for accommodation, food,
   recreation and leisure. They are also strictly reserved for foreign
   tourists and guarantee complete privacy. This gives the benefit of
   averting conflicts of acculturation with local islanders. In the arena
   of impacts on the physical environment, however, the consumptive leisure
   lifestyle of the tourists has been harmful to the Resort Islands as seen
   in sewage, garbage and waste pollution, as well as reef destruction and
   beach erosion. While the government of the Maldives takes great effort
   to harmonise tourism and the environment, the growth of mass tourism in
   the last 20 years has engendered grave environmental impacts. For future
   sustainable development of the Resort Islands, the tourists'
   environmental awareness must be increased to promote greater
   responsibility for the protection of the fragile coral and reef
   ecosystems of the Maldives.

   brought together contemporary Lihir items related to performance (many
   of which were made especially for the exhibition), an international loan
   of Lihir artefacts from the Field Museum of Natural History in Chicago,
   USA, and multimedia items including film and sound recordings that set
   the audio and visual scene. The aims of the exhibition were multiple: to
   showcase Lihir culture to the outside world, to illustrate the range of
   performance practices in Lihir, and to interrogate the relationship of
   these practices to the Lihir landscape. This article gives the
   curatorial perspective on how this nexus between performance and the
   Lihir environment was addressed, and examines some of the curatorial
   decisions, relationships built and challenges surrounding the display of
   Lihir performance culture in the museum context.

AB The Census of Marine Life (CoML) is an international science program to
   assess and explain the diversity, distribution and abundance of marine
   life, past, present and future. The program has three major components
   which are historical, exploratory and modeling, all of which are
   integrated into an open source database (OBIS: Ocean Biogeographic
   Information System) for visualization and analysis. In the Caribbean,
   the program began in 2004 by reviewing the state of knowledge of marine
   biodiversity in 10 countries of the region, as well as the establishment
   of a link between the CoML and research programs and conservation
   initiatives. An historical project coordinated in the Caribbean deals
   with integrating, standardizing and synthesizing the data on the early
   human impact on mollusc populations in a global perspective. This
   project is generating a Human/Molluscs Interaction Database (HMID)
   containing high quality historical data, descriptions and
   interpretations of worldwide events, patterns, processes, and products
   resulting from the interactions between humans and molluscs through
   time. Engaged exploratory projects in the Caribbean deal with the
   biodiversity of the nearshore in seagrass beds and rocky shores
   (NaGISA), and the deep sea (COMARGE). The Coral Reef (Caricoral) and
   microbes (ICOMM) projects are currently under organization in the region
   and have already established clear goals and an action plan for their
   implementation within a network. The participation of the Caribbean in
   the Ocean Tracking Network (OTN) has also been engaged. The Caribbean
   has contributed with the OBIS database through the SIBM (Sistema de
   Informacion Biogeografica Marina) of the INVEMAR in Colombia. However,
   there is an urgent need of identifying literature and collections that
   can be digitalized, georeferenced and incorporated into OBIS. The
   CoML-Caribbean is open to new partnerships and collaborations both
   within and outside the region. Within the region, it seeks to (1)
   integrate researchers in marine biodiversity, (2) consolidate available
   information on marine biodiversity, (3) learn and exchange ideas about
   national and regional plans, priorities and conservation policies and
   (4) maintain a regional committee to support CoML projects. At a global
   scale, it also seeks to explore opportunities for regional and
   international cooperation in new developing projects related to marine
   biodiversity. Rev. Biol. Trop. 56 (Suppl. 1): 171-181. Epub 2008 May 30.

AB Botanists have been urged to help assess the conservation status of all
   known plant species. For resource-poor and biodiversity-rich countries
   such assessments are scarce because of a lack of, and access to,
   information. However, the Wide range of biodiversity and geographical
   resources that are now freely available on the internet, together With
   local herbarium data, can provide sufficient information to assess the
   conservation status of plants. Such resources were used to review the
   vascular plant species endemic to Trinidad and Tobago and to assess
   their conservation status. Fifty-nine species Were found to be endemic,
   much lower than previously stated. Using the IUCN Red List criteria 18
   endemic species were assessed as Critically Endangered, 16 as
   Endangered, 15 as Vulnerable, three as Near Threatened, and three as
   Data Deficient (i.e. insufficient data are available to assess their
   conservation status). Although Such rapid assessments cannot replace in
   depth research, they provide essential baseline information to target
   research and conservation priorities and identify specific conservation
   actions.

AB Within freshwater fishes, closely related species produce alarm cues
   that are chemically similar, leading to conserved antipredator
   responses. Similar conservation trends are predicted for species with
   geographically isolated populations. Here, we tested this hypothesis
   with the guppy (Poecilia reticulata Peters, 1859) from two populations
   within the Aripo River, Trinidad. Free-ranging guppies in the Lower
   Aripo (high-predation population) exhibited more risk-aversive
   inspection behaviour towards a fish predator model paired with the alarm
   cues of guppies collected from the same population versus a river water
   control. In comparison, when paired with the alarm cues of guppies from
   the Upper Aripo (low-predation population), the response was
   intermediate. In the laboratory, we tested Upper and Lower Aripo guppies
   to the alarm cues of the same or different Aripo River donors, Quare
   River guppies (a high-predation population from a different drainage),
   or a water control. Both Upper and Lower Aripo River guppies exhibited
   the highest intensity response to donors from the same population and
   the lowest intensity response to Quare River donors, with the response
   to different Aripo donors being intermediate. Collectively, these
   results demonstrate a trend of intraspecific conservation of chemical
   alarm cue production, leading to population-specific responses to
   conspecific cues.

AB Although sponges are important components of benthic ecosystems of the
   Caribbean Sea, their diversity remained poorly investigated in the
   Lesser Antilles. By organizing a training course in Martinique, we
   wanted both to promote taxonomy and to provide a first inventory of the
   sponge diversity on this island. The course was like a naturalist
   expedition, with a field laboratory and a classroom nearby. Early-career
   scientists and environmental managers were trained in sponge taxonomy.
   We gathered unpublished data and conducted an inventory at 13 coastal
   sites. We explored only shallow water habitats (0-30 m), such as
   mangroves, reefs or rocky bottoms and underwater caves. According to
   this study, the sponge fauna of Martinique is currently represented by a
   minimum of 191 species, 134 of which we could assign species names. One
   third of the remaining non-identified sponge species we consider to be
   new to science. Martinique appears very remarkable because of its
   littoral marine fauna harboring sponge aggregations with high biomass
   and species diversity dominating over coral species. In mangroves,
   sponges cover about 10% of the surface of subtidal roots. Several
   submarine caves are true reservoirs of hidden and insufficiently
   described sponge diversity. Thanks to this new collaborative effort, the
   Eastern Caribbean has gained a significant increase of knowledge, with
   sponge diversity of this area potentially representing 40% of the total
   in the Caribbean Sea. We thus demonstrated the importance of developing
   exploratory and educational research in areas historically devoid of
   biodiversity inventories and systematics studies. Finally, we believe in
   the necessity to consider not only the number of species but their
   distribution in space to evaluate their putative contribution to
   ecosystem services and our willingness to preserve them.

AB Ciguatera fish poisoning (CFP) is a human foodborne intoxication caused
   by ingestion of tropical fishes contaminated with the potent polyether
   toxins known as ciguatoxins (CTXs). These toxins are issued from
   Gambierdiscus species of dinoflagellates. Herbivorous fish accumulate
   these toxins in their musculature and viscera after ingesting
   dinoflagellates. Epidemiological studies showed that CFP has been
   present in areas between 350 North and 350 South latitude, mainly,
   Indo-pacific and Caribbean areas, but not in waters closed to European
   and African continent. In the present paper, a specimen of Seriola
   dumerlii weighing 70 kg and a smaller Seriola fasciata specimen,
   captured in waters belonging to Selvagens Islands (Madeira Arquipelago),
   were analyzed. Fishes from this genus were implicated in previous
   suspected ciguatera poisoning outbreaks in the Portuguese Madeira
   Arquipelago in the North Atlantic Ocean. Analysis was performed by two
   approaches, a functional method using cerebellar granule cells and by
   ultraperformance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS)
   method. The study was carried out in one portion of the tail muscle of
   Seriola fasciata and five parts of the body of Seriola dumerili (tail
   muscle, head, ventral muscle, mid muscle, and liver). The functional
   method consisted in the modification of the inward sodium current in
   cerebellar granule cells and the chemical method was a high resolution
   chromatography, which allowed elucidating the toxin profile in the
   samples. In addition, UPLC-MS technique was optimized and used for
   detecting and quantifying CTXs for the first time. After fish extraction
   and clean up, the chromatograms revealed the presence of CTX-1B at
   1111.6 m/z, CTX-3C at 1023.5 m/z, a CTX analogue at 1040.6 m/z, and a
   CIX from the Caribbean or Indic waters at 1141.6 m/z. Therefore, the
   results obtained in the present paper for both methods confirm, for the
   first time, the presence of CTX in fish from Madeira Arquipelago.

   previous reports of many of these species is due to three main reasons:
   poorly sampled habitats, improved taxonomy, and being a part of a waif
   fauna. Twenty-one taxa are reported from previously inadequately sampled
   deep water (> 20 m) habitats. Twelve additional species are reported
   from shallow water in poorly sampled habitats, such as mangroves, soft
   bottom, or rocky shores. Revision in taxonomy and careful examination
   revealed seven taxa that are taxonomically distinct from forms
   previously reported from the area. Finally six rare forms may comprise a

AB Mauritius is highly reliant on fossil fuels for meeting its increasing
   energy demands. However, a lot of effort has been made over the years to
   shift towards renewable energies. This study investigated the current
   status of renewable energy exploitation in Mauritius while also
   considering other potential energy sources to further increase the
   contribution of renewable energy in the energy mix of the island. Among
   the different renewable energies studied, sugarcane bagasse combustion
   for electricity generation remains the main contributor followed by
   hydroelectricity. Considering solar and wind energy, several attempts
   have been made to promote the use of these two renewable energy sources
   but their contributions are still very low. However, solar energy, in
   the form of solar water heaters and photovoltaic panels, is being
   increasingly tapped while wind energy exploitation is also expected to
   further increase in the future. Furthermore, this study reviewed the
   huge potential of renewable energies from the ocean such as wave energy
   and ocean thermal energy conversion systems. Geothermal energy, often
   claimed as a promising renewable energy resource for Mauritius, was
   found to be unfeasible for the island. Another renewable energy
   resource, of huge potential, that is not fully explored on the island is
   bio-energy from biomass and waste materials, having an energy potential
   of 12 PJ/year. From the different sources of bio-energy investigated,
   sugarcane trash has the highest energy potential followed by the organic
   fractions of municipal solid wastes and animal manures. Finally, this
   study reviewed the different policies and legal and institutional
   frameworks governing energy in Mauritius while also addressing the
   several challenges for promotion of renewable energy on the island. For
   Mauritius to be energy sustainable, all the diverse renewable energy
   resources will need to be exploited such that the island has an

AB Serum samples obtained from livestock (cattle, chickens, pigs, sheep,
   goats and water buffaloes) slaughtered at various slaughter houses in
   Trinidad were screened for agglutinins to three zoonosis causing
   pathogens. Of a total of 751 sera tested, 2 (0.3%) originating from
   chickens were positive for Brucella abortus agglutinins using the Rose
   Bengal test (RBT), but both were negative by the tube serum
   agglutination test (SAT). Thirty-six (4.8%) of 749 sera were positive
   for Coxiella burnetii agglutinins by the capillary agglutination test
   (CAT) with the highest prevalence, 11.3%, detected in pig sera and the
   lowest, 0%, found in sheep and goat sera. The difference was not
   statistically significant (P > or = 0.05; chi 2). Of the 131 sera
   tested, 26 (19.8%) contained Toxoplasma gondii agglutinins with
   prevalences ranging from 5.5% in pigs to 42.9% in goats. It was
   concluded that livestock in Trinidad are free of B. abortus infections,
   but C. burnetii and T. gondii infections exist and are being documented
   for the first time in the island.

AB Exercise-associated hyponatremia is the most common medical complication
   of ultradistance exercise and is usually caused by excessive hypotonic
   fluid intake. We report a case of severe hyponatremia in a healthy male
   trekking the Kokoda Trail in the remote Southern Highlands of Papua New
   Guinea. A 43-year-old male collapsed and had a generalized seizure in
   the afternoon of the third day of a guided trek. He was evacuated the
   following morning and was found to have a serum sodium level of 107
   mmol/L on arrival to hospital. The case highlights that a high index of
   suspicion is required to identify patients with exercise-associated
   hyponatremia. Early diagnosis and appropriate management is critical to
   avoid the potentially fatal consequences of severe hyponatremia. The
   diagnosis and treatment of exercise-associated hyponatremia is
   particularly challenging in the remote Papua New Guinea jungle.
   Education of trek leaders, medics, and trekkers in appropriate
   preventative measures and the rapid treatment of exercise-associated
   hyponatremia is essential to avoid recurrences of this life-threatening
   condition.

AB After their emergence by 200,000 years before the present in Africa,
   modern humans colonized the globe, reaching Australia and New Guinea by
   40,000 to 50,000 years ago. Understanding how humans lived and adapted
   to the range of environments in these areas has been difficult because
   well-preserved settlements are scarce. Data from the New Guinea
   Highlands (at an elevation of similar to 2000 meters) demonstrate the
   exploitation of the endemic nut Pandanus and yams in archaeological
   sites dated to 49,000 to 36,000 years ago, which are among the oldest
   human sites in this region. The sites also contain stone tools thought
   to be used to remove trees, which suggests that the early inhabitants
   cleared forest patches to promote the growth of useful plants.

AB A large, fresh water calcareous tufa deposit occurs on a minor tributary
   of the lower Gogol River in Madang Province, Papua New Guinea. The tufa,
   apparently unique in the area, occurs just downstream of a natural
   river-tunnel in limestone. The river has a constant flow and is fringed
   by lowland rainforest. The river runs over a series of terraces formed
   by tufa dams and is unvegetated by macrophytes. The tufa is complex,
   consisting of porous, unlaminated calcite, laminated and banded
   stromatolites, and calcite encrusted insect tubes. Surfaces of the tufa
   have an epilithic community of insects, green algae, and microbes (rich
   in cyanobacteria and diatoms) that contributed to tufa formation. The
   lips of the tufa dams have a greater concentration of insect tubes,
   stromatolites, and filamentous green algae than elsewhere in the tufa.
   The associated fauna consists of caddis fly larvae (Trichoptera), midges
   (Chironomidae) and aquatic lepidopteran larvae (Pyralidae). The deposit
   is a hybrid of real stromatolites and classical tufa. This unusual
   equatorial tufa deposit indicates that tube-building insects can play a
   major role in tufa deposit construction.

   abundance on back reefs and patch reefs that have been well studied for
   >25 years. From June 2000 to June 2001, populations on back reefs have
   increased >100% (June 2001 mean densities 0.004-0.368/m(2)), while patch
   reef populations increased >350% (June 2001 densities 0.236-0.516/m(2)).
   Populations are dominated by small urchins, suggesting high recent
   recruitment. Increased Diadema densities appear to be affecting
   macroalgae abundance. The general spatio-temporal pattern of recovery
   around St. Croix seems to be following that of the die-off, suggesting
   that the same oceanographic features that spread Diadema's pathogen are
   now carrying urchin larvae.

AB Calcareous sponges of the subclass Calcinea from Martinique (Caribbean
   Sea) are presented under an integrative perspective (morphology and DNA:
   ITS and C-LSU). Eleven species of six genera have been found in
   Martinique, three of them being new to science: Borojevia crystallina
   sp. nov., Clathrina delicata sp. nov., and Ernstia adunca sp. nov. Among
   these new records, four species were previously known from other
   Caribbean localities: Arturia vansoesti, Clathrina insularis, C.
   mutabilis, and Leucaltis clathria. Two species previously known in
   Brazilian waters are reported for the first time in the Caribbean Sea:
   Arturia alcatraziensis and C. cf. cylindractina. Finally, the occurrence
   of C. aurea and Leucetta floridana in Martinique is confirmed. The two
   molecular markers (ITS and C-LSU) and the morphological characters
   considered (e.g. body shape, aquiferous system and spicules) provided
   congruent classifications what tend to confirm their reliability for the
   taxonomy of Clathrinida. After the present work, a total of 17 species
   of Calcarea are recognised for Martinique. We discuss three types of
   distribution patterns (Endemic, Caribbean-Brazil, and Amphi-Atlantic),
   Martinique likely playing an important role as stepping stone to
   garantee connectivity among populations of Calcinea in the Atlantic.

AB A new goatfish, Upeneus vanuatu (Mullidae), is described based on five
   specimens collected off two islands of Vanuatu (South Pacific), at
   depths of 191-321 m, and compared with five closely related species:
   Upeneus davidaromi (Red Sea), U. mascareinsis (Western Indian Ocean), U.
   stenopsis (northern Australia, Philippines, 127-275 m), and the more
   shallow-occurring Indo-West Pacific species U. subvittatus (26-120 m)
   and U. vittatus (<100 m). The new species can be distinguished from all
   other congeneric species by the combination of four characters: number
   of gill rakers on lower limb, caudal-peduncle depth, interorbital
   length, and interdorsal distance. Strong allometric variation in body
   form between the holotype and the four smaller paratypes was found.
   Based on the lack of lateral body stripes, a rather narrow caudal
   peduncle depth, and large eyes in adults as common characteristics for
   U. subvittatus and the four deep-water Upeneus species, the so-called
   "stenopsis" species group can be distinguished from four other species
   groups that were established in earlier studies in order to facilitate
   intrageneric comparisons. The ecological and evolutionary significance
   of deep-water goatfishes is briefly discussed.

AB The great sensitivity of coral reefs to climate change has raised
   concern over their resilience. An emerging body of resilience theory
   stems largely from research carried out in a single biogeographic
   region; the Caribbean. Such geographic bias raises the question of
   transferability of concepts among regions. In this article, we identify
   factors that might predispose the Caribbean to its low resilience,
   including faster rates of macroalgal growth, higher rates of algal
   recruitment, basin-wide iron-enrichment of algal growth from aeolian
   dust, a lack of acroporid corals, lower herbivore biomass and missing
   groups of herbivores. Although mechanisms of resilience are likely to be
   ubiquitous, our analysis suggests that Indo-Pacific reefs would have to
   be heavily degraded to exhibit bistability or undergo coral macroalgal
   phase shifts.

AB Solomon Islands is a country of biodiversity, but also has a large
   proportion of the fruit fly species present in the South Pacific region.
   At least 50 fruit fly species, many of which are unique and endemic,
   have been collected through trapping and host fruit surveys. Trapping
   has been carried out using two different types of male insect lures:
   methyl eugenol and Cue-lure. Bactrocera frauenfeldi, B. umbrosa, B.
   cucurbitae and Dacus solomonensis are common and economic fruit fly
   species. B. musae is said to attack banana but is not common. However,
   its purported existence in Solomon Islands may impose quarantine
   restrictions to markets overseas and, therefore, its presence requires
   confirmation. The majority of the other species are not economic and
   develop in wild host fruits. At least one species has been introduced.
   B. cucurbitae was first detected in 1984 in Solomon Islands and is
   currently spreading eastward. It is now found in all provinces except
   Rennell/Bellona, Makira and Temotu. Serious economic species such as B.
   tryoni, Ceratitis capitata and dorsalis complex pests might easily spill
   over into Solomon Islands from surrounding countries. There is an urgent
   need for a proper and workable quarantine surveillance system.

   2010 to determine the possible risk factors associated with the high
   prevalence of child malnutrition. In-depth interviews were conducted to
   32 guardians of children aged younger than 5 years. It was observed that
   early termination of exclusive breast-feeding and a short lactation
   period along with an unsanitary living environment were associated with
   the nutritional status of children in the study area. Although previous
   surveys have reported poor food security conditions in the country, no
   statements from the subjects supported this contention. The identified
   possible risk factors for child malnutrition were closely linked to each
   other and were mostly modifiable.

AB Low-lying reef islands in the Solomon Islands provide a valuable window
   into the future impacts of global sea-level rise. Sea-level rise has
   been predicted to cause widespread erosion and inundation of low-lying
   atolls in the central Pacific. However, the limited research on reef
   islands in the western Pacific indicates the majority of shoreline
   changes and inundation to date result from extreme events, seawalls and
   inappropriate development rather than sea-level rise alone. Here, we
   present the first analysis of coastal dynamics from a sea-level rise
   hotspot in the Solomon Islands. Using time series aerial and satellite
   imagery from 1947 to 2014 of 33 islands, along with historical insight
   from local knowledge, we have identified five vegetated reef islands
   that have vanished over this time period and a further six islands
   experiencing severe shoreline recession. Shoreline recession at two
   sites has destroyed villages that have existed since at least 1935,
   leading to community relocations. Rates of shoreline recession are
   substantially higher in areas exposed to high wave energy, indicating a
   synergistic interaction between sea-level rise and waves. Understanding
   these local factors that increase the susceptibility of islands to
   coastal erosion is critical to guide adaptation responses for these
   remote Pacific communities.

AB This study examines the morphological, taxonomic, ecological, and
   ontogenetic correlates of mite-eating (acariphagy) in anurans to
   increase our understanding of diet specialization in vertebrate
   "insectivores."  In a review of the literature (Part I), mites were
   abundant in terrestrial habitats at many locations worldwide, yet mites
   are not commonly reported as prey in anuran diets.  In a detailed study
   of tropical ground-dwelling anurans (Part II), the diets of all species
   included mites.  In both the literature review and detailed study, mites
   constituted up to 45% of the diet (by number) of some species.  In the
   paleotropics, at one montane cloud forest site in New Guinea, frogs ate
   mites in the same high proportions (45%) as they occurred in the
   substrate.  In the neotropics, certain small anurans specialized on
   mites, in that they ate mites in higher proportions than occurred in the
   leaf litter (proportion of mites in the diet and in the environment was
   lower at these locations than at the New Guinea site).  Neotropical mite
   specialists included juveniles of several species and adults of small
   dendrobatids in the genus Minyobates.  Mites in the neotropics
   apparently constitute prey equivalent to ants and are included on the
   small end of the size continuum by species in the "ant-specialist"
   guild.  We hypothesize that mites, like ants, present low costs of
   search and pursuit because they are abundant and slow-moving relative to
   anuran predators.  The trade-off, however, is that these prey contain a
   higher proportion of chitin and are therefore costly to digest (e.g.,
   require special enzymes, slow rate of passage) as primary prey.  Nothing
   is known of the digestive physiology of anurans that specialize on mites
   and ants.

AB Long-held traditions of international mobility, emigration, and
   temporary circulation, and of family-centered networks, together forge
   intra-regional and extra-regional systems of social exchanges, transfers
   and support structures that directly and indirectly influence the
   development of the Caribbean region. Today's mobilized diasporas exhibit
   multi-local "moorings" or locales within the Caribbean region and
   beyond: in this hemisphere (North America) and trans-Atlantic (in
   Europe). Family (and "friendship") networks, wider kin networks, ethnic
   networks, and inter-network exchanges and transfers, all facilitate
   people's mobilities and cross-border exchanges of goods, information,
   technology, monetary and non-monetary remittances, and social capital.
   In this article the potential of the Caribbean's diasporic spaces to be
   new socio-structural agencies in global development policy is assessed
   and found to be both promising and achievable. Within such "spaces"
   there are multi-layered processes of transnational immigrant
   incorporation overseas, and cross-border transnational mobilities,
   social experiences, exchanges, and practices. In particular, monetary
   and social remittances and returning nationals can be critical
   influences in forging, creating, and consolidating what is
   re-conceptualized in this article as "transnational capacity-building".
   Following the establishment of our theoretical generalizations and
   conceptualizations of the migration-development nexus of the
   contemporary Caribbean, the detailed "coming together" of
   transnationalism, the migration-development nexus, transnational
   capacity-building and "diaspora spaces" is formulated. Then, an
   empirical section follows, in which we utilize "narratives" gathered by
   the authors in several Caribbean locales during the earlyto-middle 2000
   decade to support our theoretical arguments and behavioral findings.
   Based upon the conceptual arguments and their empirical substantiation
   drawn from the quotes of returning nationals, we conclude that both
   economic and social "change for the better" appear to be possible in the
   most promising developmental contexts that the Caribbean offers, due to
   Caribbean people's enduring propensity for transnational mobility
   options as a "strategic flexibility that still works".

AB Recent studies have shown that some coral reef fish larvae return to
   natal reefs, while others disperse to distant reefs. However, the
   sensory mechanisms used to find settlement sites are poorly understood.
   One hypothesis is that larvae use olfactory cues to navigate home or
   find other suitable reef habitats. Here we show a strong association
   between the clownfish Amphiprion percula and coral reefs surrounding
   offshore islands in Papua New Guinea. Host anemones and A. percula are
   particularly abundant in shallow water beneath overhanging rainforest
   vegetation. A series of experiments were carried out using paired-choice
   flumes to evaluate the potential role of water-borne olfactory cues in
   finding islands. Recently settled A. percula exhibited strong
   preferences for: (i) water from reefs with islands over water from reefs
   without islands; (ii) water collected near islands over water collected
   offshore; and (iii) water treated with either anemones or leaves from
   rainforest vegetation. Laboratory reared-juveniles exhibited the same
   positive response to anemones and rainforest vegetation, suggesting that
   olfactory preferences are innate rather than learned. We hypothesize
   that A. percula use a suite of olfactory stimuli to locate vegetated
   islands, which may explain the high levels of self-recruitment on island
   reefs. This previously unrecognized link between coral reefs and island
   vegetation argues for the integrated management of these pristine
   tropical habitats.

AB The first Vanuatu archaeological site discovery dates back to the 1960s,
   then the scientific and archaeological knowledge of this archipelago
   have increased. Nevertheless, the human activities-palaeoenvironmental
   changes relation in Vanuatu is still a matter of debate. In order to
   better determine this relation, reviewing the literature on past and
   actual environment is needed. This paper presents here a state of
   knowledge on Vanuatu geology, climate, biodiversity and archaeology,
   from the mid-Holocene to our present-day. The young archipelago results
   from strong volcanic and tectonic activity, due to the active subduction
   zone between Australian and Pacific plates. The atmosphere-ocean
   interactions determine the wet and dry seasons. Fauna and flora are
   principally derived from Southeast Asia. The occurrence of several
   species and subspecies endemic to the archipelago, if not to some
   islands, is probably due to the Vanuatu isolated location, the size of
   the islands and the climatic gradient between north and south. The first
   human. populations reached the archipelago around 3200 yr BP. The Lapita
   culture, characterized by decorated potteries, is shared across the
   whole Vanuatu between 3200 and 2900 yr BP. After 2900 yr BP, cultures
   differ from one island to another. After 600 yr BP, the Polynesian
   culture dominates in Vanuatu.

AB No other group of insects have been more successful in colonizing marine
   habitats than water striders and their allies (Heteroptera,
   Gerromorpha). More than 10% of the 1700 species of gerromorphan bugs are
   marine. Water striders have colonized the marine environment at least 14
   times. The fossil records suggest that marine habitats were invaded by
   members of the families Veliidae and Gerridae earlier than 20-30 and 45
   million years before present, respectively. Estuaries and mangrove
   swamps are undoubtedly the ancestral type of habitat, but water striders
   have diversified further in marine habitats including the surface of the
   open ocean (sea skaters, Halobates). Except for being obligatorily
   flightless, marine water striders are structurally very similar to their
   non-marine relatives. Physiological and behavioral rather than
   morphological specializations are likely to have been key innovations in
   the transition from limnic to marine habitats. The oldest and most
   species-rich clades originated in the Indo-West Pacific region. There
   are 3.5 times as many species of marine water striders in the Indo-West
   Pacific region than in the Atlantic/Caribbean/East Pacific region. This
   "diversity anomaly" is explained historically by region-specific
   differences in the origin and proliferation of clades, in paleoclimate
   and paleogeography, and in the propensity for dispersal between regions.

   jamaicensis from three locations in south Eleuthera, The Bahamas and
   compared with ambient infauna via sediment surveys. Diets were
   relatively limited with a total of 535 prey items recovered,
   representing five taxonomic groups and dominated by polychaetes and
   decapod crustaceans (87% of total diet), while environmental sampling
   reported 5249 individual taxa represented by 62 taxonomic groups.
   Regardless of gravidity, sex or density of prey items among sites, no
   significant differences were detected. Foraging strategy plots suggested
   preferential prey is rare within the environment and the Manly-Chesson
   index validates polychaetes were consumed with high selectivity. This is
   the most comprehensive and updated assessment of comparative feeding in
   this species, particularly for The Bahamas, allowing insight into
   invertebrate community richness and diversity in ecologically sensitive
   coastal and nearshore habitats.

AB The 2017 North Atlantic hurricane season was one of the most active in
   recent history. The season recorded a total of 17 named storms, of which
   10 became hurricanes and 6 became major hurricanes, and an Accumulated
   Cyclone Energy (ACE) index of 226. The number of major hurricanes was
   joint second highest since 1970, and the ACE index was third highest. We
   show that the Met Office Atlantic seasonal tropical cyclone forecast,
   initialised on May 15, 2017, predicted an increased risk of
   above-average activity. The forecast also captured aspects of the
   spatial distribution of the tropical cyclones, such as the high
   frequency of tracks which crossed the northeast Caribbean in September
   2017, at more than 3 months lead time. We show that the high levels of
   seasonal activity, particularly in terms of major hurricanes and ACE
   index, were likely a result of a combination of low wind shear in the
   western Atlantic, above-average tropical Atlantic sea surface
   temperatures (SSTs) and a transition to cooler SSTs in the tropical
   Pacific due to a developing La Nina event, all of which appear to be
   predictable at seasonal lead times. This study provides evidence for
   seasonal predictability of the intense 2017 Atlantic hurricane season,
   including advanced warning of an increased risk of tropical cyclones
   transiting the northeast Caribbean.

AB Ecosystem fragmentation is one of the most damaging anthropogenic
   impacts to aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems worldwide. In this study,
   we analyzed population-level characteristics of a resilient top
   predator, the gray snapper (Lutjanus griseus), across a gradient of
   fragmentation in Bahamian tidal creeks. Analysis of hydrologic
   connectivity (the inverse of fragmentation) and site-specific population
   parameters revealed that varying degrees of connectivity translated into
   predictable characteristics in fish populations. Less-fragmented systems
   produced fast-growing snapper with high condition factors, whereas more
   fragmented tidal creeks yielded slow-growing snapper with low condition
   factors. Underlying reasons for growth rate differences likely
   originated from structural and functional shifts in tidal creek
   ecosystems following fragmentation. Such ecosystem-level shifts were
   reflected by low per-individual volumes of consumed prey, as well as
   increased parasite infestations. Results indicated that aquatic
   ecosystem fragmentation may affect long-term fitness and viability of
   resilient species capable of persisting in fragmented habitats. Our
   results from estuarine tidal creeks compare well with studies on
   fragmentation of freshwater streams by dams and suggest that
   population-level consequences following ecosystem fragmentation may be
   generalizable between seemingly disparate aquatic environments.

AB Internesting dive behavior of 3 leatherback sea turtles near Rantau
   Abang, Malaysia, is presented. Diving patterns were similar to
   leatherbacks in the Caribbean in that there was almost no period when
   the turtles were not diving, and dives were influenced by time of day.
   Daytime dives were longer, deeper, and had longer post-dive surface
   intervals than night-time dives. Bottom durations were also longer
   during the day. Major differences between Caribbean and Malaysian
   leatherbacks were the depth and durations of the dives. Malaysian
   turtles were constrained by the shallow waters of the South China Sea to
   dives less than 60 m, and indeed many of their dives appeared to be to
   the bottom. Dive durations were much longer for Malaysian turtles. We
   suggest that this may be due to a lower metabolic demand of diving by
   Malaysian turtles, possibly because they were resting on or near the
   bottom on each dive. Bottom times were greater than 3 minutes in 47% of
   all dives, which is distinctly different than Caribbean leatherback
   diving. There was a strong correlation between dive depth and dive
   duration but only a weak relationship (if any) between dive duration and
   bottom time and none between dive duration and post-dive surface time.

AB The transition of many Caribbean reefs from coral to macroalgal
   dominance has been a prominent issue in coral reef ecology for more than
   20 years. Alternative stable state theory predicts that these changes
   are reversible but, to date, there is little indication of this having
   occurred. Here we present evidence of the initiation of such a reversal
   in Jamaica, where shallow reefs at five sites along 8 km of coastline
   now are characterized by a sea urchin-grazed zone with a mean width of
   60 m. In comparison to the seaward algal zone, macroalgae are rare in
   the urchin zone, where the density of Diadema antillarum is 10 times
   higher and the density of juvenile corals is up to 11 times higher.
   These densities are close to those recorded in the late 1970s and early
   1980s and are in striking contrast to the decade-long recruitment
   failure for both Diadema and scleractinians. If these trends continue
   and expand spatially. reefs throughout the Caribbean may again become
   dominated by corals and algal turf.

   Rongelap, UtrAik, and Enewetak Atolls in the Marshall Islands designed
   to take a representative sample of food supplies with emphasis on
   determining Cs-137 activity concentrations in common food plants.
   Coconuts (Cocos nucifera L.) are the most common and abundant food
   plant, and provided a common sample type to characterize the level and
   variability of activity concentrations of Cs-137 in plant foods
   collected from different islands and atolls. Other dominant food types
   included Pandanus (Pandanus spp.) and breadfruit (Actocarpus spp.). In
   general, the activity concentration of Cs-137 in food plants was found
   to decrease significantly between the main residence islands on Bikini,
   Rongelap, UtrAik, and Enewetak Atolls. The mean activity concentration
   of Cs-137 measured in drinking coconut meat and juice was 0.72 (95 % CI
   0.68-0.77) and 0.34 (95 % CI 0.30-0.38) Bq g(-1), respectively, on

   variability are reported across all islands. These results will be used
   to improve the accuracy and reliability of predictive dose assessments,
   help characterize levels of uncertainty and variability in activity

AB A freshwater plume from the Fly River, Papua New Guinea, stretched to
   the south-west over a distance of more than 150 km from the estuary
   towards Torres Strait. The highly turbid freshwater was mixed with the
   relatively clear water of the Gulf of Papua, producing a sharp boundary
   around 23 salinity. Sediment concentrations were typically more than 50
   mg 1(-1) inside the turbid water mass, and were rapidly reduced to a few
   milligrams per litre in the area where salinity was still as low as 26.
   The area had relatively high levels of phytoplankton (>1 mu g chl
   1(-1)), resulting in rapid depletion of nitrate and phosphate.
   Biological as well as physico-chemical (flocculation) processes seemed
   responsible for the rapid removal of sediments from the plume. Settling
   particles collected near the estuary consisted largely of fine sediments
   bound loosely by flocculant organic matter, and contained very few
   plankton and their remains. Further away from the estuary, however,
   settling panicles were dominated by colonies of phytoplankton, fecal
   pellets and macroscopic aggregates of apparently biological origin. Fine
   sediments were found firmly attached to or embedded in these settling
   particles. The area of high biological activities in the plume probably
   functions as a barrier, limiting a further offshore transport of
   sediments. (C) 1997 Academic Press Limited.

AB Nineteen areas on the island of Hispaniola (Haiti and the Dominican
   Republic) were studied with the aim of determining the distribution
   pattern of the endemic flora in these areas, and their variability with
   altitude. The main concentration of endemic species occurs in mountains
   with a medium altitude and in certain mountain sites (palaeo-islands),
   which coincide with hotspots; a lower number of endemics are found in
   low-lying areas (coldspots), due to the degradation of their habitats. A
   total of 1,582 endemic species were studied and were distributed in 19
   areas. The whole island is of outstanding interest for its richness in
   endemics; it has 2,050 endemic species, representing 34.16% of its total
   flora. The territory in the study is home to 1,284 genera of which 31
   are endemic to the island, including monotypical genera such as
   Tortuella abietifolia Urb. & Ekman, and endemic genera such as Hottea,
   containing seven endemic species. The sites with the highest rate of
   endemics are area A16 in the central range with a total of 440 endemic
   species, of which 278 are exclusive to the territory; and the Sierra de
   Bahoruco, la Selle, La Hotte and Tiburon in area A12, where we found 699
   plants of which 482 are endemic and exclusive to the area; and A13 with
   173 and 129 respectively. This work highlights the exceptional floristic
   diversity in endemic species and genera and analyses their distribution
   patterns as a tool for conservation in this area of the world, whose
   high endemicity rate makes it one of the most significant hotspots in

AB The hydrological and geochemical properties of the waters constituting
   the Pacific Equatorial Undercurrent (EUC) determine the properties of
   the equatorial cold tongue. Understanding and quantifying the various
   EUC origins is therefore of prime importance. For this purpose, a
   high-resolution (1/4 degrees) interannual oceanic simulation was
   analyzed from the western tropical Pacific boundaries to 140 degrees W,
   using a Lagrangian framework. Waters from the Low-Latitude Western
   Boundary Currents (LLWBCs) transiting from Vitiaz Strait (the main
   contributor), from Solomon Strait, and via the Mindanao Current were
   identified as the principal sources to the EUC. Waters conveyed by the
   interior ocean off equator are negligible till 180 E. The LLWBCs' waters
   represent 87% of the EUC transport at 156 degrees E out of which the New
   Guinea Coastal Undercurrent (NGCU) is as large as 47%. The EUC
   meridional distribution suggests that the waters originating from
   Solomon Strait and Mindanao Current mostly remain in the hemisphere from
   which they originate. Contrastingly, Vitiaz Strait waters are found in
   both hemispheres. The vertical EUC distribution shows that the lower
   layer of the EUC is mainly composed of Vitiaz Strait waters. Finally,
   the source transport distributions were characterized, at their origin
   and within the EUC, as a function of density. These distributions showed
   that waters flowing through Vitiaz Strait at densities higher than those
   of the EUC (down to sigma(theta) = 27.2 kg m(-3)) undergo a diapycnal
   mixing and lighten during their journey to join the EUC. This lightening
   supports the suggestion that the NGCU is a major source for the EUC
   geochemical enrichment.

AB Recently, the Caribbean reef-building coral Orbicella faveolata was
   listed as "threatened" under the U.S. Endangered Species Act. Despite
   attention to this species' conservation, the extent of geographic
   variation within O. faveolata warrants further investigation. O.
   faveolata is unusual in that it can simultaneously harbor multiple
   genetically distinct and co-dominant species of endosymbiotic
   dinoflagellates in the genus Symbiodinium. Here, we investigate the
   geographic and within-colony complexity of Symbiodinium-O. faveolata
   associations from Florida Keys, USA; Exuma Cays, Bahamas; Puerto
   Morelos, Mexico; and Carrie Bow Cay, Belize. We collected coral samples
   along intracolony axes, and Symbiodinium within O. faveolata samples was
   analyzed using the nuclear ITS2 region and chloroplast 23S rDNA
   genotyping. O. faveolata associated with species of Symbiodinium in
   clades A (type A3), B (B1 and B17), C (C3, C7, and C7a), and D
   (D1a/Symbiodinium trenchii). Within-colony distributions of Symbiodinium
   species correlated with light availability, cardinal direction, and
   depth, resulting in distinct zonation patterns of endosymbionts within a
   host. Symbiodinium species from clades A and B occurred predominantly in
   the light-exposed tops, while species of clade C generally occurred in
   the shaded sides of colonies or in deeper-water habitats. Furthermore,
   geographic comparisons of host-symbiont associations revealed regional
   differences in Symbiodinium associations. Symbiodinium A3 was detected
   in Mesoamerican coral colonies, but not in colonies from the Florida
   Keys or Bahamas. Likewise, Symbiodinium B17 was unique to Mesoamerican
   O. faveolata, whereas Symbiodinium B1 was found at all localities
   sampled. However, using cp23S genotyping paired with ITS2 analysis
   revealed geographically endemic haplotypes among Symbiodinium clades A,
   B, and C. Since Symbiodinium spatial heterogeneity among this coral
   species is greater than most corals, a question arises as to whether all
   western Atlantic populations of O. faveolata should be considered
   equally "threatened"? Alternatively, geographically and spatially
   distinct coral-symbiont associations may benefit from specialized
   management protocols.

   Kenya-following initiation of closed-area management. I examined the
   response of the taxa and functional groups at different trophic levels
   and the numbers of species of major groups (algae, coral, sea urchins,
   and fish), and compared these reefs to those where fishing continues to
   take place. There was a great deal of scatter in the responses of the
   various taxa to closed-area management, suggesting complex trophic
   dynamics. The patterns were clearer and trophic cascades more easily
   identified when taxa were pooled into functional groups. Higher trophic
   levels generally increased in number, whereas lower trophic levels
   experienced fewer changes. Cascading effects were evident for some but
   not all groups, suggesting a mix of strong and weakly interacting
   species and functional groups. Such patterns also varied between the two
   protected areas. In both sites, numbers of species generally increased
   for fish, particularly those affected by fishing, but less so for other
   groups at the lower trophic levels, which may be more influenced by
   abiotic factors. Consequently, the control of species diversity in both
   studied sites results from an interaction between biotic and abiotic
   forces and not by predator-induced cascades alone.

AB Cousine Island, Seychelles, is of major conservation significance as it
   is in a biodiversity hotspot. Furthermore, it is relatively pristine,
   and is apparently the only tropical island over 20 ha with no alien
   invasive mammals. This study focuses on the island's log and litter
   arthropods, which were sampled by extraction methods from the dominant
   species, Pisonia grandis, Ficus spp. and Cocos nucifera. Stage of
   decomposition, and forest type in which the logs occurred, both
   significantly influenced the composition and structure of the arthropod
   assemblages. Young logs were significantly richer in species than older
   logs, possibly because they had the most resources and microhabitats.
   There were some significant changes in arthropod species richness,
   composition and abundance between species of young logs, but not old
   ones, because as logs decomposed, arthropod assemblages converged.
   Nevertheless, each old log species had some arthropod species not
   present in other log species, which has important implications for
   conservation. Arthropod assemblages in woody litter varied according to
   the forest type in which they occurred, and were different from those in
   logs in the same forest type. Cousine Island arthropod species richness,
   both in logs and litter, was comparable to figures from other tropical
   areas. As the logs, especially P. grandis, are home to many Seychelles
   endemic species, their conservation is essential. Furthermore, as the
   arthropods are also the main food of certain threatened Seychelles
   vertebrates, their conservation also underpins a food chain on this
   unique tropical island.

   specimens. The genus is redescribed, and redescriptions are provided for
   G. australis ( Blackburn), G. brisbanensis ( Blackburn), G. clarki
   (Deane), G. levis (Deane), G. lividus (Deane), G. notalis (Deane), and
   G. tenebricosus ( Deane). Lectotypes are designated for Ochthebius
   australis Blackburn, 1888, and Ochthebius tenebricosus Deane, 1931.
   Ochthebius fischeri Deane, 1931, and Ochthebius leai Deane, 1931, are
   synonymized with Ochthebius australis Blackburn, 1888; Ochthebius
   flavocinctus Deane 1933, is synonymized with Ochthebius lividus Deane,
   1933; and Ochthebius angustipennis Deane, 1931, is synonymized with
   Ochthebius clarki Deane, 1931. Twenty-nine new species are described,
   and a key to the 36 species known from Australia and Papua New Guinea is
   given. High resolution digital images of all primary types are presented
   (online version in color), the male genitalia are illustrated, and
   Australian geographic distributions are mapped. Only one species, G.
   clarki, inhabits both Australia and Papua New Guinea; two species, G.
   bacchusi n. sp. and G. papua n. sp. are endemic to Papua New Guinea; 33
   species are endemic to Australia. Members of Gymnochthebius are found at
   the gravelly/sandy/silty margins of flowing and standing water. A
   preliminary grouping of species according to microhabitat substrate is
   presented. Correspondences between ventral morphology and microhabitat
   preferences suggest that a few species are evolving toward humicolous
   habits. New species of Gymnochthebius are: G. angulonotus ( Queensland,
   Tinaroo Creek Road via Mareeba), G. bacchusi ( Papua New Guinea, Morobe

AB Although it is not happening uniformly within the country, the adoption
   of a modern lifestyle by Papua New Guineans is affecting their food
   habits and choices. More and more people consume rice, tinned fish and
   tinned meat. In towns and in villages with easy access to urban centres,
   these food items comprise an ever increasing part of the diet. These
   dietary changes are leading to increases in the prevalence of chronic
   lifestyle-related diseases such as obesity, hypertension and coronary
   heart disease. Although average calorie availability is similar in urban
   and rural sectors, at around 2600 kilocalories per person per day, the
   nutritional outcomes are different. This is mainly due to the higher
   energy density of the modern urban diet with a greater intake of fat and
   protein. The traditional diet is low in protein with rather high energy
   content from starchy root crops. Studies have shown that urban children
   tend to be taller and heavier than their rural counterparts and that the
   prevalence of overweight and obesity is higher among adults in urban
   than in rural areas. Finally, across all income groups and geographical
   regions, more women than men are chronically undernourished.

   explored using mask and snorkel, and occasionally scuba equipment,
   during ten days. Forty-one species are added to the species known for
   the region. Our current estimate of sponge diversity in shallow exposed
   marine habitats of Bocas del Toro is 120 species. Twenty-three species
   are added to the Panamanian sponge fauna, four of which are new species
   currently being described. A patchy distribution was observed for most
   of the sponge species, while few species were present at all sites
   visited. Approximately 23% (30 species) of the diversity encountered was
   widely distributed. The species composition of the most typical or
   common sponges from reef, seagrass beds, or mangrove habitats, agrees
   with that of other Caribbean sites. An appendix with a field guide to
   the species encountered in this study is presented.

AB Recent multidisciplinary investigations document an independent
   emergence of agriculture at Kuk Swamp in the highlands of Papua New
   Guinea. In this paper we report preliminary usewear analysis and details
   of prehistoric use of stone tools for processing starchy food and other
   plants at Kuk Swamp. Morphological diagnostics for starch granules are
   reported for two potentially significant economic species, taro
   (Colocasia esculenta) and yam (Dioscorea sp.), following comparisons
   between prehistoric and botanical reference specimens. Usewear and
   residue analyses of starch granules indicate that both these species
   were processed on the wetland margin during the early and mid Holocene.
   We argue that processing of taro and yam commences by at least 10,200
   calibrated years before present (cal BP), although the taro and yam
   starch granules do not permit us to distinguish between wild or
   cultivated forms. From at least 6950 to 6440 cal BP the processing of
   taro, yarn and other plants indicates that they are likely to have been
   integrated into cultivation practices on the wetland edge. (c) 2005

AB Hot pepper (Capsicum chinense Jacq.) is an economically important
   commercial crop cultivated in Trinidad for domestic consumption and for
   export in its fresh and processed forms. Collar rot and wilting symptoms
   have been observed in major hot pepper producing areas of Trinidad over
   several years, resulting in severe crop losses. Isolations were made
   from infected plants using corn meal agar (CMA) amended with
   antibiotics. The isolated organism was identified as Phytophthora
   capsici based on morphological and microscopic observations. Inoculation
   of zoospores of P. capsici onto healthy seedlings confirmed the typical
   expression of symptoms of collar rot and wilting in hot peppers under
   greenhouse conditions. PCR amplification and nucleotide sequencing of
   the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region of rDNA using the primers
   ITS4 and ITS6 and of the mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase gene using
   primers FMPhy-8b and FMPhy-10b confirmed the pathogen as P. capsici. To
   the best of our knowledge, this is the first report identifying and
   confirming P. capsici affecting hot peppers in Trinidad.

AB Reef fish are critical in maintaining the ecological function of coral
   reefs and providing food security for coastal communities in developing
   countries. Reef fishery stocks are under increasing threat from factors
   such as climate-related habitat degradation, land use practices, and
   resource extraction related to human population growth, direct
   consumption and increasing connectivity between the in situ fishery and
   fish markets. This study investigates how reef fish stocks are related
   to environmental, localised resource use and market proximity indicators
   across 51 sites in the Solomon Islands. Hard coral cover is the best
   indicator of total target fishery biomass, with cover of less than
   around 31% associated with significantly less biomass than sites with
   higher coral cover. Direct resource use indicators such as fish
   consumption and fish sale pressure were poor predictors of target fish
   biomass. Distance of the fishery resource from community, provincial
   sub-station, provincial capital and national capital are all
   significantly and positively correlated with biomass for four key
   fishery families: Acanthuridae (surgeonfish), Scaridae (parrotfish),
   Lethrinidae (emperor), Lutjanidae (snapper). Multiple spatial scale
   relationships are evident between market proximity indicators and
   Lutjanidae and Scaridae families. Thus, while pooled target fishery
   biomass is constrained by environment, analysis at fishery family
   resolution reveals the effects of anthropogenic impact through market
   proximity on constraining fishery biomass distribution in the Solomon
   Islands. This study highlights the need for reef fishery managers and
   conservation practitioners to focus attention on proximity of resources
   to markets to sustain the ecological health of reef dominated
   ecosystems. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB A non-randomized assessment of long-term biosand filter (BSF) use and

   conducted during March, 2011. Of the 55 BSFs visited, 47% were no longer
   in use. Filter lifespan ranged from <1 year to systems still in use
   after 12 years. Interviews with BSF owners revealed problems related to
   intermittent filter use due to travel for employment or personal
   matters; broken or missing filter parts; and fears that the filter would
   not be effective against cholera. In addition, 17 BSF field studies were
   reviewed to identify common issues impacting usage. Culturally
   appropriate technologies and education materials explaining proper
   maintenance and operation are essential for improved filter performance
   and sustainability. For Haiti, education materials should be provided in
   Creole and French and should include, (1) diagrams and descriptions of
   how the BSF works, (2) how to troubleshoot common problems, (3) how to
   properly maintain filters, and (4) a contact in case of questions.
   Operational problems can be minimized by providing long-term technical
   support, periodic water quality monitoring, and maintenance assistance
   for filter users.

AB A major pathway of the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation (MOC)
   is the warm inflow into the Caribbean Sea. The transport and the
   contribution of water from the South Atlantic is calculated from
   observations (ADCP data and hydrography) and compared to the results of
   the 1/12 degrees FLAME model. The model and the observations show high
   consistency in the strength of the mean total inflow and its range of
   variability as well as in the general distribution of water from South
   Atlantic origin. The measurements give an annual mean South Atlantic
   Water (SAW) transport into the Caribbean of 9.3 Sv with high
   variability. This estimate has to be regarded as a lower bound since the
   present method (using temperature and salinity data) cannot identify the
   SAW included in the North Equatorial Current (NEC), which recirculated
   and was transformed in the interior tropical Atlantic. The model
   transport reproduces the observational values rather closely, with an
   annual mean inflow of 8.6 Sv and similar high variability. Closer
   inspection of the SAW pathways in the model suggest that the additional
   contribution by the NEC-pathway is only about 2 Sv. The model results
   confirm the relative importance of the MOC pathways suggested by
   observations: the Caribbean inflow seems to be the main pathway (63%)
   for the warm and central water (sigma(theta) < 27.1 kg m(-3)), whereas
   for the intermediate water a larger fraction (59%) is transported
   northward at the eastern side of the Lesser Antilles.

AB Aim This study considered the colonization of disturbed island
   ecosystems by Ficus species (Moraceae). Specifically, we examined the
   extent of colonization (compared with source areas), differential roles
   of seed dispersing birds and mammals, and the Ficus fruit characters
   influencing mode of colonization.
   Location Research was conducted on Long Island (5degrees20'S;
   147degrees10'E), a volcanic island 55 km from Papua New Guinea, which
   erupted catastrophically in c. 1645 with probable extirpation of all
   life. Renewed volcanic activity in the early 1950s produced a series of
   temporary islands in the volcano's caldera lake. One island, Motmot,
   present since 1968 has persisted.
   Methods Long Island and Motmot were surveyed over 15 days for Ficus
   species and their vertebrate dispersers and pollinating wasps. The Ficus
   community was compared with that of mainland sources areas and Ficus
   species present were characterised according to their figs' size,
   colour, crop size and height. Observations of frugivory and literature
   records were used to determine Ficus dispersal guild membership.
   Results At least 31 Ficus species have colonized Long Island since its
   eruption. Evidence of pollinator wasp colonisation was found for all
   sixteen Ficus species observed fruiting. Thirty-six vertebrate species
   occurring on Long Island are identified as potential seed dispersers. Of
   these, fruit bats and pigeons are likely to have been instrumental in
   the island's early colonization with subsequent spread being facilitated
   by these frugivores as well as a number of smaller birds, and an
   introduced cuscus. Comparisons of fruit characters and frugivore,
   attraction between Ficus species reveal two broad dispersal guilds.
   Members of the first guild produce relatively large, green figs in the
   lower strata of the forest and attract fruit bats. The second guild
   includes species, that attract both birds and fruit bats with generally
   smaller, red figs produced throughout the vertical structure of the
   forest. Eight Ficus species have colonized Motmot, a 31-year-old
   emergent island in the volcano's crater lake. However, only one
   furgivore species was recorded alive on the island. Fig seeds are likely
   to have arrived during rare over-flights or roosting visits by
   frugivores, or in the bodies of prey brought to Motmot by raptors. We
   found no evidence of pollinator presence on Motmot. Most Ficus
   individuals on Motmot remain immature and the figs of the only three
   individuals observed with crops had not been pollinated.

AB Near Port Moresby in Papua New Guinea, three of four adult family
   members who ate a porcupine fish (Diodon hystrix) were severely
   poisoned. Within one hour of the meal, both the mother and her older
   daughter had developed paraesthesiae, ataxia, hypersalivation, sweating,
   and had collapsed and died. The younger daughter developed similar
   symptoms with progressive paralysis requiring mechanical ventilation for
   24 hr, but she made a complete recovery IO days after the poisoning. In
   this patient, nerve conduction studies showed reduced sensory and motor
   conduction velocities and evoked amplitudes with gradual improvement in
   parallel with the patient's clinical condition, consistent with the
   known action of tetrodotoxin on voltage-gated sodium channels.

AB Many studies have suggested that long-range transport of African desert
   dusts across the Atlantic Ocean occurs, delivering key nutrients and
   contributing to fertilization of the Amazon rainforest. Here we utilize
   radiogenic isotope tracers - Sr, Nd and Pb - to derive the provenance,
   local or remote, and pathways of dust transport from Africa to the
   Caribbean. Atmospheric total suspended particulate (TSP) matter was
   collected in 2008 on quartz fibre filters, from both sides of the
   Atlantic Ocean at three different locations: in Mali (12.6 degrees N,
   8.0 degrees W; 555 m a.s.l.), Tobago (11.3 degrees N, 60.5 degrees W;
   329 m a.s.l.) and the U.S. Virgin Islands (17.7 degrees N, 64.6 degrees
   W; 27 m a.s.l.). Both the labile phase, representative of the
   anthropogenic signal, and the refractory detrital silicate fraction were
   analysed. Dust deposits and soils from around the sampling sites were
   measured as well to assess the potential contribution from local sources
   to the mineral dust collected. The contribution from anthropogenic
   sources of Pb was predominant in the labile, leachate phase. The overall
   similarity in Pb isotope signatures found in the leachates is attributed
   to a common African source of anthropogenic Pb, with minor inputs from
   other sources, such as from Central and South America, The Pb, Sr and Nd
   isotopic compositions in the silicate fraction were found to be
   systematically more radiogenic than those in the corresponding labile
   phases. In contrast, Nd and Sr isotopic compositions from Mali. Tobago,
   and the Virgin Islands are virtually identical in both leachates and
   residues. Comparison with existing literature data on Saharan and
   Sahelian sources constrains the origin of summer dust transported to the
   Caribbean to mainly originate from the Sahel region, with some
   contribution from northern Saharan sources. The source regions derived
   from the isotope data are consistent with 7-day back-trajectory
   analyses, demonstrating the usefulness of radiogenic isotopes in tracing
   dust provenance and atmospheric transport. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All

   desiccation rates, and diets of Sphaerodactylus vincenti on St. Vincent,
   West Indies. We predicted and observed high densities (to 5,625/ha) in
   moist, shaded leaf-litter. Such microhabitats provide refuges, access to
   prey, and protection against water loss, because S. vincenti is
   vulnerable to high desiccation rates. We found significant differences
   in masss-pecific water-loss rates and body mass between conspecific
   populations at differing elevations, with larger geckos less resistant
   to water loss living in more mesic environments at higher elevations.
   Stomach content analysis suggests that S. vincenti is a dietary
   generalist that feeds on a variety of small arthropods primarily by day.

AB Juveniles of four species of shallow water ophiuroids were captured in a
   plankton net tethered on the reef flat at Carrie Bow Gay, Belize:
   Ophiothrix orstedii, Ophiothrix angulata, Ophiocoma wendtii, and
   Ophiactis savignyi. These water-borne animals were similar in size to
   the smallest benthic conspecifics found on the reef, but considerably
   larger than newly metamorphosed postlarvae. Thus, this first report of
   planktonic dispersal by juvenile coral reef ophiuroids suggests that
   they reenter the plankton and drift, or perhaps raft on algal fragments,
   after first having recruited to the benthos. The occurrence of
   water-borne juveniles in species with planktotrophic and abbreviated
   larval development, and with clonal, asexual reproduction suggests that
   postlarval drifting may augment larval dispersal in some ophiuroid
   species and substitute for it in others.

AB Ecotoxicology has focused almost exclusively on countries and ecosystems
   in temperate zones. Tropical ecosystems, which combined contain as much
   as 75% of the global biodiversity, have been neglected. Tropical
   ecosystems are under increasing threat of development and habitat
   degradation from population growth and urbanization, agricultural
   expansion, deforestation, and mining. Some of these activities also lead
   to the release of toxic substances into the environment. Little research
   in ecotoxicology has been carried out in tropical environments.
   Techniques and procedures developed for temperate environments are often
   applied, even though physical and chemical environmental parameters in
   the tropics can be very different. Most research has focused on water
   quality and aquatic toxicology. The regulatory environment also varies
   among countries. We present a review of the literature on tropical
   ecotoxicology, with an emphasis on Latin America and the Caribbean. We
   also address priority areas for immediate research in the tropics. These
   include large-scale agricultural activities, especially banana,
   pineapple, and soybean farming, and gold mining with the associated
   heavy use of mercury. We outline the special issues that must be
   addressed as the field of tropical ecotoxicology progresses.

AB The fern flora of the Seychelles archipelago remains relatively poorly
   known. Recent projects involving the development of the Seychelles
   National Herbarium and study of key biodiversity areas have resulted in
   extensive explorations of the ferns on the granitic islands. Historical
   literature, newly collected specimens and older collections have been
   revised for the fern family Hymenophyllaceae as a prelude for a fern
   checklist, resulting in several discoveries. In Didymoglossum, specimens
   were found with a very unusual character: exsert sori. Revision of the
   specimens, including phylogenetic analyses, revealed that these belong
   to two distinct species: Didymoglossum beccarianum comb. nov. (until now
   only known from Southeast Asia) and a new species endemic to Seychelles,
   which is described as D. beaverianum below. The exact identity of the
   Southeast Asian species required to review a complex of species
   previously considered synonymous to D. motleyi. As a result, we propose
   a taxonomic hypothesis where Didymoglossum motleyi is in fact known from
   the type only (from Borneo); D. beccarianum includes the synonyms
   Trichomanes cognatum, T. sayeri and T. minutissimum and is widely
   distributed from Seychelles to the western Pacific Ocean and finally
   Didymoglossum (Trichomanes) cultratum comb. nov., which is maintained as
   a separate species (endemic to Fiji and known from the type only). We
   conclude by emphasizing the main diagnostic characters in this complex
   of species, including characters that have been neglected in the past.

AB The flora at Crater Mountain Biological Research Station in Papua New
   Guinea is very diverse: 228 tree species ( >= 10 cm DBH) on a single
   hectare. However, the vertebrate fauna (169 bird and 31 mammal species)
   is less diverse than many tropical sites. At least 47% of bird species
   and 29% of mammal species are partially frugivorous. Using data on
   relative abundance, mass, and degree of frugivory for all frugivorous
   vertebrates at Crater, we generated a crude "index of importance" for
   each species. Using the fruit size and mass data from 400 plant species,
   we exclude fruits either too large or too heavy for each frugivore to
   disperse, yielding a "possible diet" for each species. Four species (a
   cassowary, a hornbill, a fruit pigeon and a flying fox) stand out as
   being crucial dispersers for a large subset of the plant community. The
   frugivore with the highest importance ranking, Casuarius bennetti, is
   highly effective as a disperser. Cassowaries appear to be a keystone
   frugivore, especially for large-fruited plant species (67 species > 50 g
   at our study site). The method employed is fairly simple and quickly
   identifies candidates for keystone frugivore status. However, further
   life history studies are recommended for confirmation of importance when
   using this method.

   China, Germany, India, Kazakhstan, Japan, Papua New Guinea, Saudi
   Arabia, Singapore, and United States, facilitated through its
   translation into seven languages (English, Mandarin, Portuguese,
   Russian, Arabic, German, and Japanese). The article first discusses the
   survey methodology and then presents a discussion of the results
   according to four key components of energy security, namely
   availability, affordability, energy efficiency and stewardship. In
   addition to analyzing the survey results by different demographic and
   country levels, the authors compare the results to country-level data
   indicators. They find that energy security is a multi-dimensional
   concept with different priorities for different countries that can often
   be explained by the country's inherent circumstances.

AB Ciguatoxins (CTXs) are fish metabolism products and a result of
   biotransformation of precursor gambiertoxins produced, in the first
   instance, by benthic dinoflagellates Gambierdiscus and Fukuyoa.
   Ciguatoxins are potent neurotoxins that selectively open voltage gated
   sodium channels in excitable cells causing the human food poisoning
   known as Ciguatera (CFP). Endemic from tropical areas in central Pacific
   and West Indian Ocean, and the Caribbean Sea, CTX may affect up to
   500,000 people annually due to fish consumption. Their recent occurrence
   in European waters highlights the need for a multidisciplinary approach
   of CTX research in order to better understand the diversity and
   transformation of microalgae products through food webs. This article
   intends to review available information on chemistry, toxicity,
   distribution and fate of known CTX compounds from a critical perspective
   to provide an overview of future trends and needs on ciguatera research.

AB Neutrally buoyant particulate matter emitted from hydrothermal plumes in
   the eastern Manus Basin hydrothermal field, Papua New Guinea, was
   detected and sampled by CTD-transmissometer surveys during marine
   expeditions in 1991 and 1993. Characterization of suspended particulate
   matter has helped to prove that the main sources of venting are along a
   prominent 20-km-long NE-SW-striking felsic volcanic ridge. Elemental
   composition and particle morphology were determined by scanning electron
   microscopy and X-ray energy-dispersion spectroscopy. The size
   distribution and relative abundance of particles were determined by
   image analysis on selected samples. By looking at the composition of
   particulate matter, we can infer the origin, maturity and proximity of
   the source that is producing the particles. Seven types of particles
   have been morphologically and chemically characterized: i) filaments of
   probable biogenic origin of a Mn-Fe-Si phase containing traces of Cu and
   Zn, ii) orb-like particles of an Fe-Mn-Si phase containing minor Mg, Al,
   P, K and Ca, iii) barite, iv) anhydrite, v) colloidal-sized amorphous
   iron oxide, vi) an unidentified Si-Fe-rich phase, and vii) widespread
   biogenic detritus (shrimps, diatoms, silicoflagellates, copepods and
   unidentified gelatinous organic matter). Most of the particles are <2
   mum in sire and range from <2 <mu>m for amor amorphous iron oxide to 100
   mum for anhydrite and the Si-Fe-rich phase. Studies on suspended
   particulate matter constitute an effective way to recognize hydrothermal
   plumes.

AB Ciguatera Fish Poisoning is a worldwide concern caused by the
   consumption of fish contaminated with ciguatoxins not only in endemic
   regions in the Pacific Ocean or the Caribbean Sea but also in emerging
   areas of Macaronesia on the eastern Atlantic. The recent emergence of
   these toxins in other coastal areas worldwide, prompted the need for the
   characterization of the risk in these areas. This Ciguatera Fish
   Poisoning risk has been recently identified as a potential threat in
   subtropical areas of the Atlantic coast and scientific efforts are being
   focused in the identification and confirmation of the toxins involved in
   this potential risk. Neuroblastoma cell assay has been widely used for
   the evaluation of the toxicity in several marine biotoxin groups, and
   found to be a very useful tool for toxicity screening. LC-MS/MS has been
   also used for confirmatory purposes although the main limitation of the
   advances on LC-MS/MS development is due to commercial unavailability of
   reference materials and hampers method implementation and validation or
   even confirmation of the ciguatoxins (CTXs) responsible for the toxic
   profiles. While neuroblastoma cell assay (N2a) is typically used for
   toxicity screening as mentioned above, being necessary to confirm this
   N2a toxicity by LC-MS/MS, this study is designed using N2a as a tool to
   confirm the toxicity of the fractions obtained corresponding to
   potential CTXs analogues according to the analysis by LC-MS/MS. With
   this aim, an amberjack sample (Seriola fasciata) from Selvagen Islads
   (Portugal) and implicated in Ciguatera Fish Poisoning was analyzed by
   LC-MS/MS and Caribbean Ciguatoxins were found to be mainly responsible
   for the toxicity. N2a was used in this work as a tool to help in the
   confirmation of the toxicity of fractions obtained by HPLC. Caribbean
   Ciguatoxin-1 was found as the main analogue responsible for the N2a
   toxicity while three Caribbean Ciguatoxin-1 (C-CTX1) metabolites which
   contribute to the total toxicity were also identified.

   supercooled water are examined within updrafts in convective clouds in
   the Amazon and at Kwajalein, Marshall Islands, based on in situ
   measurements during two Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission field
   campaigns. Composite vertical profiles of liquid water, small particle
   concentration, and updraft/downdraft magnitudes exhibit similar peak
   values for the two tropical regions. Updrafts were found to be favored
   locations for precipitation embryos in the form of liquid or frozen
   drizzle-sized droplets. Most updrafts glaciated rapidly, removing most
   of the liquid water between -5degrees and -17degreesC. However,
   occasional encounters with liquid water occurred in much colder updraft
   regions. The updraft magnitudes where liquid water was observed at cold
   (e.g., -16degrees to -19degreesC) temperatures do not appear to be
   stronger than updrafts without liquid water at similar temperatures,
   however. The concentrations of small spherical frozen particles in
   glaciated regions without liquid water are approximately one-half of the
   concentrations in regions containing liquid cloud droplets, suggesting
   that a substantial portion of the cloud droplets may be freezing at
   relatively warm temperatures. Further evidence for a possible new type
   of aggregate ice particle, a chain aggregate found at cloud midlevels,
   is given.

AB Coral reefs are rich in biodiversity, in large part because their highly
   complex architecture provides shelter and resources for a wide range of
   organisms. Recent rapid declines in hard coral cover have occurred
   across the Caribbean region, but the concomitant consequences for reef
   architecture have not been quantified on a large scale to date. We
   provide, to our knowledge, the first region-wide analysis of changes in
   reef architectural complexity, using nearly 500 surveys across 200
   reefs, between 1969 and 2008. The architectural complexity of Caribbean
   reefs has declined nonlinearly with the near disappearance of the most
   complex reefs over the last 40 years. The flattening of Caribbean reefs
   was apparent by the early 1980s, followed by a period of stasis between
   1985 and 1998 and then a resumption of the decline in complexity to the
   present. Rates of loss are similar on shallow (<6 m), mid-water (6-20 m)
   and deep (>20 m) reefs and are consistent across all five subregions.
   The temporal pattern of declining architecture coincides with key events
   in recent Caribbean ecological history: the loss of structurally complex
   Acropora corals, the mass mortality of the grazing urchin Diadema
   antillarum and the 1998 El Nino Southern Oscillation-induced worldwide
   coral bleaching event. The consistently low estimates of current
   architectural complexity suggest regional-scale degradation and
   homogenization of reef structure. The widespread loss of architectural
   complexity is likely to have serious consequences for reef biodiversity,
   ecosystem functioning and associated environmental services.

AB The Atmospheric Radiation Measurement (ARM) program operates three
   climate observation stations in the tropical western Pacific region. One
   of these sites, located on Manus Island in Papua New Guinea, has been
   operating since 1996. The Manus ARM site includes an extensive array of
   instruments chosen to observe cloud properties, water vapor and
   temperature profiles, and the surface radiation budget. This dataset
   provides an opportunity to examine variability in tropical cloudiness on
   a wide range of time scales. The focus of this study is on the annual
   cycle. Analysis of cloud distribution and radiation data from Manus
   reveals a clear annual cycle in clouds associated with convective
   activity. The most convectively active period is found to be the
   Northern Hemisphere summer, while the least active period is the
   Northern Hemisphere autumn. Outgoing longwave radiation (OLR) data are
   also examined in order to relate observations at Manus with the
   surrounding region. Significant differences are found between the annual
   cycle at Manus and adjacent large islands within the Maritime Continent.
   Analysis of the combined ARM-OLR data suggests that during the Northern
   Hemisphere winter, a significant amount of the high clouds observed over
   Manus are associated with continental convection over the large Maritime
   Continent islands.

VL 29

BP 209
EP 221
PD JUL 1999
PY 1999
AB Changes in benthic foraminifer faunas throughout the late Neogene (about
   5.8-1.8 Ma) were analyzed in DSDP Hole 502A (Caribbean Sea) to determine
   whether the development of the Isthmus of Panama and resulting changes
   in bottom-water circulation affected the benthic foraminifer community.
   Benthic foraminifer accumulation rates (BFAR) of the 11 most abundant
   and presumably also ecologically significant species revealed three
   intervals of distinct faunal developments: Interval 1 (prior to 4.65 Ma)
   exhibits a fluctuating pattern in the benthic foraminifer fauna with an
   increase of Epistominella exigua between 5.7 and 5.35 Ma, except at
   about 5.4 Ma. This variation of E. exigua may indicate a period of
   increased vertical flux of organic (phytodetritial) matter to the
   seafloor at the base of the sequence. Also towards the upper part of
   Interval 1, E. exigua shows periods of higher abundance, which could be
   related to higher vertical flux of phytodetritus to the seafloor.
   Interval 2 (4.65 to 3.9 Ma) is marked by a gradual increase of C.
   wuellerstorfi and Oridorsalis umbonatus, and decrease of Nuttallides
   umbonifera with periods of higher abundance of E. exigua. This faunal
   change can be related to alternations of sudden phyto-detritus inputs
   and increased circulation within the Caribbean Sea that resulted from
   the progressive emergence of the Panamanian landbridge changing the
   Caribbean Sea from a broad oceanic seaway into a marginal sea. The
   restricted surface-water how over the Isthmus of Panama probably
   enhanced northward transport of warm, high-salinity waters into the high
   latitudes via the Gulf Stream and thus stimulated the total production
   of North Atlantic Deep Water (NADW) leading to an increased inflow of
   Upper North Atlantic Deep Water (UNADW) into the Caribbean Sea. The
   increased bottom-water activity in the Caribbean may have favored C.
   wuellerstorfi, which has been found to prefer an elevated suspension
   feeding position above the sediment surface. Intensified bottom-water
   circulation would allow more water to pass and thus provide more
   available food for this particular species. Interval 3 (about 3.9 to 1.8
   Ma) began with a striking decrease of C. wuellerstorfi coeval with a
   rapid increase of N. umbonifera, which became the dominating species.
   This may have been a response to a declined velocity of the bottom-water
   currents in the Caribbean, probably caused by less inflow of bottom
   waters from the North Atlantic. The organic flux into the area may have
   been similar to Interval 2, but lower bottom-water current velocities
   may have favored the more oligotrophic species N. umbonifera relative to
   C. wuellerstorfi. The peak abundance of E. exigua between about 3.55 and
   3.45, and at 3.4-3.35 Ma may be a result of strong but interrupted
   inputs of phyto-detritus into the Colombia Basin. Also in the upper part
   of the interval particularly between approximately 2.5 and 2.2 Ma the
   abundance of E. exigua exhibit increased values.
   At about 3.0 Ma N. umbonifera shows a drastic decrease and coeval
   recovery of C. wuellerstorfi, O. umbonatus, and Pyrgo murrhina. This
   faunal change could be attributable to (a) mixing between the base of
   nutrient-rich Antarctic Intermediate Water (AAIW) and the upper layer of
   Upper North Atlantic Deep Water (UNADW), and/or (b) nutrient-rich local
   river outflow (e.g. from the Rio Magdalena) together with, at least
   periodically, (9) increased bottom-water currents that favored the
   normally elevated and suspension feeding C. wuellerstorfi. The short
   term alternation in the benthic foraminifer abundance, i.e. the instant
   recovery of N. umbonifera in the lower part of the interval, may
   indicate an amelioration of deep-water conditions, which may have been
   associated with a slower inflow of bottom water into the Caribbean Sea.
   Moreover, the increased average benthic delta(13)C value during the
   upper part of Interval 3 may also be a result of a better bottom-water
   ventilation in the Colombia Basin linked to the onset of the modern
   deep-water circulation, which most likely is related to periodically
   increased inflow of UNADW into the Caribbean Sea.

AB This article analyses the nexus between the Caribbean's manifold
   vulnerabilities and the direct and structural violence evident
   throughout the region's history. It argues that Caribbean states are
   threatened not only by direct violence but also by the structural
   violence permeating in impoverished and marginalised sectors of the
   state-society complex. Both forms of violence are attributable to the
   historical legacy of colonisation, to US paternalism and hegemonic
   dominance in the post-colonial era, and to the persistence of the
   coloniality of power, even after Caribbean states won their independence
   from European imperial powers. Today, the region is, per capita, one of
   the most violent areas on the globe. Evidence of concatenated violence
   is growing across this region, demonstrating the difficulty small
   underdeveloped states have in addressing threats to their security,
   independence, economic viability, and continued existence in the
   intermestic environment within which they operate.

   surveys (1998-2002 and January 2004) (MXC). We found striking
   inshore-offshore differences in the larval catch and size structure.
   Offshore cruises yielded 57 leptocephali, mostly determined as early
   stage I (18.0 +/- A 8.2 mm SL, mean +/- A SD). In contrast, coastal
   samples yielded 2,466 larvae 51.4 +/- A 3.6 mm SL, mostly late stage I;
   of these, 2,345 (95%) were caught over 4 nights in January 2004. The
   relationship between the larval length (mm, SL) and the distance to the
   coastline (km) was best represented by the regression model with a
   distinct variance for each locality. To ascertain whether the coastal
   inflow of leptocephali follows a regular seasonal pattern or depends on
   episodic events will require further monitoring; available evidence
   suggests that the southern coast of the MXC offers favorable conditions
   for the recruitment of Albula spp. larvae.

AB The paper reports fish bone and shellfish assemblages from Ulong Island
   in the Rock Islands of Palau, western Micronesia dating from similar to
   3100 to 500 BP. Use of marine resources in early prehistory appears to
   have been highly localised with increasing capture of outer-reef/pelagic
   taxa including shark and tuna after 1000 BP. Local stocks of large
   Tridacnids were depleted during initial human use of Ulong Island, and
   there is a size decrease in Scarus sp. remains consistent with pressure
   on the inshore fishery, especially after establishment of permanent
   stonework villages in late prehistory. Comparison of archaeological
   assemblages of fish bone from other Rock Islands dated to after 2000 BP
   indicate that the captured fish species and major capture methods differ
   between sites and likely reflect local marine environments at each
   location. Copyright (c) 2010 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB Gauging the effect of C-14-depleted marine foods on radiocarbon ages
   requires an accurate assessment of the likely proportion of marine foods
   in the diet. Several factors must be considered, including
   region-specific delta C-13, delta N-15 and delta S-34 data values
   (regional stable isotope values can differ from global averages),
   temporal variations in delta C-13 which offset values in modern dietary
   standards by up to 1.5 parts per thousand, and that modelling which
   considers only delta C-13 may overestimate the contribution of various
   dietary sources. Here, we compare previous calculations by linear
   interpolation of delta C-13 and a complex computer simulation of marine
   contribution to the diet of inhumations from the SAC archaeological site
   Watom Island, Papua New Guinea, with the ISOSOURCE mixing model and a
   revised database of regional dietary sources and their isotopic values,
   to estimate marine diet contributions and radiocarbon offsets for
   burials from the SAC site. Though different estimates of marine
   contribution to diet do not significantly alter previous calibrations of
   radiocarbon ages for the inhumations, the new ISOSOURCE calculations
   challenge the idea of excessive exploitation of marine resources and
   support evidence for arboriculture and horticulture being a major
   component in Lapita diet.

AB The world today depends mainly on a few crop species to provide global
   food calories. Exploiting the large reservoir of minor and underutilized
   crop plants could provide a more diversified agricultural system and the
   food sources necessary to address food and nutritional security
   concerns. Winged bean (Psophocarpus tetragonolobus) is an underutilized
   food legume cultivated mainly in Asia and the Pacific. It is a
   multipurpose crop used as a vegetable, a pulse and for tubers. Each part
   of the plant is edible and each contains a different nutritional
   composition; leaves and pods, commonly used as a vegetable, are a rich
   source of vitamins, minerals and fiber, the seed are high in protein and
   the tuber provides a rich source of carbohydrate. The crop could provide
   a balanced diet to address dietary imbalances facing the world today.
   Like most underutilised crops, winged bean is at least partly
   constrained by the lack of improved cultivars and low productivity. The
   present study evaluated yields and yield-related attributes of 24
   contrasting winged bean accessions from Malaysia, Indonesia, Nigeria,
   Papua New Guinea, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka and Liberia. Significant
   differences (P<0.05) were observed between accessions for all the
   characters studied. Some accessions showed agronomic potential and could
   form the basis for selection of parents to be used in future breeding
   programmes. The abundances of foliar mineral nutrients were investigated
   for association with yield and yield-related characters to evaluate
   whether nutrient element levels could potentially be used as selection
   criteria for productivity. Improving winged bean productivity could
   enhance nutritional security and sustained livelihoods.

AB The Strickland River is the primary sediment source for the Fly River
   system, a large tropical river that ranks in the global top 20 for both
   water and sediment discharge. Over the past decade the Strickland
   sediment discharge has been gauged at many locations. Comprehensive
   studies are now underway to study the delivery, transport, and storage
   of sediment throughout this system. A key question regards the timing
   and rates of sediment accumulation on the flood plains. Here we present
   the first geochronological results from an intensive flood plain coring
   campaign conducted in 2003 outline our procedure for dating PNG sediment
   with Pb-210 geochronology, and summarize some early results from 36
   cores. Flood plain accumulation rates appear to be highest upstream near
   the gravel-sand transition, low in the middle portion of the river, and
   higher again in the lower reaches of the Strickland near to its
   confluence with the Fly River. Overall patterns of sedimentation seem to
   be both spatially consistent, for series of cores collected along single
   flood plain transects, and temporally uniform in the sense that the
   nature of accumulation (constant or episodic) has not generally changed
   over the century of record.

AB Symbioses profoundly affect the diversity of life, often through novel
   biochemical services that symbionts provide to their hosts. These
   biochemical services are typically nutritional enhancements and less
   commonly defensive, but rarely both simultaneously. On the coral reefs
   of Papua New Guinea, we discovered unique associations between marine
   isopod crustaceans (Santia spp.) and episymbiotic microbes. Transmission
   electron microscopy and pigment analyses show that episymbiont biomass
   is dominated by large (20-30 mu m) cyanobacterial cells. The isopods
   consume these photosymbionts and 'cultivate' them by inhabiting exposed
   sunlit substrates, a behaviour made possible by symbionts' production of
   a chemical defence that is repulsive to fishes. Molecular phylogenetic
   analyses demonstrated that the symbiotic microbial communities are
   diverse and probably dominated in terms of population size by bacteria
   and small unicellular Synechococcus-type cyanobacteria. Although largely
   unknown in the oceans, defensive symbioses probably promote marine
   biodiversity by allowing niche expansions into otherwise hostile
   environments.

AB During Ocean Drilling Program Legs 170 and 171A, logging-while-drilling
   (LWD) tools were deployed on the Costa Rica and Barbados subduction
   margins. High-quality density, resistivity, and natural gamma -ray logs
   were acquired across the decollement zones on both margins. Based on a
   new method of 'layer-by-layer' correlation of the logs, changes in
   thickness and volume between incoming and subducted or accreted
   sediments are determined with 15 in resolution and 1% accuracy. The
   change in sediment thickness and volume generally decreases with depth,
   however, this change strongly depends on the lithology. Siliceous layers
   such as diatomaceous and radiolarian clay tend to be fluid-bearing, and
   the stratigraphic position of such zones is a critical factor in the
   fate of the subducted sediment section. On the Costa Rica Margin, the
   sediment section on the Cocos plate is underthrust intact beneath the
   toe of the Caribbean Plate with no frontal offseraping where a siliceous
   fluid-bearing zone is present only in the upper part of the section. On
   the Barbados margin, a layer of radiolarian clay exists, providing a
   narrow zone of mechanical weakness and anomalously high dewatering in
   the middle of the sediment section. This layer divides the sediments
   that are subducted from those that are accreted. Accreted and subducted
   sediments show different compaction styles. Accreted sediments are
   characterized by rapid compaction with vertical thickening, whereas
   subducted sediments are characterized by slow compaction with vertical
   flattening. The vertical thickening of the accreted sediments is due to
   horizontal tectonic compaction and contributes to the vertical
   thickening of the accretionary prism as a whole in the early stages of
   deformation. Dewatering flux is calculated by the volume change of the
   sediment sequences across the trench. The dewatering flux computed from
   the LWD data provides an estimate of the minimum fluid flux in the
   subduction zone and is significantly greater than the flux estimated
   from laboratory experiments because of meter-scale fluid conduits which
   influence the downhole logs but not the centimeter-scale sample
   measurements. (C) 2001 Published by Elsevier Science B.V.

AB ABSTRACT Sponges (Porifera) are important constituents of littoral
   habitats in the Caribbean Sea. The knowledge of their biodiversity is
   fundamental to carry out ecological, managerial and utilitarian
   research. Their taxonomy is complex, but in the Caribbean in general,
   and in Colombia in particular, there are important advances. With this
   work, some sponge species of the genera Petrosia and Xestospongia are
   recorded and described for the first time from the Colombian Caribbean.
   Petrosia (Strongylophora) davilai, Xestospongia arenosa, Xestospongia
   deweerdtae and Xestospongia purpurea are described and illustrated. The
   number of records of Petrosia and Xestospongia for the Colombian
   Caribbean are now three and four species, respectively. In all species,
   the specimens from continental localities had larger spicule sizes than
   those from insular localities, apparently owing to a greater
   availability of dissolved silicon in the former. The existence in
   Xestospongia deweerdtae of free-living and Plafaortis-associated
   lifestyles was documented for new areas of the Caribbean.
X4 RESUMEN Las Esponjas (Porífera) son constituyentes muy importantes de
   los ambientes litorales del mar Caribe. El conocimiento de su diversidad
   es fundamental para desarrollar investigaciones ecológicas, de
   aprovechamiento y de manejo. Su taxonomía es compleja pero en el Caribe
   en general y en Colombia en particular se vienen haciendo avances
   importantes. En el presente trabajo se registran y describen por primera
   vez para el Caribe colombiano algunas especies de esponjas de los
   géneros Petrosia y Xestospongia. Se describen e ilustran Petrosia
   (Strongylophora) davilai, Xestospongia arenosa, Xestospongia deweerdtae
   y Xestospongia purpurea. Con ello, se llega a tres registros del género
   Petrosia y a cuatro del género Xestospongia para el Caribe colombiano.
   En todas las especies, los especímenes de localidades continentales
   tenían las espículas más grandes que los que se encontraban en
   localidades insulares, aparentemente por haber una mayor disponibilidad
   de silicio disuelto en las primeras. Se documentó para nuevas áreas del
   mar Caribe la existencia en Xestospongia deweerdtae de hábitos de vida
   libre y asociado a Plakortis.

   isotopic composition in precipitation and groundwater in the northern
   mountainous region of the Central Valley of Costa Rica. During the dry
   season, rainfall samples corresponded to enriched events with high
   deuterium excess. By mid-May, the Intertropical Convergence Zone poses
   over Costa Rica resulting in a depletion of O-18/O-16 and H-2/H ratios.
   A parsimonious four-variable regression model (r(2)=0.52) was able to
   predict daily O-18 in precipitation. Air mass back trajectories
   indicated a combination of Caribbean Sea and Pacific Ocean sources,
   which is clearly depicted in groundwater isoscape. Aquifers relying on
   Pacific-originated recharge exhibited a more depleted pattern, whereas
   recharge areas relying on Caribbean parental moisture showed an
   enrichment trend. These results can be used to enhance modelling efforts
   in Central America where scarcity of long-term data limits water
   resources management plans.

AB BACKGROUND: Vanilla x tahitensis produced in French Polynesia has a
   unique flavour among vanilla species. However, data on volatiles and
   sensory properties remain limited. In this study, the volatile
   composition and sensory properties of V. xtahitensis from three
   Polynesian cultivars and two origins (French Polynesia/Papua New Guinea)
   were determined by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry and quantitative
   descriptive analysis, respectively, and compared to Vanilla planifolia.
   RESULTS: Vanilla species, origins and cultivars were differentiated by
   their volatile and sensory profiles using principal component analysis.
   The V. xtahitensis flavour from French Polynesia was characterized by a
   well-balanced sensory profile, having strong anise and caramel notes due
   to high levels of anisyl compounds. V. xtahitensis from Papua New Guinea
   was distinct from that of French Polynesia, having strong spicy, fruity,
   brown rum notes due to p-vinylguaiacol, p-cresol and esters. Vanilla
   planifolia showed stronger phenolic, woody, smoky notes due to guaiacol,
   creosol and phenol, which were found to be biomarkers of the species.
   Vanilla sensory properties were linked by partial least squares
   regression to key volatile compounds like guaiacol or creosol, which are
   indicators of lower quality.
   CONCLUSION: This study brings new insights to vanilla quality control,
   with a focus on key volatile compounds, irrespective of origin. (C) 2015

AB Aquatic invasive species (AIS) are biological pollutants that cause
   detrimental ecological, economic, and human health effects in their
   introduced communities. With increasing globalization through maritime
   trade, ports are vulnerable to AIS exposure via commercial vessels. The
   Cuban Port of Mariel is poised to become a competitive transshipment hub
   in the Caribbean and the intent of this study was to evaluate present
   and potential impacts AIS pose with the likely future increase in
   shipping activity. We utilized previous assessment frameworks and
   publicly accessible information to rank MS by level of threat. Fifteen
   MS were identified in Cuba and one, the Asian green mussel Perna viridis
   (Linnaeus, 1758), had repeated harmful economic impacts. Five species
   associated with trade partners of Port Mariel were considered
   potentially detrimental to Cuba if introduced through shipping routes.
   The results presented herein identify species of concern and emphasize
   the importance of prioritizing MS prevention and management within Cuba.

   replaced nearly all South America's non-volant mammals. There is no
   geological evidence for a land bridge at that time. Together with
   rodents and primates crossing from Africa 42 to 30Ma, South America's
   mammals evolved in isolation until the interchange's first heralds less
   than 10Ma. Its carnivores were ineffective marsupials. Meanwhile, North
   America was invaded by more competitive Eurasian mammals. The Americas
   had comparable expanses of tropical forest 55Ma; later, climate change
   confined North American tropical forest to a far smaller area. When the
   isthmus formed, North American carnivores replaced their marsupial
   counterparts. Although invaders crossed in both directions, North
   American mammals spread widely, diversified greatly, and steadily
   replaced South American open-country counterparts, unused to effective
   predators. Invading South American mammals were less successful. South
   America's birds, bats, and smaller rainforest mammals, equally isolated,
   mostly survived invasion. Its vegetation, enriched by many overseas
   invaders, remained intact. This vegetation resists herbivory
   effectively. When climate permitted, South America's rainforest, with
   its bats, birds and mammals, spread to Mexico. Present-day tropical
   American vegetation is largely zoned by trade-offs between exploiting
   well-watered settings versus surviving droughts, exploiting fertile
   versus coping with poor soil, and exploiting lowland warmth versus
   coping with cooler altitudes. At the start of the Miocene, a common
   marine biota extended from Trinidad to Ecuador and western Mexico, which
   evolved in isolation from the Indo-Pacific until the Pleistocene. The
   seaway between the Americas began shoaling over 12Ma. About 10Ma the
   land bridge was briefly near-complete, allowing some interchange of land
   mammals between the continents. By 7Ma, the rising sill had split
   deeper-water populations. Sea temperature, salinity and sedimentary
   carbon content had begun to increase in the Southern Caribbean, but not
   the Pacific. By 4Ma, the seaway's narrowing began to extinguish
   Caribbean upwellings. By 2Ma, upwellings remained only along Venezuela;
   Caribbean plankton, suspension-feeding molluscs and their predators had
   declined sharply, largely replaced by bottom-dwelling corals and
   calcareous algae and magnificent coral reefs. Closing the seaway
   extinguished the Eastern Pacific's reef corals (successors recolonized
   from the Indo-Pacific 6000years ago), whereas many molluscs of
   productive waters that once thrived in the Caribbean now survive only in
   the Eastern Pacific. The present-day productive Eastern Pacific, with
   few, small coral reefs and a plankton-based ecosystem contrasts with the
   Caribbean, whose clear water favours expansive coral reefs and
   bottom-dwelling primary producers. These ecosystems reflect the
   trade-off between fast growth and effective defence with attendant
   longevity.
   Overfishing with new technologies during the last few centuries,
   however, has caused population crashes of ever-smaller marine animals,
   devastating Caribbean ecosystems.

AB Jellyfish blooms in pelagic systems appear to be increasing on a global
   scale because of anthropogenic impacts, but much less is known about the
   link between human activities and epibenthic jellyfish abundance. The
   aim of this study was to investigate whether the epibenthic jellyfish,
   Cassiopea spp., were found in greater abundance, and attained larger
   sizes, in coastal habitats adjacent to high human population densities
   compared to sites adjacent to uninhabited areas on Abaco Island,
   Bahamas. Cassiopea spp. were found to be significantly more dense and
   larger in areas with high human population densities. Ambient nutrient
   levels and nutrient content of seagrass were elevated in high human
   population density sites, and may be one mechanism driving higher
   abundance and size of Cassiopea spp. Cassiopea spp. may have important
   effects on community structure and ecosystem function in critical
   coastal ecosystems (e.g., seagrass beds), and their impacts warrant
   further study. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB AimUsing the Acalyphoideae, we explore the origin and diversification of
   the Caribbean flora. This lineage of flowering plants constitutes an
   important component of the flora of the Caribbean islands with many
   endemics. Furthermore, because it is also diverse in adjacent Mexico,
   Mesoamerica and South America, it allows a representative analysis of
   possible migration routes into the Caribbean.
   LocationNeotropics, Cuba, Hispaniola and the Caribbean region, Mexico
   and Mesoamerica.
   MethodsWe generated a well-resolved and dated phylogenetic hypothesis
   based on a dense sampling, in particular of the New World taxa but also
   representing all remaining Acalyphoideae, and combined datasets of
   chloroplast spacers and introns. Bayesian divergence-time estimation was
   applied to determine node ages. Ancestral states of distributional areas
   were reconstructed in a Bayesian framework to determine the geographical
   origin of the Caribbean ancestors.
   ResultsA Neotropical clade started to diversify 59.29 [50.41-68.44 95%
   highest posterior density (HPD)] Ma within the Acalyphoideae. The
   Caribbean islands then were reached several times independently from the
   Miocene onwards. The exclusively Caribbean
   Leucocroton-Lasiocroton-Garciadelia [9.1 (6.3-12.3 95% HPD) Ma] and
   Acidoton-Platygyna [9.3 (5.2-15.4 95% HPD) Ma] clades exhibit one of the
   most successful plant radiations in the region, and Caribbean subclades
   of Acalypha and Bernardia just date back to the Pliocene and
   Pleistocene, respectively.
   Main conclusionsOur data show that Mexico and Mesoamerica have played a
   key role as a source for today's Caribbean Acalyphoideae. Their
   ancestors arrived from the mainland to the Caribbean islands during the
   Miocene when Caribbean land masses were completely separated and then
   diversified insitu. We postulate long-distance dispersal to have played
   a major role for colonizing the Caribbean.

AB This article utilizes a combination of the masculinity and
   intersectionality frameworks to argue that the underachievement of boys
   occurs in the intricacies of patriarchy, region (rural area), and class
   culture. The article utilizes data drawn from a qualitative study at two
   rural institutions in the parish of Manchester, Jamaica, to critically
   analyze the gendered nexus between boys' underachievement and
   educational policies. The low grades merited by boys raise questions of
   patriarchy in the educational system in which they and their female
   teachers operate. While the failure of boys is not generalizable to the
   entire population, underachievement is also located in the mismatch
   between curriculum and the culture of these boys.

AB Small island developing states (SIDS) face a serious issue of
   sustainability as far as waste management within the industrial sector
   is concerned. This paper makes an attempt at addressing the eventual
   practice of industrial ecology in SIDS with Mauritius as a case study.
   Three major polluting industries namely the slaughterhouse, edible oil
   refinery and the scrap metal recycling plant have been considered with a
   particular focus on the recycling of electric arc furnace slag as
   concrete aggregates. Along with the potential areas of applications for
   the different waste materials, this research has also addressed the
   benefits, barriers and factors for implementing industrial symbiosis
   projects within SIDS. The most striking benefits are the preservation of
   the fauna and flora of the island and reduced dependency on developed
   countries for the importation of raw materials while the absence of a
   landfill disposal fee for non-hazardous wastes and lack of awareness of
   industrial symbiosis projects have been identified as the main barriers.
   To overcome these barriers, a shift from manufacture-consume-dispose to
   manufacture consume-recycle-manufacture is recommended. This study
   concludes that if a sustainable island is anticipated in the future, a
   combination of recycling options along with all necessary factors such
   as technology, funding from international organisations, regulatory
   framework and involvement of stakeholders, general public and
   non-governmental organisations is required. Ultimately, this would
   result in the establishment of networks among source and sink
   industries, thus being in harmony with the environment. (C) 2017

AB Purpose - The differentiation that takes place in the Trinidad market
   only classifies tomatoes on the basis of its size. Farmers in many
   countries have been making an effort at agronomic differentiation
   strategies in order to receive better incomes. The purpose of this paper
   is to determine Trinidadian consumers' willingness to pay (WTP) and the
   market potential for organic tomatoes when marketed as a differentiated
   product.
   Design/methodology/approach - A survey research methodology was used in
   this study. A total of 405 consumers to be surveyed were randomly chosen
   using proportionate sampling. A logistic regression was used to estimate
   the factors affecting consumers' WTP for organic tomatoes. An ANOVA
   model was used to determine the mean maximum WTP for organic tomatoes
   based on selected factors.
   Findings - Most consumers were willing to pay premium prices for organic
   tomatoes. Results indicated that consumers' area of residence,
   educational level, income range, and their perception of the health
   benefits derived from organic tomatoes significantly influenced their
   WTP for organic tomatoes.
   Research limitations/implications - Empirical results suggests a
   differentiated organic market should be implemented in Trinidad.
   Originality/value - Given an informed consumer base, farmers can expect
   to receive a premium price for their produce. Consumers can benefit from
   having more choices in the agricultural market.

AB Extant estuarine and freshwater animals show a variety of adaptations to
   marine life, which could reflect transitional stages in a gradual
   evolution from freshwater to the sea. Our aim was to identify the
   temporal and spatial environment associated with pig-nosed turtles
   Carettochelys insculpta coastal nesting in the Kikori Region, Papua New
   Guinea (PNG). We also related the use of coastal areas with size within
   and among different populations of C.insculpta and species of the
   superfamily Trionychoidea. Throughout its range, C.insculpta nests
   during the drier months when suitable sandbanks are exposed. In PNG,
   rainfall in the drier season dilutes salinities and C.insculpta nests in
   coastal sandbanks. In Australia, high salinities prevail in the river
   mouths during the nesting season and no coastal use is observed. Trends
   toward a larger body size in coastal areas suggest that size is an
   important factor to explore coastal environments. It is unlikely that
   female C.insculpta with less than 50cm (curve carapace length) would be
   able to cope with the Kikori coastal environment. Expanding this trend
   to its superfamily Trionychoidea, only species larger than 37cm
   (leathery carapace length) explore coastal environments. As the
   Australian coast is not suitable for nesting, the selection for larger
   body sizes was probably relieved. Of course, the reverse could be true,
   but our study provides an example of the caution required when placing
   evolutionary interpretations on life-history traits whose manifestation
   is studied only within a restricted portion of a species range.
