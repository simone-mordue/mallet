AB Gnathiid isopod larvae constituted the majority of countable food items
   taken by broadstripe gobies, Elacatinus prochilos, on Barbadian coral
   reefs, which confirms their important role in cleaning interactions.
   However, E. prochilos does not rely exclusively on cleaning for food
   since a large amount of benthic material, mainly sponge and coral
   polyps, was observed in the stomach contents of all cleaners. Less than
   one-third of cleaners had ingested ectoparasites. Elacatinus prochilos
   appears to consume few ectoparasites compared with other Elacatinus
   species elsewhere in the Caribbean and with Indo-Pacific cleaner
   species. (C) 2000 The Fisheries Society of the British Isles.

AB Background. Skin lightening is very popular among women and some men of
   the Caribbean, and its popularity appears to be growing. The lightening
   of skin colour is done to produce a lighter complexion which is believed
   to increase attractiveness, social standing and improves one's potential
   of being successful.
   Design and Methods. Fifteen (15) common skin lightening creams found in
   pharmacies and cosmetic retailers throughout Trinidad and Tobago were
   evaluated for Mercury by Cold Vapor Atomic Absorption Spectrophotometry
   (CVAAS) and Arsenic by Hydride Generation Atomic Absorption
   Spectrophotometry (HGAAS). The results obtained were compared to global
   standards and previous research.
   Results. Fourteen (14) of the fifteen samples analysed contained Mercury
   in the range of 0.473 mu g/g to 0.766 mu g/g. One sample had a Mercury
   content of 14,507.74 +/- 490.75 mu g/g which was over 14,000 times
   higher than the USFDA limit for mercury in cosmetics of 1 mu g/g. All
   samples contained Arsenic in the range 1.016 mu g/g to 6.612 mu g/g,
   which exceeds the EU limit for cosmetics of 0 mu g/g.
   Conclusions. All the samples analysed contained significant amounts of
   Mercury and Arsenic and none of them can be considered safe for
   prolonged human use. The samples that contained Mercury levels which
   were lower than the USFDA limit contained Arsenic levels which exceeded
   the EU standard of 0 mu g/g in cosmetics. The popularity of these skin
   lightening creams in the Caribbean region places the population at
   elevated risk of chronic Mercury and Arsenic poisoning and possibly
   acute Mercury Poisoning.

AB Marine ecosystems play a central role in economic and social life in the
   Republic of Palau, a Small Island Developing State in the Western
   Pacific. Marine resources underpin subsistence and commercial fisheries,
   as well as tourism activities, contributing substantially to Palau's GDP
   and employment. Since 1992, Palau has been actively developing
   conservation initiatives to protect marine resources, promote
   ecotourism, and ensure revenue generation. Marine reserves represent a
   particularly important tool in the country's sustainable development
   strategy. In 2015, Palau designated 80% of its marine EEZ as a National
   Marine Sanctuary, with the remaining 20% slated for domestic fisheries.
   That same year, Palau received 160 thousand tourists, over 9 times the
   country's population. In early 2017, the President proposed a bill
   effectively limiting budget travel and actively promoting high-end
   tourism. This study uses a quantitative social-ecological model to
   explore policy scenarios involving tourism, marine conservation and
   local food security. While climate change had the largest expected
   impact on local ecosystems, reef fish consumption contributes
   considerably to future projected declines in marine resources.
   Therefore, for Palau to achieve its goals of boosting revenues while
   sustainably stewarding marine resources, it will be necessary to
   transfer some level of consumption from reef fish on to tuna and other
   pelagics. Such changes, which align with the current proposal of
   developing an offshore national fishery as part of the Sanctuary's
   management plan, may allow Palau to meet future seafood demand, while
   protecting reef systems and the industries that rely on them.

AB Since the mass mortality of Diadema antillarum Philippi, 1845
   populations in 1983-1984, recovery has been slow and D. antillarum
   remain scarce at many localities across the Caribbean Sea. Yet, in 2014
   we observed high densities of D. antillarum over relatively large areas
   of shallow nearshore coral reefs in Grand Anse Bay, Grenada. The present
   study sought to assess D. antillarum populations at two high-density
   sites in Grand Anse Bay during 2014-2015 to determine the status of D.
   antillarum populations on those reefs. Mean D. antillarum densities at
   the two sites surveyed in Grenada were relatively high [5.9 (SE 0.57)
   and 12.5 (SE 0.74) individuals m(-2)] compared with the average density
   (4.5 individuals m(-2)) of D. antillarum from a previous study in Grand
   Anse Bay. The majority of individuals identified at the two sites were
   small (9-39 mm) to medium size (40-59 mm) sea urchins. Mean density of
   juvenile D. antillarum (<20 mm) at site 1 was significantly greater
   during a nighttime survey compared with a daytime survey, suggesting
   that daytime surveys may have been underestimating abundance of juvenile
   D. antillarum on those reefs. The high density of small to medium size
   sea urchins, as well as the presence of several juveniles observed at
   night, suggests that the high D. antillarum densities found at these two
   sites in Grenada were unlikely to be limited by fertilization success,
   larval production, and/or larval survivorship.

AB Invasion of the land has been a considerable challenge for aquatic
   organismal lineages, primarily because of desiccation and lack of
   physical support in air. Gastropod molluscs are among the most
   successful animals in this habitat shift because of their hard
   exoskeleton, whereas land slugs, regarded as descendants of land snails,
   gradually lost their shells in sheltered, moist environments. We present
   solid evidence of terrestrial invasion by a lineage of sea slugs; this
   invasion is represented by a newly discovered species, Aiteng
   marefugitus (Panpulmonata: Acochlidia), from a humid tropical rainforest
   on a small island in the Republic of Palau, western Pacific. The slug
   lineage seems to have invaded the forest habitat directly from the upper
   littoral zone in the Cenozoic.

AB The Indo-Pacific lionfish, Pterois miles and P. volitans, have recently
   invaded the U.S. east coast and the Caribbean and pose a significant
   threat to native reef fish communities. Few studies have documented
   reproduction in pteroines from the Indo-Pacific. This study provides a
   description of oogenesis and spawn formation in P. miles and P. volitans
   collected from offshore waters of North Carolina, U.S.A and the Bahamas.
   Using histological and laboratory observations, we found no differences
   in reproductive biology between P. miles and P. volitans. These lionfish
   spawn buoyant eggs that are encased in a hollow mass of mucus produced
   by specialized secretory cells of the ovarian wall complex. Oocytes
   develop on highly vascularized peduncles with all oocyte stages present
   in the ovary of spawning females and the most mature oocytes placed
   terminally, near the ovarian lumen. Given these ovarian characteristics,
   these lionfish are asynchronous, indeterminate batch spawners and are
   thus capable of sustained reproduction throughout the year when
   conditions are suitable. This mode of reproduction could have
   contributed to the recent and rapid establishment of these lionfish in
   the northwestern Atlantic and Caribbean.

AB The tri-island state of Grenada, Carriacou, and Petit Martinique's
   legislative and institutional compliance with the World Organisation for
   Animal Health's (OIE) guidelines on antimicrobial utilisation in poultry
   production is reviewed in this paper. This includes legislative and
   other institutional documents, coupled with interviews with veterinary
   officers, health officers and managers of the veterinary drug
   distribution centres were conducted to evaluate the extent of Grenada's
   compliance with the OIE's Terrestrial Animal Health Code in the use of
   antimicrobials in poultry production. Five thematic areas were
   evaluated: 1) legislative and institutional arrangements; 2)
   surveillance and reporting; 3) risks associated with the importation of
   poultry meat products; 4) ante-and post-mortem inspection; and 5)
   procurement and use of antimicrobials. The information revealed that the
   current legislative framework in Grenada does not adequately address
   poultry food safety and that there is a need to strengthen the synergies
   between the agricultural and health sectors to enable a more thorough
   monitoring of antimicrobials use in poultry production. There is a need
   to strengthen epidemiology of zoonotic diseases, provisioning of
   education and information for key stakeholders about the use of
   antibiotics and the development of a system to monitor antibiotic
   procurement, distribution and use in Grenada. These findings have
   implications for other small island states in the Caribbean that have
   similar limitations in institutional capacity and knowledge deficits in
   the prudent use of antibiotics.

   intensity between 6.7 and 3 ka BP in agreement with records from Lake
   Miragoane, Haiti [Hodell et al., 1991. Reconstruction of the Caribbean
   climate change over the past 10,500 years. Nature 352, 790-793], mainly
   reflecting the insolation maximum of the Northern Hemisphere. Both the
   lake record and the stable isotope record of the stalagmite reveal
   additional centennial variability of recharge. High oxygen isotope
   values in stalagmite calcite, corresponding to reduced recharge, are
   synchronous with periods of lower stable isotope values recorded in Lake
   Miragoane ostracods, previously attributed to enhanced precipitation.
   Accordingly, periods of increased recharge in Barbados correspond to
   (18)O-enriched isotope values of ostracods, which were attributed to
   higher evaporation/precipitation ratios in the lakes. We ascribe this
   apparent discrepancy to changes in seasonality, i.e., winter periods of
   reduced temperature and relative humidity following summer months of
   increased precipitation. At present, such climate conditions occur
   during periods of enhanced Northern Atlantic Oscillation (NAO(+)). If
   enhanced seasonality is a consequence of a NAO(+) situation, the
   apparent discrepancy of high isotope values in lakes (previously
   attributed to droughts) can be reconciled with lower winter temperatures
   in the takes. Further, the correlation of solar intensity (derived from
   (14)C and (10)Be) with the isotopic signals recorded in the lacustrine
   sediments suggests a solar forcing of the NAO during the mid Holocene.

AB In the international climate change negotiations, the Small Island
   Developing States (SIDS) have emerged as a credible group through the
   AOSIS (Alliance of Small Island States) and have called for a global
   temperature rise of 1.5 degrees C above preindustrial levels. Whatever
   the outcomes of the negotiations, they are exacerbated by climate change
   and a rising sea level. Many share common characteristics of small size,
   high population density, limited land resources, vulnerability to
   natural hazards, threatened biodiversity, high dependence on tourism,
   and limited funds and human resources. The suggestions put forward for a
   research agenda for the SIDS include a comprehensive assessment of the
   SIDS as a group, a focused attention on oceans, increased development on
   renewable energy, inclusion of climate adaptation under natural disaster
   reduction, a strategy of 'save some islands rather than not to have any'

AB What is the cost of living in the Papua New Guinea highlands? An answer
   is sought using a time and energy accounting approach. The subsistence
   regime of Wola-speaking highlanders, the subjects of this investigation,
   comprises three components. The principal one is horticulture: people
   clearing gardens from forest and grassland, with tuberous crops
   predominating, notably sweet potato. The second component comprises
   animal rearing, notably of domestic pigs. The third, and least
   important, is hunting and gathering for food in the forest. The
   calculated returns on investments in these subsistence domains vary
   considerably. Gardens return in their crops between ten and fifteen
   times the energy expended in cultivation. Pigs may also give a good
   return, of four to five times the energy invested in rearing them, if
   slaughtered when adult, but people regularly keep animals for years and
   may incur negative energy returns on their labour investments. This
   relates to the high cultural premium put on pigs. Foraging for food is
   also energetically costly, the Wola expending four times more energy on
   these activities than they gain in return from the food they secure.
   This analysis of energy gains and losses challenges the relative notion
   of affluence as applied to foragers, by reviewing it in the comparative
   context of subsistence horticulture.

AB Many suggest that cancer and other diseases in Micronesia have been
   caused by nuclear testing in the Pacific. The 50-year commemoration of
   the March 1, 1954 Bravo thermonuclear test has rekindled interest in
   this area. This paper explores the documentation for, and the
   plausibility of, claims for disease causation by nuclear testing. Given
   the sheer volume of testing that the US conducted in the Pacific, it
   appears plausible that excess cancer would have occurred in areas of
   Micronesia other than the Marshall Islands. An excess of birth
   abnormalities in the Marshall Islands has been documented. While
   diabetes is not a radiogenic disease, and other cancers are generally
   less radiogenic than leukemia or thyroid cancer, the social and cultural
   effects of nuclear testing specifically, and the strategic uses to which
   Micronesia has been put generally, have had roles in the social
   production of disease. Integration into a globalized, cosmopolitan
   economy-with attendant phenomena such as the importation of tobacco,
   alcohol, foods of poor nutritional value, and new cultural mores-are
   also factors.

   from four specimens from four widely separate western Atlantic
   localities (Little Bahama Bank; off southwestern Florida; Tobago Island;
   and northeastern Colombia) from depths ranging from 62 to 138 m. The
   species is distinct from all other western Atlantic species currently
   assigned to the genus Chriolepis in having a fully scaled body, the
   first two dorsal-fin spines greatly elongated in both sexes, especially
   so in females, and two anal-fin pterygiophores inserted anterior to the
   first haemal spine. It differs from members of the similar genus Varicus
   in having branched pelvic-fins rays, a longer fifth pelvic-fin ray and
   more numerous meristic elements. It closely resembles Chriolepis
   atrimelum, known from a similar depth at Isla del Coco in the eastern
   Pacific Ocean.

AB In late 2001 a category 3 cyclone impacted forest plots that were
   established in Tonga in 1995, and additionally, one plot was
   accidentally burned by an escaped land-clearing fire. Subsequent surveys
   provide observations of 10 years of forest dynamics in this poorly
   studied region, and the first reported observations of large interannual
   variation in juvenile (seedling and sapling) abundance in the western
   tropical Pacific. The severely disturbed (burned) plot was initially
   colonized by a non-native early pioneer, Carica papaya L., but 3.5 years
   later a native pioneer, Macaranga harveyana (Muell. Arg.) Muell. Arg.,
   was the most abundant tree species. The seedling layer included some
   long-lived pioneers and shade-tolerant species. Two mature forest plots
   affected only by the cyclone changed very little over a decade.
   Late-successional shade-tolerant species that dominated the overstory
   were also abundant as seedlings and saplings. This is in contrast with a
   30- to 40-year-old, formerly cultivated, secondary forest plot that
   still shows no recruitment of late-successional dominants, in spite of
   the proximity of remnant forest patches. This study suggests differing
   pathways of succession following shifting cultivation versus cyclone and
   fire disturbances in Tonga. Land use legacies appear to have a
   long-lasting effect on community composition.

AB Palolo worms (Palola, Eunicidae) are best known for their annual mass
   spawnings, or "risings," in the South Pacific. Palola currently contains
   14 morphologically similar species, mostly from shallow tropical waters.
   In this study, 60 specimens of Palola from nine locations in the
   tropical North Pacific and the Caribbean were sequenced for the two
   mitochondrial markers cytochrome c oxidase subunit I and 16S ribosomal
   RNA to infer phylogenetic relationships, genetic diversity, and
   phylogeography within the taxon. Phylogenetic analysis was performed
   using Bayesian statistics and parsimony. Vouchers of the same specimens
   were examined morphologically. Two major clades (A and B) can be
   distinguished within the monophyletic Palola. A number of individuals in
   clade B bear rows of ventral eyespots in the posterior body region,
   typical for swarming P. viridis and probably a synapomorphy for clade B.
   No morphological synapomorphy was found for clade A. Haplotypes from
   divergent clades often co-occur in the same location. Some haplotypes
   are geographically widespread, in one case covering the entire east-west
   expansion of the tropical Pacific. These result simply that despite the
   apparent absence of teleplanic larvae in eunicid polychaetes,
   long-distance dispersal is possible in at least some lineages of Palola.

AB Three copepod associates are reported from shallow-water ophiuroids at

   Ophiopsyllus latus, new species, and Ophiopsyllus reductus. The third is
   a pseudanthessiid poecilostomatoid, Pseudanthessius deficiens. The last
   species, previously known from Ophioderma cinereum, was also found on
   Ophioderma brevispinum. In contrast, species of Ophiopsyllus appear be
   to host-specific. Ophiopsyllus reductus is found exclusively on
   Ophiocoma echinata. Ophiopsyllus latus is found only on Ophiocomella
   ophiactoides (with the exception of two doubtful records from Ophiocoma
   pumila). Previous records of Ophiopsyllus reductus on Ophiocomella
   ophiactoides are incorrect. Comparisons between Jamaican and Belizean
   populations of Ophiopsyllus latus reveal similarities and differences
   and suggest that the parasitic effects of the species are minimal. On
   approximately 17-57% of O. ophiactoides examined there are 1-4 O. latus,
   which generally clasp the first or second arm joint near the edge of the
   disk. They face toward the mouth of the host, possibly orienting to the
   currents emanating from the bursae or to food in the oral region. In
   Belize, only one instance of physical injury to the host was noted,
   although parasitic damage has been reported in Jamaica. Furthermore, a
   published report that O. latus inhibits the sexual reproduction of the
   host appears to be unwarranted.

AB This study of hurricanes passing through the Caribbean in the 1950-2005
   period reveals that seasons with more intense hurricanes occur with the
   onset of Pacific La Nina events and when Atlantic SSTs west of Africa
   are above normal. Composites of NCEP reanalysis fields with regard to
   Caribbean hurricanes reveal development of an anomalous equatorial
   Atlantic zonal overturning circulation (upper easterly/lower westerly)
   that shifts toward the Caribbean coincident with a westward spread of
   the cold tongue in the east Pacific. Ocean atmosphere coupling is
   promoted through interaction of the southern Hadley cell and the
   Atlantic ITCZ. A heat budget analysis suggests that evaporation governs
   SSTs in the major development region (MDR) and near Venezuela, but the
   signal is weak prior to May. Using the knowledge gained, statistical
   algorithms are developed to predict Caribbean hurricanes at seasonal
   lead times. These make use of equatorial Pacific SST, subtropical
   Atlantic SST, and the zonal Walker cell over the Atlantic.

AB A one-dimensional quasi-Eulerian model, describing the biological and
   chemical interactions of autotrophic and heterotrophic plankton
   populations within the upper 100m of the water column, was used to
   explain the relative impact of iron fertilization from Saharan dust on
   phosphorus cycling by the cyanobacterium, Trichodesmium spp. We examined
   the Caribbean surface waters off the west coast of Barbados using
   seasonal cases of dust delivery (summer peak) in relation to periods of
   elevated phosphorus stocks found in episodic pulses of Amazon River
   water advected past Barbados by the Guiana Current. The additional iron
   and phosphorus supplied by fluvial sources, available after biological
   depletion of nitrogen, could alleviate the growth limitation of
   Trichodesmium far downstream of the river plumes. The model results were
   compared with measurements made of Trichodesmium stocks 8km off the west
   coast of Barbados. Modeled concentrations within the low-salinity Amazon
   plumes reached similar to 7.4mg chl m(-2), as seen at Barbados. In the
   absence of the low-salinity signal, the Trichodesmium biomass shifted to
   phosphorus limitation with little response to iron fertilization. This
   indicates that Trichodesmium stocks may indeed be mainly a function of
   phosphorus availability within the upper water column. Therefore, the
   supply of phosphorus from subtropical/tropical rivers, such as the
   Amazon and Orinoco, limits the potential cyanophyte response, despite
   adequate atmospheric iron delivery. This alters our view not only of the
   western North Atlantic nitrogen budget, but potentially several regions
   downstream of low N:P river systems. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

AB The fruit of pandanus (Pandanus tectorius) and garlic pear (Crataeva
   speciosa) are important indigenous Micronesian atoll foods, but are
   increasingly neglected due to dietary and lifestyle changes. Previous
   studies have shown considerable differences in carotenoid concentrations
   in some pandanus cultivars. There are many Micronesian pandanus
   cultivars, most of which have not been assessed. Carotenoid-rich foods
   protect against vitamin A deficiency, anemia, and chronic disease,
   including cancer, heart disease and diabetes, which are serious problems
   in Micronesia. Eleven pandanus cultivars of Mwoakilloa and
   Kapingamarangi Atolls, Pohnpei, Federated States of Micronesia (FSM)
   (assessed for the first time), dried pandanus paste of the Marshall
   Islands, and garlic pear of Mortlock Atolls, Chuuk, FSM, were analyzed
   for carotenoids (beta- and alpha-carotene, beta-cryptoxanthin, lutein,
   zeaxanthin, and lycopene). Pandanus paste was assessed for 11 vitamins.
   The pandanus cultivars contained substantial concentrations of
   provitamin A carotenoids (110-370 mu g beta-carotene/100g) and total
   carotenoids (990-5200 mu g/100 g). Pandanus paste contained 1400 mu g
   beta-carotene/100 g, 5620 mu g total carotenoids/100 g, and 10 vitamins
   (including 10.8 mg/100g vitamin C). Garlic pear contained 1070 mu g
   beta-carotene/100g and 1460 mu g total carotenoids/100 g. These
   cultivars and foods should be promoted in Micronesia and possibly
   elsewhere in the Pacific and other contexts in order to reduce vitamin A
   deficiency and provide further health benefits and enjoyment. (C) 2009

AB The worldwide decline in coral cover has serious implications for the
   health of coral reefs. But what is the future of reef fish assemblages?
   Marine reserves can protect fish from exploitation, but do they protect
   fish biodiversity in degrading environments? The answer appears to be
   no, as indicated by our 8-year study in Papua New Guinea. A devastating
   decline in coral cover caused a parallel decline in fish biodiversity,
   both in marine reserves and in areas open to fishing. Over 75% of reef
   fish species declined in abundance, and 50% declined to less than half
   of their original numbers. The greater the dependence species have on
   living coral as juvenile recruitment sites, the greater the observed
   decline in abundance. Several rare coral-specialists became locally
   extinct. We suggest that fish biodiversity is threatened wherever
   permanent reef degradation occurs and warn that marine reserves will not
   always be sufficient to ensure their survival.

AB Protein deficiency has in the past generally been considered the main
   nutritional problem in the world. This has unduly detracted attention
   from the need for an adequate energy intake. Using surveys from
   different areas in Papua New Guinea, it is shown that deteiled
   investigations are needed to determine actual nutritional needs. In the
   Sepik a severe energy deficiency was found to be the principal problem.
   In some Highland areas, on the other hand, a distinct protein deficiency
   was observed, compounded by a low energy intake in the under 5-years age
   group. These distinct dietary patterns require a vastly different
   approach to nutrition intervention. It is shown that nutritional needs
   in the Sepik could in principle be met by increasing the availability of
   staple foods. An emphasis on protein would be a misdirected effort for
   most areas there. In the Highlands emphasis should be placed on legumes
   particularly those with a high energy value. This could close the
   protein gap and help to meet the caloric needs of young children.

AB Phytoplankton are important primary producers in tropical coastal
   lagoons, with a critical role in sustaining food webs. However, most
   studies conducted in tropical systems with high anthropogenic influence
   have focused only on biomass. Water samples were collected, for
   phytoplankton (pigments and microscopy) and other environmental
   parameters, from two mangrove lagoons in Sao Tome Island. The highest
   nutrient concentrations were observed in the mangrove of Praia das
   Conchas, indicating stronger nutrient inputs in this catchment area.
   Bottom oxygen deficiency was observed in the mangrove of Malanza, which
   is likely to be associated with the existence of a bridge that
   constrains the water exchange with the sea. Pigment analyses showed that
   overall chlorophyll a concentrations were low, indicating low
   phytoplankton biomass. The highest values were found at Praia das
   Conchas. It is suggested that chlorophyll a can be used as an indicator
   of anthropogenic pressure in this tropical system. Microscopy reveales
   the presence of Dinophysis sp. and Ostreopsis sp. cells, which can be
   harmful even at low densities. Water quality could be improved by
   enhancing oxygen condition in Malanza and by monitoring the occurrence
   of algal blooms, with potential benefits for public health and tourism.

AB A robust marine radiocarbon (C-14) reservoir correction (Delta R) is
   essential for calibrating C-14 dates of marine mollusks and fish bones
   routinely found in archaeological sites as discarded food remains and
   bones of terrestrial animals (including humans) with an appreciable
   marine diet. New Delta R values are reported for the atoll archipelago
   of the Marshall Islands, eastern Micronesia. Atolls consist of
   biogenetic material-mostly coral and foraminifera-that can be directly
   dated for establishing sequences of atoll emergence and islet
   development. After sectioning and examination using scanning electron
   microscopy (SEM) to screen for sample diagenesis, 6 pristine branch
   coral samples were selected from the modern oceanside beach, 3
   archaeological sites, and islet developmental facies from Ebon Atoll (4
   degrees 34'N, 168 degrees 41'E). Each sample was analyzed by U-series
   and accelerator mass spectrometry (AMS) C-14 showing no substantial
   temporal Delta R variations and yielding a weighted mean Delta R of 41
   +/- 42 yr(1) spanning similar to 500 yr before earliest human
   colonization (the period when islets first became habitable) through the
   entire 2000-yr occupation sequence. Reliable published Delta R values
   for Micronesia and Delta C-14 data for Palmyra Island, together with our
   results for Ebon Atoll, indicate that the Pacific North Equatorial
   Counter Current is almost stable for the past 2500 yr.

AB The Caribbean Community (CARICOM) has recognized regional integration as
   an important development strategy for addressing the unique
   vulnerabilities of its member small island developing states (SIDS).
   Food security in the Caribbean is a fundamental social and ecological
   challenge in which the dynamics of regional integration are increasingly
   playing out. CARICOM members have subsequently identified a number of
   shared food security problems and have endorsed regional goals and
   approaches to address them; however, progress towards solutions has been
   slow. Recognizing that evidence-based studies on the potential factors
   limiting sustained progress are lacking, we undertook a comparative
   policy analysis to understand better the various approaches and framings
   of food security at national and regional levels with a view to
   assessing coherence. We identify considerable divergence in how regional
   and local policy institutions frame and approach food security problems
   in CARICOM and then identify ways through which the policy integration
   objectives for enhanced regional food security might be progressed, with
   a particular focus on social learning.

AB Water striders (Hemiptera, Gerromorpha) are common inhabitants of
   aquatic habitats throughout the world. More than 150 species
   representing five families have colonised the marine environment,
   chiefly coastal areas of tropical seas in habitats with a strong tidal
   influence. The Australian fauna bf marine water striders is particularly
   diverse and species-rich, comprising about 30 species. The present paper
   deals with the marine Haloveliinae (Veliidae) of Australia, New
   Caledonia and southern New Guinea. They are classified in two genera,
   Xenobates Esaki and Halovelia Bergroth. Xenobates mangrove, ovatus,
   major and spinoides (Queensland), X. lansburyi and chinai (Northern
   Territory), and X. caudatus (southern Papua New Guinea) are described as
   new. X. myorensis (Lansbury), X, angulanus (Polhemus) and X.
   loyaltiensis (China) comb. nov. are redescribed. Descriptive notes are
   presented for the five species of Halovelia recorded from Australia.
   Keys to adults of all species are provided and their distributions
   mapped. Finally, we discuss the zoogeography and ecology of the marine
   Haloveliinae of Australia.

AB OBJECTIVE: To determine if 1) Afro-Caribbean women prefer large body
   sizes, 2) the body size preference of Afro-Caribbean men and women are
   associated, 3) women's preferences are associated with increased risk of
   obesity or with weight management behaviors.
   DESIGN: Population samples of 314 and 487 women, ages 20-55 years, were
   recruited on Barbados and Dominica with response rates of 74% and 77%,
   respectively. Body size preferences, stress related variables, and
   demographic data were ascertained by questionnaire. Height and weight
   were also measured. On Barbados, body preference data were collected
   from male partners of participants, and data on intentions to perform
   weight management behaviors were collected from 175 women.
   RESULTS: Most women preferred body sizes within normal limits, although
   women on Dominica had a slightly larger ideal body size (IBS) than did
   Barbadian women (P<.05). On both islands, the size that women thought
   men preferred was related to their IBS (P<.0001). Likewise, IBS was
   associated with increased odds of being overweight (P<.001), however
   most overweight women (>75%) wanted to be smaller. IBS was not related
   to the intention to exercise or to eat high fat foods.
   CONCLUSIONS: It is unlikely that body size preference poses a barrier to
   intervention efforts to reduce the prevalence of overweight in
   Afro-Caribbean women.

AB 'Doubles' or channa (Cicer arietinum) burger is a street-food sold in
   the twin-islands of Trinidad and Tobago West Indies, other Caribbean
   islands and North America. The whole 'doubles' (bara with filling of
   channa) and components of the 'doubles' e.g. bara and channa were
   analysed separately for their nutritive composition. Consumers (200)
   were interviewed using structured questionnaire based on six questions
   to ascertain consumer perception to the product. Samples were purchased
   from six vendors and pooled to form four composites. From each
   composite, two analytical samples were drawn. Most respondents (89.5%)
   ate doubles and had two doubles (40.5%) at one meal. They (45.5%) were
   unsure whether 'doubles' could be considered as nutritious. The
   nutritive composition for 'doubles' was 6.9 g/100 g protein, 8.5g/100 g
   fat, 3.7 g/100 g total dietary fibre, 230 mg/100 g Na, 222 mg/100 g K,
   104 mg/100 g P, 27 mg/100 g Mg, 0.72 mg/100 g Mn, and 0.53 mg/100 g Zn.
   According to the US Nutrition Labelling and Education Act, based on a
   84000 (2000 kcal) diet, consumption of one 'double' provided mandatory
   components of 17% fat, 12% sodium, 12% total carbohydrate, 20% dietary
   fiber, 18% protein, 2% calcium and 25% iron of the daily reference
   values. Of the total 1230 kJ (300 kcal) in one 'double', fat provided
   38% of the energy values and protein and total carbohydrate contributed
   12% and 50%, respectively. (C) 2004 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

   biodiversity associated with coral reefs remains insufficiently explored
   worldwide.

AB The presence of metals in an aquatic environment can serve as a
   biomarker for pollution and can be used to evaluate its contamination
   status. Rapid industrialisation in recent decades has propelled Trinidad
   and Tobago to be one of the most developed nations within the Caribbean
   region and has stimulated the awareness of potential ecological risks
   from various industrial activities affecting the rivers of Trinidad.
   Sediment samples from three rivers along the West coast of Trinidad were
   analysed for Cd, Cr, Cu, Mn, Ni, Pb and Zn. For all three rivers, the
   metal concentrations in sediments were in the range of 0.40-2.31g/g,
   12.77-33.04g/g, 14.51-72.89g/g, 224.90-4472.83g/g, 8.20-43.08g/g,
   22.63-38.34g/g and 92.0-5462.60g/g for Cd, Cr, Cu, Mn, Ni, Pb and Zn,
   respectively. Assessment of the pollution status indicated that all
   three rivers were considered polluted, with significant contributions
   from Cr, Cu, Mn, Ni and Zn. The potential ecological risk for all three
   rivers, however, was low and multivariate statistics revealed that
   mainly anthropogenic sources contributed to the metal concentrations in
   sediments of all three rivers.

AB Rising international demand from collectors for the insects of Papua New
   Guinea, in particular the endemic birdwing butterflies (Ornithoptera
   spp.), has been met since 1978 by the government sponsored Insect
   Farming and Trading Agency (IFTA). Institutions such as IFTA have the
   potential to satisfy markets through legitimate trading, boost local
   livelihoods and thus provide conservation incentives, and satisfy CITES
   criteria. Until the onset in Papua New Guinea of large-scale logging and
   mining in the 1990s, and a crisis of governance, IFTA was widely
   regarded as a conservation and development success. However, analysis of
   its trading records for 1995-2002 suggests that this agency is now
   struggling to sustain payments to village-based insect ranchers and
   collectors. This failure, combined with the limited number of ranchers
   and collectors and their restricted geographical spread, casts some
   doubt on this model of sustainable conservation.

AB The small island developing states of the Pacific suffer from both the
   high cost of fossil fuel imports and from numerous climate-related
   disasters. These vulnerabilities will worsen unless there is a
   substantial global shift away from fossil fuels towards renewable energy
   (RE) sources, coupled with significant improvements in energy
   efficiency. Apart from traditional biomass-fuelled cooking, the most
   substantial uses of RE in the Pacific in 2016 were hydropower in some of
   the hillier island countries and the thousands of household photovoltaic
   (PV) systems in the remoter parts of island countries. This paper
   considers also the prospects for grid PV, geothermal, and biofuels - all
   of which have good technical potential in at least some islands.
   Barriers to wider use of RE in the region are mostly institutional and
   financial, but also include opportunity costs, environmental factors,
   and the limited skills base in small island states. The paper examines
   the mixed progress since the 1990s towards overcoming these barriers.
   The Fiji Electricity Authority has a reasonably realistic plan to have
   81% of its supply from RE by 2020, drawing on hydropower (similar to 50%
   in 2015), biomass (including bagasse), and some solar and wind. Tonga
   has its Renewable Energy Roadmap with clear milestones. Several other
   Pacific Island countries have ambitious RE targets but some are rather
   vague about how they are to be achieved.

AB In most developing countries, planning was initially concerned with
   economic growth. Upon gaining political independence, post-colonial
   countries set about addressing the unmet backlog of physical and social
   infrastructure problems, low rates of economic growth, and poverty.
   Since the post-independence era, development in non-industrialized
   countries has undergone significant changes in both scope and approach
   and has arisen from shifts in international agency policies as well as
   from local factors. These transformations are reflected in issues such
   as the provision of infrastructure, of which water supply is a prime
   example. The aim here is first to provide a schematic presentation of
   five periods of shifting paradigms in water provisioning policies
   globally and give their impact on Trinidad's water policies. Second, it
   seeks to analyse the genesis of government ideology of water as a public
   good. Finally, it identifies the new concepts in water supply that have
   emerged since the 1990s and gives their impacts internationally and
   locally.

   described from the coastal waters and national aquarium of Bermuda. The
   new taxa are joined by two others in the island's flora, B. occidentalis
   and A wynnei, the last representing a new distributional record. The
   cryptic species, B. bermudana, is the most common of all Botryocladia
   species in the islands and was known from Bermuda in the past as B.
   pyriformis (Borgesen) Kylin. Analysis of rbcL sequences shows that B.
   bermudana is most closely related to B. caraibica from the Caribbean.
   These two species share many characteristics in addition to their
   phylogentic positioning. Bontryocladia exquisita is anatomically and
   molecularly most similar to the much smaller B. monoica from the
   Caribbean and Gulf of Mexico, and B. flookii bears a striking
   superficial resemblance to B. macaronesica from the Canary Islands.
   Several anatomical and reproductive characteristics differentiate the
   two.

   Port Moresby, Papua New Guinea (PNG). This group is characterised by a
   high prevalence of non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM) and
   risk factors for cardiovascular disease (CVD). Dietary data were
   available for 285 subjects, 38% of subjects attending a larger health
   survey: the study group was considered representative of the Koki
   population. Mean energy intakes, 11.5 mJ in men and 10.5 mJ in women,
   were in excess of estimated requirements, especially in women. Fat
   intake was predominantly saturated and although the percentage
   contribution was relatively low, the absolute intake was close to the
   level estimated for individuals consuming the recommended proportion of
   fat at an energy intake to maintain a healthy weight. Levels of body
   mass index (BMI), waist/hip ratio (WHR), fasting and 2-hour glucose and
   insulin, triglycerides, cholesterol, systolic and diastolic blood
   pressure and modernity score were not different across tertiles of
   dietary fat content, energy intake or energy-adjusted Fat intake in men,
   but modernity score tended to increase with fat intake in women. Fibre
   intake was surprisingly low given the relative importance of local
   starchy staples which contributed to a high intake of total and complex
   carbohydrate. Cooking bananas and white rice were the main sources of
   energy and carbohydrate, fresh fish was the main protein source, and
   most of the fat in the diet was from coconut products, representing a
   diet transitional between a traditional coastal diet and a modem western
   diet. With continuing modernization and increasing dependence on
   imported foods it seems likely that many communities in PNG will
   experience increases in the prevalence of NIDDM and CVD.

AB The governments of the six Coral Triangle Initiative (CTI) countries,
   namely Indonesia, Malaysia, Philippines, Timor Leste, Papua New Guinea
   and the Solomon Islands have expressed their commitment to protecting
   marine ecosystems and improving management systems. Achieving the above
   commitment requires detailed baseline information on the spatial
   distribution and extent of the marine resources, such as seagrass
   meadows, coral reef, mangrove fotests and seaweed beds, as well as the
   ability to successfully interpret and understand these data. This study
   examined a combination of Landsat image enhancement technique and
   pixel-bated regional growing tools to create a map of marine and human
   habitats with five classes-of-interest: seagrass, land, coral and coral
   rubble, subsurface sand/mud, land, and human habitats for twelve islands
   of eastern Sabah of East Malaysia (extending from 4 degrees 42' N, 118
   degrees 31' E to 4 degrees 12' N, 118 degrees 50' E), located in the
   south-eastern boundary of Palawan/North Borneo Ecoregion (extending from
   14 degrees 31' N, 116 degrees 52' E to 0 degrees 0.04'N, 122 degrees 12'
   E) of the CTI implementation area. Using this method, an overall
   accuracy of > 75% was achieved for mapping of those class-of-interest
   types. The estimated seagrass areal coverage is 274 ha, of which 158 ha
   (58% of the total area) occurred in relatively shallow water areas.
   Using Google Earth data, seaweed culture sites with a total area of 7114
   ha were observed around 7 of the 12 islands. The mapping approach and
   the results of the study will be of immense benefit to natural resource
   management of the study area through enabling conservation agencies to
   prioritize seagrass, coral, seaweed or marine conservation sites and to
   document local threats to those habitats. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All

AB Deep-sea hydrothermal vents in the western Pacific are increasingly
   being assessed for their potential mineral wealth. To anticipate the
   potential impacts on biodiversity and connectivity among populations at
   these vents, environmental baselines need to be established.
   Bathymodialus manusensis is a deep-sea mussel found in close association
   with hydrothermal vents in Manus Basin, Papua New Guinea. Using multiple
   genetic markers (gtochrome C-axidase subunit-1 sequencing and eight
   microsatellite markers), we examined population structure at two sites
   in Manus Basin separated by 40 km and near a potential mining prospect,
   where the species has not been observed. No population structure was
   detected in mussels sampled from these two sites. We also compared a
   subset of samples with manusensis from previous studies to infer broader
   population trends. The genetic diversity observed can be used as a
   baseline against which changes in genetic diversity within the
   population may be assessed following the proposed mining event.

   single greatest foundation for the life and health of our islands,
   soils, rivers, beaches, coastlines, people and the constitute. other
   plants and animals on which we depend. It examines how the protection
   and planting of TOF and the protection and enrichment of traditional
   agroforestry systems and associated traditional knowledge can serve as a
   basis for addressing deforestation, forest degradation,
   agrodeforestation and the loss of biodiversity. It can further serve as
   a foundation for biodiversity conservation and sustainable development
   in the Small Island Developing States of the Pacific Ocean. The nature
   of traditional Pacific Island agroforestry practices and the diverse
   range of time-tested species that could form the focus of national and
   community-based programmes for the protection and planting of TOF are
   also discussed.

AB On the TEW Expedition a hydrographic section was made in June 1987
   across the Samoa Passage; in addition, south of the Passage, a section
   was made through the Penrhyn and Samoa Basins and the Tonga Trench. In
   this paper the flow of the deep water with North Atlantic Deep Water and
   Antarctic characteristics below 3500 m is discussed.
   Temperature-salinity-oxygen relationships show a similarity of
   properties between the Tonga Trench and western boundary of the Samoa
   Basin. The salinity and silicate date show distinct signatures of North
   Atlantic Deep Water and Antarctic Bottom Water flowing into the Samoa
   Passage. Salinity and silicate data in the Samoa Basin and Passage are
   similar to those measured on the STYX Expedition (1968). Oxygen data
   show that the water along the Samoa Basin's western boundary is
   oxygen-rich relative to water in the eastern Basin, but with no oxygen
   maximum in deep water, as was observed on STYX. Geostrophic flow, based
   on a reference surface determined from T-S, O2 curves, shows strong
   northward components (> 10 cm s-1) in the Samoa Passage. On the west
   side of the Passage the flow was southward (< 1 cm s-1) below 4600 m.
   This flow reversal was associated with a reversal of the sign of the
   horizontal potential temperature gradient and also with lower values of
   oxygen, salinity and silicate next to the boundary. The northward
   transport of Lower Circumpolar Water between the Manihiki Plateau and
   the Tonga Trench was 12.3 +/- 3.6 x 10(6) m3 s-1; the flow into the
   Samoa Passage was 6.0 +/- 1.1 x 10(6) m3 s-1. Assuming that only flow
   above 4800 m can exit the northern Samoa Basin because of topographic
   restrictions, the total northward transport into the north Tokelau Basin
   was 9.6 +/- 1.8 x 10(6) m3 s-1.

   paivae C. Garcia, Sergio et Villarreal sp. nov., which is distinguished
   by delicate thallus, long and slender capsules, distinct spore
   ornamentation and a particular epiphyllous ecology, growing closely
   adherent to living leaves. The new hornwort is rare and localized but
   abundant where found. Also the presence of Dendroceros crispatus Nees in
   Africa is confirmed. The genus Megaceros is reported for the first time
   from Sao Tome e Principe, corresponding to the second report from Africa
   of M. flagellaris (Mitt.) Steph. A key to the Dendrocerotaceae from Sao

AB A water mass analysis of the Coral Sea thermocline waters provides a
   description of their distribution, pathways and mixture based on recent
   oceanographic cruises in this region of strong western boundary
   currents. The Optimum Multiparameter method is used to determine the
   relative contribution of core water masses based on their measured
   temperature, salinity and dissolved oxygen. The thermocline waters,
   carried by the broad South Equatorial Current (SEC), are essentially
   composed of four core water masses of different origins. Coming from the
   south, the South Pacific Tropical Water South (SPTWS, sigma=25.3 kg
   m(-3)) and the Western South Pacific Central Water (WSPCW, sigma=26.3 kg
   m(-3)) enter the Coral Sea by the channel between the island of New
   Caledonia and the Vanuatu archipelago. Coming from the north, the South
   Pacific Tropical Water North (SPTWN, sigma=24.5 kg m(-3)) and the
   Pacific Equatorial Water (PEW, sigma=26.3 kg m(-3)) flow north of
   Vanuatu. The upper thermocline water that exits the Coral Sea
   equatorward, is mainly composed of SPTWN carried by the New Guinea
   Coastal Undercurrent. In contrast, upper thermocline waters exiting the
   Coral Sea poleward, in the East Australian Current, is dominated by
   SPTWS. The relative contributions are different in the lower thermocline
   where WSPCW dominates both western boundary currents. This refined
   description is consistent with the dynamics of the main currents, with a
   very strong depth dependence in the partitioning of incoming SEC waters.

AB Knowledge on the spatial distribution, habitat use and processes of site
   selection by marine turtles is fundamental to identify key habitats,
   critical resources, and discrete foraging aggregations for protection.
   This is particularly important for regions of known importance for
   marine turtles and where widespread habitat degradation is taking place.
   The waters surrounding Bimini, Bahamas, provide important foraging areas
   for threatened juvenile green turtles (Chelonia mydas) however, these
   habitats are being severely degraded by coastal development. To inform
   managers on the design of planned future no-take marine protected areas
   (MPA) in Bimini, we used a spatial planning approach and incorporated
   diverse methodologies (e.g., visual surveys, capture events, passive
   acoustic telemetry) to identify areas of high use by juvenile green
   turtles. We also assessed forage items to understand habitat use by
   green turtles. This information was compared with how various
   stakeholders use the local waters to identify priority areas for
   protection within Bimini to maximize conservation of green turtles,
   while minimizing impact to society, and to meet the conservation target
   previously stipulated by government officials. Two regions within Bimini
   (South Flats in south Bimini and Bonefish Hole on the north Island) were
   identified as important areas for protection and suggestions are made on
   their considerations for MPA implementation.

AB Large-scale climate data for the north tropical Atlantic (NTA) region
   show that air temperatures have increased during the past 50 years
   (1955-1959 to 2000-2004) with moderate warming near the Caribbean
   islands to considerable heating in the northern region. This pattern may
   be driven by sea surface temperature anomalies in the same region of
   study that follow relatively small changes in the Caribbean basin to
   stronger anomalies in the northeast. These changes might be associated
   with changes in the long-term pattern of the NTA high-pressure system
   that drives climate in the region. A series of mesoscale numerical
   experiments were designed to study the regional impacts these
   large-scale changes have on the hydrological cycle of the island of
   Puerto Rico. Results indicate that increased easterly surface winds for
   the 1950-2000 time frame disrupts a pattern of inland moisture advection
   and convergence zone, increasing cloud base heights and reducing the
   total column liquid water content over high elevations. This combination
   of factors produces a reduction in precipitation over the central and
   eastern mountains of Puerto Rico.

AB Despite decades of donor support for the water sector, many small island
   developing states (SIDS) have failed to make acceptable levels of
   progress toward achievement of water-related millennium development
   goals and reduction of water-related risks. At least three distinct
   policy paradigms have at different times been regarded as best practice
   for responding to water insecurity throughout the world. Yet, while the
   water management literature points to the need for a paradigm shift
   toward improved governance approaches, there has been little critical
   examination of whether the assumptions implicit within these theoretical
   paradigms are applicable to SIDS contexts. This study reviews the water
   management, governance, and island studies literatures to identify the
   ways in which the unique historical, geographical, and economic contexts
   of SIDS limit or enable the applicability of these paradigms. The
   analysis shows that each paradigm has a different underlying
   conceptualization of governance, and how institutions can regulate
   social-ecological relations for achieving water security. The
   conceptualizations of governance under the adaptive management paradigm
   seem to most closely reflect the complexity of governance in SIDS, and
   may therefore hold the most potential for addressing water insecurity.
   However, the analysis also highlights the need for further research to
   test the application of adaptive management in a way that can also cater
   for the unique socio-political relations that affect the outcomes of
   governance in SIDS. (C) 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

   Pacific, face significant challenges from a changing climate, and from
   increasing extreme weather events, while also lagging behind the rest of
   the world in terms of drinking water, sanitation and hygiene (WaSH)
   services. In order to support planning for the implementation of
   national WaSH strategies and policies, this study contextualizes
   representative urban and rural baselines for Sustainable Development
   Goal (SDG) 6 ("by 2030, achieve access to adequate and equitable
   sanitation and hygiene for all and end open defecation"). We highlight
   specific threats to the current sanitation services under extreme
   weather events such as flooding and drought, both of which are commonly
   observed in the country, and provide suggestions for structural
   improvements to sanitation facilities to increase resiliency. As the
   first detailed nationally representative cross-sectional sanitation
   study in urban and rural areas in the Solomon Islands, the results of
   this paper inform national WaSH policy, strategic planning and
   programming by the Solomon Islands Government and stakeholders.

AB Nearshore fisheries in the tropical Pacific play an important role, both
   culturally and as a reliable source of food security, but often remain
   under-reported in statistics, leading to undervaluation of their
   importance to communities. We re-estimated nonpelagic catches for Guam
   and the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands (CNMI), and
   summarize previous work for American Samoa for 1950-200. or all islands
   combined, catches declined by 77%, contrasting with increasing trends
   indicated by reported data. For individual island entities,
   re-estimation suggested declines of 86%, 54%, and 79% for Guam, CNMI,
   and American Samoa, respectively. Except for Guam, reported data
   primarily represented commercial catches, and hence under-represented
   contributions by subsistence and recreational fisheries. Guam's
   consistent use of creel surveys for data collection resulted in the most
   reliable reported catches for any of the islands considered. Our
   re-estimation makes the scale of under-reporting of total catches
   evident, and provides valuable baselines of likely historic patterns in
   fisheries catches.

AB Research regarding deep-sea benthic foraminifera in the Colombian
   Caribbean requires further development given the complete lack of
   information related to the different groups that constitute associations
   and the ecological functions they fulfill. For this purpose, a taxonomic
   description of Superfamily Komokioidea was composed from macrofauna
   samples from between 1,215 m and 3,179 m depth, obtained during the
   research cruise ANH-COL 4 and COL 5 carried out in 2014. Results showed
   foraminifera belonging to the three families: Komokiidae, Baculellidae,
   and Normaninidae, including five genera (Lana, Komokia, Ipoa,
   Normaninam, and Catena) and five species (Lana neglecta, Komokia
   multiramosa, Normanina conferta, Ipoa fragila, and Catena piriformis).
   This study presents knowledge regarding deep-sea Colombian Caribbean
   benthic foraminifera, which to date have not been recorded from this
   region. Their depth distribution when compared with other studies from
   the Atlantic and Pacific, allows the expansion of taxonomic inventories
   and the characterization of biodiversity within poorly explored regions.

AB Symbiotic relationships on coral reefs involving benthic hosts other
   than scleractinian corals have been poorly investigated. The hydroid
   Pteroclava krempfi is a widespread species known to be mainly associated
   with alcyonacean octocorals in the Indo-Pacific. In the present study,
   P. krempfi was discovered in association with octocorals of the genus
   Antillogorgia (Gorgoniidae) at two localities in the Caribbean Sea (St.
   Eustatius in the eastern Caribbean and Bocas del Toro in the western
   part), updating its host range with an additional genus and family. The
   Caribbean specimens showed no morphological differences and the shape of
   their polyps was consistent with the original P. krempfi description. A
   multi-locus phylogeny reconstruction of the P. krempfi species complex
   based on both mitochondrial and nuclear loci revealed three separate
   molecular clades. Two of them were composed of P. krempfi associated
   with the families Plexauridae and Alcyoniidae from the Maldives, whereas
   a new highly supported molecular lineage included all Caribbean
   specimens of P. krempfi associated with the family Gorgoniidae. These
   three divergent molecular clades represent distinct cryptic taxa within
   the P. krempfi species complex, in which the main interspecific
   difference consists of their host families.

   suggested by Turner and Culliney is further elaborated, with 37 species
   assigned to six groups depending on characteristics of the mesoplax,
   siphons, muscle scars, and method of reproduction. Three cases of
   variation in species of Xylophaga are discussed: variation in response
   to different substrates, variation that possibly is genetic, and
   variation in a normal growth series. Some observations are made
   regarding the ecology of deep-sea wood borers based on experiments
   carried out with wood panels; these support the hypothesis that wood
   contributes to the growth and diversity of deep-sea organisms and that
   the Xylophagainae contribute significantly to the food chain by
   converting wood to a usable form. A section on systematics considers 19
   species of Xylophaga, of which 7 are new, as well as the monospecific
   genus Xylopholas and three species of Xyloredo. Detailed descriptions
   are given of new species.

AB A high-resolution rainfall climatology based on observations from the
   Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission's Precipitation Radar (PR)
   instrument is used to evaluate the influence of small tropical islands
   on climatological rainfall. Islands with areas between one hundred and
   several thousand km(2) are considered in both the Indo-Pacific Maritime
   Continent and Caribbean regions. Annual mean climatological (1997-2007)
   rainfall over each island is compared with that over the surrounding
   ocean region, and the difference is expressed as a percentage. In
   addition to total rainfall, rain frequency and intensity are also
   analyzed. Results are stratified into two 12 h halves of the diurnal
   cycle as well as eight 3 h periods, and also by a measure of each
   island's topographic relief. In both regions, there is a clear
   difference between larger islands (areas of a few hundred km(2) or
   greater) and smaller ones. Both rain frequency and total rainfall are
   significantly enhanced over larger islands compared to the surrounding
   ocean. For smaller islands the enhancement is either negligibly small,
   statistically insignificant, or, in the case of Caribbean rain
   frequency, negative. The enhancement in total rainfall over larger
   islands is partly attributable to greater frequency and partly to
   greater intensity. A diurnal cycle in island enhancement is evident in
   frequency but not intensity, except over small Caribbean islands where
   the converse is true. For the larger islands, higher orography is
   associated with greater rainfall enhancements. The orographic effect is
   larger (percentagewise) in the Caribbean than in the Maritime Continent.
   Orographic precipitation enhancement manifests more strongly as
   increased frequency of precipitation rather than increased intensity and
   is present at night as well as during the day. The lack of a clear
   diurnal cycle in orographic enhancement suggests that much of the
   orographic rainfall enhancement is attributable to mechanically forced
   upslope flow rather than elevated surface heating.

AB Fiji is a small open island economy dependent on energy for its growth
   and development; hence, the relationship between energy consumption and
   economic growth is crucial for Fiji's development. In this paper, we
   investigate the nexus between electricity consumption and economic
   growth for Fiji within a multivariate framework through including the
   labour force variable. We use the bounds testing approach to
   cointegration and find that electricity consumption, GDP and labour
   force are only cointegrated when GDP is the endogenous variable. We use
   the Granger causality F-test and find that in the long-run causality
   runs from electricity consumption and tabour force to GDP, implying that
   Fiji is an energy dependent country and thus energy conservation
   policies will have an adverse effect on Fiji's economic growth. (c) 2006

AB This article examines consumer willingness to pay for energy-saving
   compact fluorescent light bulbs using the results of a stated
   preferences study conducted in the Caribbean island nation of Saint
   Lucia. Geographic location, low income status, and age are found to
   affect willingness-to-pay for compact fluorescent lighting, while higher
   income status and other demographic variables appear to have minimal or
   no significant impacts. Energy efficiency knowledge is associated with
   increased willingness-to-pay for energy-efficient bulbs and with
   increased use of compact fluorescent lighting. Contrary to theoretical
   expectations, past purchase of compact fluorescent bulbs is found to
   have no impact on self-reported willingness to pay. We hypothesize that
   this null result is due to the recent emergence of low-cost, low-quality
   compact fluorescent bulbs in the Saint Lucian lighting market, which may
   be negatively influencing consumers' preferences and expectations
   regarding energy-efficient lighting. Findings support the argument that
   government-sponsored education and subsidy programs will likely result
   in increased use of energy-saving technologies in Saint Lucia. But such
   behavioral changes may not be sustained in the long run unless low
   quality bulbs - the "lemons" of the compact fluorescent lighting market
   - can be clearly identified by consumers. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All

AB The Indo-Pacific lionfish Pterois volitans, introduced to Florida waters
   in the early 1990s, is currently spreading rapidly throughout the
   Caribbean region. This invasive carnivore may cause deleterious changes
   in coral-reef ecosystems via predation on native fishes and
   invertebrates as well as competition with native predators. We conducted
   a controlled field experiment using a matrix of translocated coral and
   artificial patch reefs to examine the short-term effects of lionfish on
   the recruitment of native reef fishes in the Bahamas. Lionfish caused
   significant reductions in the recruitment of native fishes by an average
   of 79% over the 5 wk duration of the experiment. This strong effect on a
   key life stage of coral-reef fishes suggests that invasive lionfish are
   already having substantial negative impacts on Atlantic coral reefs.
   While complete eradication of lionfish in the Atlantic is likely
   impossible, it would be prudent to initiate focused lionfish control
   efforts in strategic locations.

   using manned submersibles, approximately 200 species of echinoderms were
   encountered and documented; 33 species were echinoids, most of them
   widespread in the general Caribbean area. Three species were found to
   exhibit covering behavior, the piling of debris on the upper surface of
   the body. Active covering is common in at least 20 species of
   shallow-water echinoids, but it has been reliably documented previously
   only once in deep-sea habitats. Images of covered deep-sea species, and
   other species of related interest, are provided. Some of the reasons
   adduced in the past for covering in shallow-water species, such as
   reduction of incident light intensity, physical camouflage, ballast in
   turbulent water, protection from desiccation, presumably do not apply in
   bathyal species. The main reasons for covering in deep, dark,
   environments are as yet unknown. Some covering behavior in the deep sea
   may be related to protection of the genital pores, ocular plates, or
   madreporite. Covering in some deep-sea species may also be merely a
   tactile reflex action, as some authors have suggested for shallow-water
   species. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Coral abundance is declining on many coral reef ecosystems worldwide,
   which in some locations has resulted in regime shifts where coral has
   been replaced by other benthic organisms. Although transitions to
   sponge-dominated states have been reported from a number of locations
   across the world after coral declines, they are typically dominated by
   only one or few species. However, there is increasing evidence that
   high-diversity sponge-dominated reefs may persist in the future as reefs
   experience ocean warming and acidification, because sponges appear
   generally more resilient than corals. Here we quantify spatial variation
   in a highly unusual shallow-water (<5 m and deeper) coral reef system at
   Jaco Island in Timor-Leste (East Timor) that is dominated by diverse
   sponge assemblages and has little coral. We found a total of 33 sponge
   species (based on Operational Taxonomic Units) in a total sampling area
   of 15 m(2). We found that sponges were the dominant biological group at
   this site and covered approximately 29% of the benthos, with live coral,
   algae, and dead substrate cover at 7%, 7%, and 54%, respectively.
   Multivariate analysis identified that sponge assemblages varied
   significantly over a small spatial scale (100 m). Our findings differ
   from those from the generally low-diversity sponge reefs that have been
   reported elsewhere as coral has declined and may be more typical of
   future sponge-dominated reefs. Therefore, future studies to understand
   how this reef functions may provide insights into how future
   high-diversity sponge reefs might function.

AB In Vanuatu (Oceania), small-scale farmers' subsistence still largely
   relies on the sustainable use and maintenance of a wide-ranging
   biodiversity out of which root and tuber crops provide the bulk of daily
   subsistence. In neighboring countries, foreign influence since the first
   European contacts, further associated changes and the introduction of
   new crop species have induced a loss of cultivated diversity. This paper
   presents a baseline study of the diversity of root and tuber crops in
   ten communities throughout Vanuatu. In a context where the smallholders'
   agrosystems are increasingly considered as key components for the global
   conservation of crop genetic resources, this study provides clues to
   better understand the effective roles of biodiversity in traditional
   agrosystems. It also provides insights on the rationale behind the
   constitution of agricultural portfolios and discusses how the cultivated
   diversity allows communities to cope with changes and pressures. The
   paper also shows that recently introduced crops neither seem to have
   compromised agricultural diversity nor drastically changed the
   agrosystems in Vanuatu. On the contrary, such crops are used by farmers
   to strengthen the resilience of their agrosystems. A discussion then
   presents the idea of continuity through change and novelty as a critical
   factor for resilience. The paper concludes by discussing the role of
   indigenous agriculture and culture in ensuring food security and in
   development strategies in a larger context.

AB The Mercy International Health Services (MIHS) has sponsored a 4- to
   5-year project in the Republic of the Marshall Islands to improve the
   healthcare offered the Marshallese and to train them to take over their
   own facilities.  The MIHS administers an 85-bed government hospital in
   Majuro, and a 35-bed hospital on Ebeye.  The Mercies plan to turn the
   Majuro and Ebeye hospitals over to Marshallese administrators in about 2
   years and, if necessary, to leave a consultant on the islands for a year
   after that.  The program also provides healthcare for over 8,000 people
   affected by fallout from US atomic tests on several islands, including
   Bikini, that took place in the late 1940s and 1950s.  Malnutrition and
   diabetes are common problems among the Marshallese.  These problems are
   exacerbated by Western junk food.  Infectious diseases are another
   serious health problem, largely caused by a poor sanitation system that
   affects the drinking water.  Typhoid; hepatitis A, diarrheal diseases,
   and parasitic infections are the most common diseases among hospitalized
   patients.  Steps are being taken to improve the water supply, but the
   islands' greatest need is for preventative healthcare, especially
   immunization of children.  A lack of family planning, alcoholism, and a
   high suicide rate among teenage boys also call for counseling and
   prevention programs.

AB The Pacific Small Island Developing States (SIDS) are among the most
   vulnerable to the impacts of climate change. Besides, they are some of
   the most dependent on imported petroleum products in the world, the use
   of renewable energy (RE) can help minimize the economic risk associated
   with the price volatility of fossil fuels. The region is increasingly
   adopting renewable energy (RE) targets and policies. Successful examples
   of RE deployment in the Pacific SIDS exist; however, many barriers
   persist and prevent the use of the region's RE resources in a larger
   scale. Challenges for RE deployment in islands can be grouped in six
   categories: i) lack of RE data, ii) need for policy and regulatory
   frameworks, iii) scarcity of financial opportunities, iv) lack of human
   resources, v) costly infrastructure, and vi) socio-cultural impediments.
   Based on a survey conducted among main stakeholders in the region,
   within the framework of the Pacific Region Capacity Building Initiative
   of the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA) carried out in
   cooperation with the Secretariat of the Pacific Community (SPC), this
   paper identifies the specific characteristics of these challenges in the
   context of the Pacific SIDS, provide a qualitative assessment and
   identifies recommendations to overcome these challenges. (C) 2017

   suboptimal safety practices among vector control and farm workers using
   pesticides in the English-speaking Caribbean. Among other things, the
   survey found that many of 130 pesticide users surveyed were unaware that
   the skin and eyes were important potential routes of absorption. Over a
   quarter said they had felt ill at some point as a result of pesticide
   use. About half the respondents said they had received more than
   "introductory" training in safe pesticide use, and most said they always
   found labels or directions affixed to pesticide containers. However,
   about half said they never or only sometimes understood the labels, and
   many of those who said they understood did not always follow the
   instructions. About a quarter of the smokers said they smoked while
   using pesticides; about a sixth of the survey subjects said they ate
   food while using pesticides; and over 60% said they never wore

AB The family Galatheidae is among the most diverse families of anomuran
   decapod crustaceans, and the South-West Pacific is a biodiversity hot
   spot for these squat lobsters. Attempts to clarify the taxonomic and
   evolutionary relationships of the Galatheidae on the basis of
   morphological and molecular data have revealed the existence of several
   cryptic species, differentiated only by subtle morphological characters.
   Despite these efforts, however, relationships among genera are poorly
   understood, and the family is in need of a detailed systematic review.
   In this study, we assess material collected in different surveys
   conducted in the Solomon Islands, as well as comparative material from
   the Fiji Islands, by examining both the morphology of the specimens and
   two mitochondrial markers (cytochrome oxidase subunit 1, COI, and 16S
   rRNA). These two sources of data revealed the existence of eight new
   species of squat lobster, four of which were ascribed to the genus
   Munida, two to the genus Paramunida, one to the genus Plesionida, and
   the last species was ascribed to the genus Agononida. These eight
   species are described along with phylogenetic relationships at the genus
   level. Our findings support the taxonomic status of the new species, yet
   the phylogenetic relationships are not yet fully resolved. Further
   molecular analysis of a larger data set of species, and more conserved
   genes, will help clarify the systematics of this group. (C) 2009 The

AB Hurricanes, tropical cyclones and other high-magnitude events are
   important steering mechanisms in the geomorphic development of coral
   reef islands. Sandy reef islands located outside the storm belts are
   strongly sensitive to the impact of occasional high-magnitude events and
   show abrupt, commonly erosive geomorphic change in response to such
   events. Based on the interpretation of remote sensing data, it is well
   known that the process of landform recovery might take several decades
   or even longer. However, despite the increasing amount of scientific
   attention towards short- and long-term island dynamics, the lack of data
   and models often prevent a robust analysis of the timing and nature of
   recovery initiation. Here we show how natural island recovery starts
   immediately after the impact of a high-magnitude event. We analyze
   multi-temporal shoreline changes on Taku Atoll, Papua New Guinea and
   combine our findings with a unique set of published field observations
   (Smithers and Hoeke, 2014). Trends of shoreline change since 1943 and
   changes in planform island area indicate a long-term accretionary mode
   for most islands. Apparent shoreline instability is detected for the
   last decade of analysis, however this can be explained by the impact of
   storm waves in December 2008 that (temporarily?) masked the long-term
   trend. The transition from negative to positive rates of change in the
   aftermath of this storm event is indicative of inherent negative
   feedback processes that counteract short-term changes in energy input
   and represent the initiation of island recovery. Collectively, our
   results support the concept of dynamic rather than static reef islands
   and clearly demonstrate how short-term processes can influence
   interpretations of medium-term change. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights

AB Numerous studies have explored the "shifting baseline syndrome" (SBS),
   which suggests that individual perceptions of environmental health are
   formed by comparing the environment to a "baseline" from the past.
   Understanding social perceptions of environmental conditions, especially
   where they differ from ecological assessments, can help guide
   environmental management efforts. In this study we compared ecological
   assessments of coral reef health with perceptions of reef health from
   surveyed residents in five villages in Solomon Islands and Fiji.
   Comparative analysis suggests that respondents from Solomon Islands
   perceived their reefs as being degraded, yet based on ecological
   measurements actually had healthier reefs, while in Fiji fewer people
   perceived their reefs to be declining in health, yet ecological
   measurement showed them to be more degraded than Solomon Islands reefs.
   We found no evidence of baselines "shifting" relative to respondent age
   in this instance and suggest that these differential baselines and the
   inverse relationship between local perceptions and ecological
   measurements may be a result of: (1) differences in the rate of
   environmental change experienced at local scales; and (2) may also be
   related to differences in respondent perceptions of "quality of life" at
   each site. If the success of conservation approaches such as marine
   protected areas (MPAs) are dependent on local social consensus that
   natural resources are diminished or degraded, then tracking broader
   social indicators like "quality of life" and "rates of change" (real and
   perceived) alongside ecological assessments of environmental health may
   prove beneficial to conservation practitioners.

AB In this paper, case studies from the Pacific Islands are selected to
   demonstrate that the price paid for reef fish is an indicator of the
   stage of transition-a community has reached in changing from a
   traditional to a cash economy-driven one. This transition process in the
   Pacific Island context also represents a merger between the nonmonetary
   traditional economic system and the modern, cash-based system, rather
   than a purely economic valorization mechanism. Our case studies from
   French Polynesia, Tonga, Vanuatu, and Fiji also show that the monetary
   valorization of reef fish varies significantly. First, they show a
   connection between the degree to which a community is connected to a
   major market centre and reef fish prices. Second, the connection to a
   major market center among all communities included in this study is
   influenced by geographical isolation. And third, geographical isolation
   is determined by distance from and access to a major urban market. These
   findings apply regardless of living costs or living standards, which
   vary considerably between countries. Given these three principles, it
   can be concluded that reef fish remains a nonmonetary commodity in most
   traditional communities while market mechanisms have already replaced it
   in urban centers throughout the Pacific. Economic calculations reveal
   that the commercialization of reef fishery produce at the community
   level is often not viable or offers only limited revenue potential. As a
   result lower, socially acceptable prices are paid at the community level
   that do not reflect production or opportunity costs.

AB The quality of the coastal waters is now a major environmental issue in
   Tobago due to its role in supporting the economically important tourism
   sector and for safeguarding public health. In this paper we report the
   results of two choice experiments designed to estimate willingness to
   pay (WTP) for an improvement in coastal water quality for two groups of
   beach recreationists' snorkellers and nonsnorkellers Responses from 284
   respondents were analyzed and included both locals and tourists to the
   island who participated in beach recreation Latent class and mixed
   multinomial logit models were used in the analysis of the responses to
   explain the presence of any unobserved taste heterogeneity. An
   additional advantage of using these models was the ability to determine
   individual-specific WTP estimates for each attribute The results
   indicate that individual specific-means of WTP estimates vary
   significantly between snorkellers and nonsnorkellers The results from
   the analysis using the latent class model identified two subgroups with
   distinct preferences with the snorkeller group. Unobserved taste
   heterogeneity was better represented for the nonsnorkellers with a mixed
   multinomial logit model This study not only addresses the lack of
   valuation estimates on this island but also demonstrates the importance
   of using estimation methods that account for individual-specific
   differences in WTP estimates The inclusion of individual preferences is
   especially important in the context of a small-island developing country
   where there is a need to prioritise policy recommendations due to
   limited financial resources and conflicting objectives for natural
   resource management. Crown Copyright (C) 2010 Published by Elsevier B V

   channel geomorphology, and the diversity of aquatic insects (taxonomic
   and functional diversity) in streams running through cloud forest in the
   upper part of La Antigua watershed, Mexico. Variables and aquatic insect
   assemblages were sampled during the dry and rainy seasons, in six
   streams draining different land covers, including forest, pasture, and
   agriculture. Aquatic insect assemblages were related to forest cover and
   riparian vegetation, as well as to various physical and chemical
   parameters of streams. Certain insect genera (Suragina and Anacroneuria)
   were indicators of little forest cover and forested streams,
   respectively. Functional Feeding Groups were related to physical and
   chemical parameters. Seasonality was also found to influence both the
   physical and chemical characteristics of streams and insect assemblages.
   Our findings reveal that cloud forest streams in La Antigua watershed
   are diverse and their insect assemblages are affected by land cover both
   in the watershed and the riparian zone, and by the associated changes in
   the stream physical and chemical characteristics.

   Tassiriki and Lonamilo). While typically missing from community
   vulnerability and risk assessments in the Pacific, local experiences and
   knowledge are a core strength in enhancing adaptive capacity and
   planning community-based activities.

AB Biological production and ecosystem structure in the central equatorial
   Pacific are limited by iron. The primary source of the iron appears to
   be from western island sources transported eastward by the equatorial
   undercurrent (EUC). In order to assess this hypothesis water column
   samples from 15 m to 1000 m from the central and western equatorial
   Pacific and from the northeastern coastal margin of New Guinea and New
   Ireland were analyzed for total particulate Fe, Al and Mn. These new
   data were compared with previously published data for dissolved and
   total dissolvable Fe, Al and Mn. Leachable and refractory Fe, Al and Mn
   were calculated. There were large zonal gradients for all three
   particulate metals near the depth of the Pacific EUC. The subsurface
   maxima were highest in the west (145 degrees E) and decreased
   significantly to 140 degrees W for all species except PMn. The maxima in
   all three particulate metals were at the same depth along the equatorial
   transect. The PFe and PAI concentrations were much higher along the NE
   coast of Papua New Guinea and New Ireland but there were no maxima
   associated with the New Guinea Coastal Undercurrent (NGCU), although PFe
   appeared to have a maximum in the New Ireland Coastal Undercurrent
   (NICU). The distributions of PMn in the western source region differed
   from the other two metals and the equatorial PMn maxima west of the
   dateline had higher concentrations than in the NGCU. There were
   significant correlations between PFe and PAI in both the coastal and
   equatorial stations. The correlations with PMn were variable suggesting
   that PMn may have different sources. In all samples the leachable
   particulate fraction increased from Al<Fe<Mn. There were maxima in
   nonleachable, refractory PFeref and PAlref in the NGCU and NICU not seen
   in the PFe and PAI data. The molar ratios of PFe:PAI (0.41), and
   especially Mn:Al (0.008), were slightly higher than ratios for suspended
   matter from the Sepik River (0.34-0.39 for Fe:Al and 0.005 for Mn:Al)
   suggesting additional continental margin sources of Fe and Mn. The
   primary source of PFe and PAI appeared to be material of riverine origin
   from the continental margin of Papua New Guinea and New Ireland. To
   understand how a particulate iron maximum could be maintained at a
   constant density across the equatorial Pacific we applied a simple model
   where the zonal decrease in leachable particulate iron (LPFe) was due to
   iron loss due to remineralization and loss due to particle sinking.
   Using a sinking rate for 1-mu m sized particles of 0.086 m d(-1), an
   extremely low remineralization rate of 0.006 d(-1) would be necessary to
   produce the observed gradient. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights

AB Jamaica, the third largest island in the Caribbean, has been affected
   significantly by flooding and flood-related damage. Hence assessing the
   probability of flooding and susceptibility of a place to flood hazard
   has become a vital part of planning and development. In addition to
   heavy rainfall from tropical storms and Atlantic hurricanes, several
   terrestrial factors play significant roles in flooding, including local
   geology, geomorphology, hydrology and land-use. In this study, a
   GIS-based multi-criteria statistical methodology was developed to
   quantify hazard potential and to map flood characteristics. Fourteen
   factors potentially responsible for flooding were identified and used as
   initial input in a hybrid model that combined principal component
   analysis with logistic regression and frequency distribution analysis.
   Of these factors, seven explained 65 % of the variation in the data:
   elevation, slope angle, slope aspect, flow accumulation, a topographic
   wetness index, proximity to a stream network, and hydrostratigraphic
   units. These were used to prepare the island's first map of flood hazard
   potential. Hazard potential was classified from very low to very high,
   nearly one-fifth (19.4 %) of the island was included within high or very
   high flood hazard zones. Further analysis revealed that areas prone to
   flooding are often low-lying and flat, or have shallow north-or
   northwest-facing slopes, are in close proximity to the stream network,
   and are situated on underlying impermeable lithology. The multi-criteria
   hybrid approach developed could classify 86.8 % of flood events
   correctly and produced a satisfactory validation result based on the
   receiver operating characteristic curve. The statistical method can be
   easily repeated and refined upon the availability of additional or
   higher quality data such as a high resolution digital elevation model.
   Additionally, the approach used in this study can be adopted to evaluate
   flood hazard in countries with similar characteristics, landscapes and
   climatic conditions, such as other Caribbean or Pacific Small Island
   Developing States.

AB Grenada and the politically associated Grenadines harbor 19 species of
   terrestrial herpetofauna. and four species of marine turtles either nest
   on their beaches or forage in the surrounding waters. The islands have a
   2000-year history of human activity, but the past five centuries had the
   most adverse impact on the environment. Although some members of the
   herpetofauna have responded well to dramatically altered habitats
   (Anolis spp.), others have not (e.g., Eleutherodactylus euphronides).
   Similarly. the introductions of alien predators (most notably Herpestes
   javanicus) have likely impacted some species (e.g., Ameiva ameiva,
   Mabuya sp.), but not others. Several species appear to be genuinely rare
   (e.g., Clelia clelia, Typhlops tasymicris), and sharp declines in
   numbers have been documented for the arboreal boa Corallus grenadensis.
   The future of marine turtles in the area is threatened by habitat
   destruction (development of beachfront habitat for the tourist
   industry), slaughter of adults, and poaching of nests. Eco-tourism may
   hold the key for protection of forested habitats and the herpetofauna of
   this important group of islands.

AB This article reviews the governance and management of Marine Protected
   Areas (MPAs), and the coral reefs they contain, in the eastern African
   Region. This includes the Comoros, Kenya, Madagascar, Mauritius,
   Mozambique, Tanzania, and the Seychelles. Three generations or
   categories of MPAs are distinguished: i) small areas for protection of a
   single species or unique marine habitat; ii) large multiple use MPAs
   designed for coastal development as well as biodiversity protection; and
   iii) MPAs managed by a nongovernmental organization (NGO) or the private
   sector. Each of these MPA types is examined according to the policies,
   legislation, and management systems they entail as well as the economic
   and community situation they operate within. The paper also provides a
   review of some eastern African MPAs in terms of their size and location,
   the type of MPA, zonation schemes, and financial status. The successes
   of the different types of MPAs are discussed based on specific
   indicators, such as changes in biodiversity, infrastructure, compliance
   to regulations and the level of involvement of primary stakeholders in
   the management. From the review it is clear that a fourth generation of
   MPAs may be forthcoming; community-based MPAs. Although lack of data
   makes it difficult to assess the effectiveness of these different
   categories of MPAs, it is clear that no MPA can succeed without support
   of the local communities. Generally, the results of the analysis are
   promising for MPAs, however a lack of data is hampering a deeper
   analysis. The major issues facing MPAs in the region are highlighted, as
   well as some regional initiatives striving to address these issues. A
   number of recommendations are made, aiming to strengthen the
   establishment and management of MPAs in the eastern African region.

AB Fish are a significant food source for Pacific Island Countries and
   Territories (PICTs), but current projections indicate future supply
   shortfalls and distribution gaps in some PICTs. Regional and national
   food security strategies are accordingly seeking practical activities to
   improve food security benefits from fisheries. Expanding the use of
   artisanal Fish Aggregating Devices (FADs) is a popular method of meeting
   these objectives. However, FAD-associated food security benefits are not
   being fully realized in some PICTs because of key policy and management
   barriers. We identify and then discuss some of these barriers in the
   context of Kiribati, a small island developing State in the Pacific that
   is heavily dependent on fish for food and livelihood benefits. We find
   that in the rush to deliver visible short-term results, project
   resources are often unevenly allocated to deployment activities rather
   than across the breadth of policy and management activities required to
   realistically achieve food security objectives. We propose that more
   precautionary, cooperative, context-specific, and integrated regional
   and domestic policy responses to artisanal FAD use are needed if
   Kiribati's food fish security goals are to be better realized in
   practice. (C) 2015 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Sponges are an important structural and functional component of
   Caribbean coral reefs. We support this statement with our data on sponge
   diversity, abundance, productivity, and participation in nutrient
   cycling from Carrie Bow Cay on the Barrier Reef of Belize and from
   comparative studies in other Caribbean locations. Sponges have at least
   six biological and ecological properties that make them an influential
   part of Caribbean coral-reef ecosystems: high diversity, higher than all
   coral groups combined; high abundance (area coverage) and biomass
   (weight, volume) that may exceed values for all other reef epibenthos in
   some areas and reef zones capacity to mediate non-animal processes such
   as primary production and nitrification through complex symbioses;
   chemical and physical adaptation for successful space competition;
   capability to impact the carbonate framework through calcification,
   cementation, and bioerosion; and potential to alter the water column and
   its processes through high water filtering capabilities and exhalation
   of secondary metabolites, We conclude that thorough and informed study
   of sponges is indispensable when characterizing, assessing, or
   monitoring a coral reef.

AB Previously unpublished AMS radiocarbon measurements of a sclerosponge
   from tongue of the ocean (TOTO), Bahamas, as well as preliminary data
   from an investigation of the radiocarbon records of sclerosponges living
   at different depths in the adjacent Bahamas basin, Exuma Sound, are
   interpreted in terms of U-series age models. The data are compared to an
   existing Caribbean sclerosponge radiocarbon bomb curve measured using
   standard gas proportional beta counting and used to interpret a Pb-210
   age model. The Delta C-14 records from the sclerosponges illustrate a
   potential for use of radiocarbon both as a tracer of subsurface water
   masses or as an additional age constraint on recently sampled
   sclerosponges. By using an independent age model, this study lays the
   framework for utilizing sclerosponges from different locations in the
   tropics and subtropics and different depths within their wide depth
   range (0-250 m) to constrain changes in production of subtropical
   underwater in the Atlantic Ocean. This framework is significant because
   the proxy approach is necessary to supplement the short and coarse time
   series being used to constrain variability in the formation of Caribbean
   subtropical underwater, the return flow of a shallow circulation cell
   responsible for nearly 10% of the heat transported poleward in the N.

AB Sustainability is recognized as being critical for the framing of
   engineering research and education with unique opportunities for
   engineering student training through non-traditional university
   partnerships, including international ones. With limited natural
   resources, high vulnerability to catastrophic events, and isolated by
   the sea, Caribbean islands have been pushing for sustainable development
   and have championed adaptation as the main mechanism to deal with
   climate change. Actual demonstration projects or widespread educational
   initiatives needed to solve issues such as water scarcity are limited
   and only a very small work force has training in Science, Technology,
   Engineering and Mathematics (STEM). This paper discusses a secondary
   school student challenge that was developed in the Caribbean to address
   these issues with particular attention paid to Belize and the types of
   linkages that evolved with US based engineering students and the ways in
   which students in the Caribbean and the US were exposed to a global
   environment.
   Twenty-four projects entered the challenge from Belize, two of which
   were formally engaged with student classes from two different US
   universities. A teacher and 5 students from a private secondary school
   in Caye Caulker, a Belizean island, were matched with a mentor at a US
   University. That mentor required the twenty students in his senior level
   Geospatial Technologies for Biosystems Engineering class to work on the
   Belize request to design a composting system based on material,
   financial, and local environmental constraints. Teams of two or three
   university students worked with the teacher and students from Belize and
   presented their findings via SKYPE and as a written report. While being
   mentored by a local Belizean engineer on a stormwater management project
   for their school in Belize City, connections were made to a Professor of
   Civil Engineering at another US university who focused her International
   Engineering Field Experience course on their project. In May 2013,
   thirteen students from her class visited Belize to survey the site,
   teaching survey methods to the secondary school students as well. In May
   2014, another group will visit to continue working on the project, which
   involves the creation of a detention pond and an ecological park for
   outdoor laboratory experiments.

AB Vitamin A deficiency (VAD) and non-communicable diseases including
   cancer, heart disease and diabetes are serious health problems in the
   Republic of the Marshall Islands (RMI), a small island nation of the
   Pacific. These health problems are related to the trend towards
   over-consumption of unhealthy imported processed foods and neglect of
   traditional foods. Breadfruit (Artocarpus altilis and Artocarpus
   mariannensis) is the most widely available traditional starch food for
   RMI people. The ripe fruit flesh is yellow or sometimes orange, as with
   the Mejwaan cultivar, indicative of carotenoid content. Carotenoid-rich
   foods can protect against VAD and non-communicable diseases. Yet little
   information on carotenoid content of Marshallese breadfruit cultivars is
   available. This study documents traditional knowledge of breadfruit
   cultivars using ethnography, and analyzed 6 breadfruit cultivars of 2
   species, A. altilis and A. mariannensis, for provitamin A (beta- and
   alpha-carotene) and total carotenoid content, using high performance
   liquid chromatography (HPLC). The ripe seeded breadfruit Mejwaan
   contained strikingly rich concentrations of beta-carotene (3540 mu g/100
   g fresh weight). Samples of other ripe and mature cultivars,
   characterized by lighter-colored flesh, contained medium- to
   low-carotenoid content (< 5-102 mu g/100 g fresh weight). As samples
   were harvested from field-grown plants, it should be noted that the
   quantity of carotenoids may vary when the same cultivars are planted in

AB The seagrass Thalassodendron ciliatum (Cymodoceaceae) is uncommon in
   Palau, Micronesia, but remnant beds occur in an area of less than 1
   km(2) on the northern tip of Velasco Reef, a sunken atoll, plus small
   areas on its western rim. The ridges are lengthy, consisting of rhizome
   mat and seagrass up to 1 m high, and 4-8 m wide forming curving elongate
   shapes (arcs, concentric curves, circles, patches). Most occur on a
   gently sloping limestone bottom 22-27 m deep, with some as shallow as 15
   m on the Western Rim, and ridges sit directly on top of the limestone
   pavement, with only the weight of mat and its incorporated rock
   materials holding them in place. Photographic monitoring over time has
   indicated they are actively eroding on their edges, but the passage of
   Super Typhoon Haiyan in 2013 caused much greater damage to the beds.
   Small patches occur in shallow water on the east side of Babeldaob
   Island slightly behind the fringing reef crest and have not changed
   significantly over recent decades.

   1852) and Trichogaster pectoralis (Regan 1910). Most native fish species
   utilize invertebrates as a food source. The absence of indigenous
   detritus/substrate feeders in the Angabanga community may account in
   part for the success of the two introduced species on the floodplain.

   Archipelago, situated 1200 km off the coast of Espirito Santo, Brazil. A
   few additional samples came from dredges on top of the seamounts of the
   Vitoria-Trindade Seamount Chain. A total of 23 species in eight genera
   are reported, the vast majority representing new records for the area.
   One species is described as new, Synalpheus trinitatis sp. nov., based
   on the type material from Trindade Island. The new species clearly
   belongs to the Synalpheus brooksi Coutiere, 1909 species complex,
   differing from all its other members by at least two morphological
   features. Four species represent new records for Brazil and the
   southwestern Atlantic: Alpheopsis aequalis Coutiere, 1897 sensu lato,
   Alpheopsis chalciope de Man, 1910 sensu lato, Alpheus crockeri
   (Armstrong, 1941) and Prionalpheus gomezi Martinez-Iglesias & Carvacho,
   1991; the two species of Alpheopsis are recorded from the Atlantic Ocean
   for the first time. The colour pattern of the recently described Alpheus
   rudolphi Almeida & Anker, 2011, a species endemic to Brazil, is shown
   for the first time and compared to the colour patterns of the four

AB Espresso coffee beverages prepared from pure origin roasted ground
   coffees from the major world growing regions (Brazil, Ethiopia,
   Colombia, India, Mexico, Honduras, Guatemala, Papua New Guinea, Kenya,
   Cuba, Timor, Mussulo and China) were characterized and compared in terms
   of their mineral content. Regular consumption of one cup of espresso
   contributes to a daily mineral intake varying from 0.002% (sodium;
   Central America) to 8.73% (potassium; Asia). The mineral profiles of the
   espresso beverages revealed significant inter- and intra-continental
   differences. South American pure origin coffees are on average richer in
   the analyzed elements except for calcium, while samples from Central
   America have generally lower mineral amounts (except for manganese).
   Manganese displayed significant differences (p < 0.05) among the
   countries of each characterized continent. Intercontinental and
   inter-country discrimination between the major world coffee producers
   were achieved by applying canonical discriminant analysis. Manganese and
   calcium were found to be the best chemical descriptors for origin. (C)

AB Madracis auretenra, new species, is described for a common,
   shallow-water, zooxanthellate coral species found throughout the wider
   Caribbean. This new species is distinguished from other species of the
   genus by a thin branched, dendritic morphology and depth distribution of
   1-60 m. Other characteristics include: non-living basal branch portions;
   a fairly smooth coenosteum; a distinct line of coenosteal spines
   centrally located between adjacent corallites; no visible secondary
   septa in corallites; and closely spaced corallites. Individuals of this
   taxon have been incorrectly referred to Madracis mirabilis (Duchassaing
   & Michelotti 1860), which is a deep-water species and which is
   synonymous with Madracis myriaster (Milne-Edwards & Haime 1849), in
   several publications subsequent to 1973. Herein, a brief explanation of
   the taxonomic confusion surrounding M. mirabilis and the undescribed
   species is provided along with a complete description of this new
   species of Madracis. Records of the new species are confirmed for Puerto
   Rico, Curacao, Grenada, and Bermuda. Authors of many recent studies on
   "Madracis mirabilis sensu Wells" will need to reconsider and reconfirm
   the identities of their study organisms.

   urbanization rates and energy consumption rates for water and food
   production. This is because of the difference in decision making
   processes of resource development as urbanization progresses. Some

AB There are three French territories in the tropical Pacific with coral
   reefs: New Caledonia, Wallis and Futuna, French Polynesia. The reef fish
   species composition presently known from these three territories is
   described. Similarities in species composition were analysed within
   these territories as well as amongst territories. These checklists were
   then included in a biogeographical analysis of reef fish species
   composition based on 64 checklists presently available for the tropical
   Pacific. This analysis allowed the definition of 9 biogeographical
   regions. New Caledonia and Wallis were assigned to the same region,
   "South-West Pacific" which also included the Great Barrier Reef, Fiji,
   Tonga and Rotuma. French Polynesia was associated to the Cook Islands
   and Pitcairn-Ducie to form a "South Polynesia" region. Endemism was
   found to be low in most French territories (4.4% for New Caledonia with
   3.3% for Grande Terre, 2.5% for Ouvea, 1.8% for Chesterfield; 0% for
   Wallis; 6.1% for French Polynesia with 8.3% in the Marquesas, 2.5% for
   Rapa; 1.9% for Society, 1.1% for Tuamotu, 1.1% for Australes and 0.4%
   for Gambier). Most endemic species were small, secretive and rare. The
   effects of 4 factors on the distribution of reef fish species were
   tested: distance to the biodiversity centre, island size, island
   isolation and latitude. Total diversity was significantly affected by
   island isolation (p < 0.0001), distance to the biodiversity centre (p <
   0.05) and island size (p < 0.05). The effects of these factors were also
   tested on the relative importance of 17 major families. These factors
   had complex effects, but the major trends indicated that Labridae,
   Scaridae, Acanthuridae, Chaetodontidae, Mullidae, Serranidae,
   Pomacanthidae, Balistidae were primarily influenced by island size,
   Pomacentridae, Lutjanidae, Tetraodontidae and Caesionidae were mainly
   influenced by latitude and Haemulidae, Nernipteridae, Siganidae and
   Lethrinidae were mainly influenced by the distance. to the biodiversity
   centre.

   200 species of ascomycetes, including 173 lichenized ascomycetes. This
   is the highest number of species ever recorded from a single tree. Many
   species are as yet undescribed and this single tree has been the source
   of two genera new to science: Leptocucurthis and Lirellodisca. It is

AB Water and energy supply systems are essential parts of the
   infrastructure on islands. For small islands that are far from
   continents, water shortage is usually the main constraint on economic
   and social development. In order to maintain island water security,
   desalination plants are built to supply fresh water. The plants need a
   great deal of energy, which increases demand for energy and the cost of
   transportation. Thus, it is necessary to design a new island system
   driven by renewable energy. This study investigated the existing type of
   water and energy supply systems in some typical islands of the world,
   and analyzed their advantages and disadvantages. The energy supply
   systems can be classified into three categories: imported conventional
   energy supply system (ICESS); imported conventional energy & renewable
   energy supply system (ICE & RESS); and integrated energy supply system
   (IESS). Water supply systems can also be classified into three
   categories: imported water supply system (ImWSS); imported water and
   unconventional water supply system (IW & UWSS); and integrated water
   supply system (InWSS). The nexus of energy and water is very complicated
   on islands. This paper presents a framework for an interconnected energy
   and water system on an island. The new framework reveals a roadmap from
   "full input of energy & water (FIEW)" through "semi-input of energy &
   water (SIEW)" to "zero input of energy & water (ZIEW)", which leads an
   island's energy and water resources to become gradually independent from
   the mainland. The new framework also reduces transportation costs and
   carbon emissions. The proposed framework is applied to the Maldives to
   aid design of a renewable energy-driven water supply system. The
   characteristics and mutual adaptability of three types of renewable
   energy (solar, wind, and biomass energy) and water supply systems is
   discussed. The results show that a ZIEW system can be realized in the
   Maldives with a reduction in the cost of renewable energy. ZIEW system
   has great potential for application in island regions in the future.

   of significant attention. These levels vary over a wide range, where
   some SIDS still have a low energy access although they may have the
   resources. The energy mix for electricity production is mostly dominated
   by fossil fuels where the transportation cost results in high cost of
   fossil fuels and this leads to a high cost of electricity.

   brushing, hand washing before eating, hand washing after toileting and a
   range of psychosocial factors such as socio-demographic characteristics,
   health behaviour and school affiliation. The results showed that
   patterns of prevalence and relationships were consistent for all
   countries, with weaker associations observed in Pohnpei. In general,
   adolescents reported moderate levels of optimal hygiene practice. Girls
   reported significantly more frequent optimal hygiene practice than boys.
   Logistic regression analysis confirmed that frequent hygiene behaviours
   were significantly associated with gender, parental occupations and high
   levels of school affiliation. These findings suggest the need to
   consider psycho-social and economic factors when examining potential
   influences on hygiene behaviour to ensure effective interventions.

AB A survey of the scleratinian corals of the Swan Islands, Honduras, was
   conducted during the summer of 1974. The 16 spp. collected were
   representative of the shallow-water reef systems of the islands. The
   collections did not appear as diverse as the scleratinian assemblages of
   Jamaica, Puerto Rico and Cuba, but more extensive studies could provide
   more compatible results. [Species discussed include: Actopora
   cervicornis (Lamarck), A. palmata (Lamarck), Agaricia agaricites (L.),
   Siderastrea sideria (Ellis et Solander), Porites porites (Pallas), P.
   furcata (Lamarck), P. asteroides Lamarck, Favia fragum (Esper.),

AB Doubts about the attribution of the Trinil femur to Homo erectus on
   anatomical grounds have a long history. Here, for the first time,
   published stratigraphic information and chemical evidence based on the
   Ca/P ratios confirm that the anatomical doubts are justified. The Trinil
   femur apparently belongs to a more recent stratum above the 'fossil
   layer' (Hauptknochenschicht, HK) in which the Trinil calotte was found.
   It is concluded that the Trinil Femur I belongs to Homo sapiens, whereas
   the Trinil Femora II-V and the calotte belong to H. erectus. The
   chemical evidence derives from the use of electron probe energy
   dispersive X-rav microanalysis (EDXA), a technique that can be virtually
   non-destructive and therefore may be used on scarce fossil evidence.

AB In the Pacific island nations, Ocean Thermal Energy Conversion (OTEC)
   system is particularly sought after since the said region is seriously
   threatened by rising sea level as a result of climate change. In order
   to draw up the most suitable OTEC system for individual needs, it is
   imperative for us to have as much as detailed oceanographic information.
   There have been, however, very few and only limited data of the region
   available. Under these circumstances we have undertaken in December 2003
   our own research and investigation works in the Fijian waters. The
   renowned ocean research vessel "Koyomaru" of National Fisheries
   University, Japan was placed at our disposal for the investigative
   works. This paper deals with not only the results of investigation and
   our subsequent evaluation of the research works but also the comparison
   of two different data, one in the Fijian waters and the other in the
   waters of Palau Republic, another Pacific ocean islands nation, for
   further clarification of the potentiality in Fiji of OTEC system for
   multiple utilization of ocean energy.

AB The problem of flooding in Trinidad, and the Caribbean region, is a
   perennial one that results in infrastructure, economic and social
   damage. This paper uses GIS to examine the factors that may have played
   a part in flooding in the St Joseph Watershed on 5 November 2001. As a
   result a Flood Risk Assessment Map (FRAM) was developed. Data
   development included traversing and developing information layers for
   road, soil and vegetation. Additionally a Flood Depth and Extent Map for
   the Valsayn North Housing Development was developed and linked to
   population and losses due to the flood event of 5 November utilizing a
   questionnaire, field survey data and photographs. A comparison between
   the latter and the developed FRAM indicated that the FRAM, although
   basic, has managed to predict areas susceptible to flood risk correctly.

AB Background: Although surveillance data are limited in the US Affiliated
   Pacific, Alaska, and Hawaii, existing data suggest that the prevalence
   of childhood obesity is similar to or in excess of other minority groups
   in the contiguous US. Strategies for addressing the childhood obesity
   epidemic in the region support the use of community-based,
   environmentally targeted interventions. The Children's Healthy Living
   Program is a partnership formed across institutions in the US Affiliated
   Pacific, Alaska, and Hawaii to design a community randomized
   environmental intervention trial and a prevalence survey to address
   childhood obesity in the region through affecting the food and physical
   activity environment.
   Methods/Design: The Children's Healthy Living Program community
   randomized trial is an environmental intervention trial in four
   matched-pair communities in American Samoa, the Commonwealth of the
   Northern Mariana Islands, Guam, and Hawaii and two matched-pair
   communities in Alaska. A cross-sectional sample of children (goal n =
   180) in each of the intervention trial communities is being assessed for
   outcomes at baseline and at 24 months (18 months post-intervention). In
   addition to the collection of the participant-based measures of
   anthropometry, diet, physical activity, sleep and acanthosis nigricans,
   community assessments are also being conducted in intervention trial
   communities. The Freely Associated States of Micronesia (Federated
   States of Micronesia, and Republics of Marshall Islands and Palau) is
   only conducting elements of the Children's Healthy Living Program
   sampling framework and similar measurements to provide prevalence data.
   In addition, anthropometry information will be collected for two
   additional communities in each of the 5 intervention jurisdictions to be
   included in the prevalence survey. The effectiveness of the
   environmental intervention trial is being assessed based on the RE-AIM
   (reach, effectiveness, adoption, implementation, maintenance) framework.
   Discussion: The Children's Healthy Living Program environmental trial is
   designed to focus on capacity building and to maximize the likelihood of
   sustainable impact on childhood obesity-related behaviors and outcomes.
   The multiple measures at the individual, community, and environment
   levels are designed to maximize the likelihood of detecting change. This
   approach enhances the likelihood for identifying and promoting the best
   methods to promote health and well-being of the children in the
   underserved US Affiliated Pacific Region.

AB Groundwater resources of low-lying atoll islands are threatened due to
   short-term and long-term changes in rainfall, wave climate, and sea
   level. A better understanding of how these forcings affect the limited
   groundwater resources was explored on Roi-Namur in the Republic of the
   Marshall Islands. As part of a 16-month study, a rarely recorded
   island-overwash event occurred and the island's aquifer's response was
   measured. The findings suggest that small-scale overwash events cause an
   increase in salinity of the freshwater lens that returns to pre-overwash
   conditions within one month. The overwash event is addressed in the
   context of climate-related local sea-level change, which suggests that
   overwash events and associated degradations in freshwater resources are
   likely to increase in severity in the future due to projected rises in
   sea level. Other forcings, such as severe rainfall events, were shown to
   have caused a sudden freshening of the aquifer, with salinity levels
   retuning to pre-rainfall levels within three months. Tidal forcing of
   the freshwater lens was observed in electrical resistivity profiles,
   high-resolution conductivity, groundwater-level well measurements and
   through submarine groundwater discharge calculations. Depth-specific
   geochemical pore water measurements further assessed and confirmed the
   distinct boundaries between fresh and saline water masses in the
   aquifer. The identification of the freshwater lens' saline boundaries is
   essential for a quantitative evaluation of the aquifers freshwater
   resources and help understand how these resources may be impacted by
   climate change and anthropogenic activities.

   Concentrations of PCBs (sum of 13 congeners) in the pellets were 0.1-9.9
   ng/g-pellet. These were 1-3 orders of magnitude smaller than those
   observed in pellets from industrialized coastal shores. Concentrations
   of DDTs in the pellets were 0.8-4.1 ng/g-pellet. HCH concentrations were
   0.6-1.7 ng/g-pellet, except for 19.3 ng/g-pellet on St. Helena, where
   current use of lindane is likely influence. This study provides
   background levels of POPs (PCBs < 10 ng/g-pellet, DDTs < 4 ng/g-pellet,
   HCHs < 2 ng/g-pellet) for International Pellet Watch. Sporadic large

AB Raccoons Procyon spp. from New Providence Island in the Bahamas and from
   Barbados and Guadeloupe in the Lesser Antilles have traditionally been
   recognized as distinctive species endemic to their respective islands.
   All three of these 'species' currently possess official conservation
   status of high concern. Bahamian and Guadeloupean raccoons are
   recognized as endangered species by the World Conservation Union (IUCN),
   which also considers the Barbados raccoon to be a recently extinct West
   Indian mammal. However, historical, biogeographic, genetic, and
   morphological evidence demonstrate that all three West Indian raccoon
   populations are the result of human-sponsored introductions from the
   eastern U.S.A. that have occurred in the past few centuries.
   Accordingly, these animals should not be considered either conservation
   priorities or recent losses of biodiversity in the Caribbean. Instead,
   they may actually represent ecological threats to the insular ecosystems
   on their respective islands. Procyonid conservation goals must be
   re-examined and updated accordingly.

AB There are several problems faced by small island developing states
   (SIDS), especially when it comes to waste management and energy
   production. There is little land space available for dumping and fuel
   has to be imported in order to meet energy demands. These problems can
   be mitigated by using grass cuttings from landscaping, which are often
   dumped, to produced biogas, which can be used as a fuel. In this study
   the rates of methane production of 10 different tropical and subtropical
   species of grasses were determined. Based on the results for 20 g/kg
   samples, the specific rates of gas production ranged from 2.40 +/- 0.21
   NmL/gFM/day (Zoysia matrella) to 6.52 +/- 0.36 NmL/gFM/day (lemon
   grass). It was also observed that organic dry matter (oDM) loads did not
   correlate with methane production, suggesting that the oDM content is
   not necessarily an accurate indicator of a substrate's methane
   potential, and highlighting areas for further study. The results in this
   paper provide a database on the rates of methane production of grasses
   which are common to the tropical and subtropical regions and can be
   found in several SIDS. (c) 2018 Society of Chemical Industry and John

AB The northern pademelon (Thylogale browni) is a small to medium-sized
   macropodid that is native to northern and central New Guinea, but is
   also found on some of the islands of the Bismarck Archipelago, such as
   New Britain, New Ireland and Lavongai, where it appears to have been
   introduced. In New Ireland, archaeological evidence indicates that it
   may have been introduced by prehistoric human agency c. 7,000 years ago.
   In the chain of islands that constitutes New Ireland Province,
   historical evidence indicates that the species also recently occurred in
   the Tabar, Lihir, Tanga and Feni island groups prior to undergoing a
   series of local extinctions and range contractions during the first half
   of the 20th century. Furthermore T browni also appears to have declined
   on New Ireland and Lavongai, where it is now restricted to the remote
   mountainous interior. Much of the sudden range contraction coincided
   with the Pacific War (1942-1945), during which time blockaded Japanese
   troops confiscated local food produce. It is postulated that the
   privations of war led to an extended period of over-hunting which drove
   the species into local extinction in much of its former range.
   Furthermore, since the war, ongoing human pressures and a breakdown in
   the traditional ethnozoological translocation / re-stocking regimes
   which would normally have re-introduced this species to satellite
   islands, appears to have prevented T browni from regaining its former
   widespread distribution in the New Ireland Province Archipelago.

AB The Caribbean Low Level Jet (CLLJ) is shown to be a real and dominant
   climatological feature of the early summer Caribbean climate. It
   manifests as an intensification in the trade winds in the western
   Caribbean basin (70 degrees W-80 degrees W) with an east-west axis along
   15 degrees N. It is confined to heights below 600 mb and has maximum
   wind speeds approaching 16 m/s near the Surface. The study shows that
   there is variability in the strength and zonal extent of the CLLJ which
   can be related to zonal SST gradients between the eastern equatorial
   Pacific and the north tropical and/or equatorial Atlantic. When the
   gradient is driven by the Pacific (as in an EL Ni (n) over tildeo event)
   the CLLJ winds are intensified to the north and in its southwesternmost
   quadrant. When the winds are driven by the tropical north Atlantic there
   is uniform wind intensification about the jet axis. The CLLJ is also
   linked to a precipitation maximum over the near waters and along the
   Caribbean coast of Central America (up to 16 degrees N) during June and
   more so, in July. There is evidence of variation at the northern extent
   of this wet zone depending on the ocean basin forcing the SST gradient.
   The CLLJ is also linked to moderate drying in the main Caribbean basin.

AB Climate-stressed groundwater resources present a growing challenge for
   protecting food security and economic sustainability, notably in Small
   Island Developing States (SIDS). These states are some of the most
   vulnerable to climate stress because of their large coastlines,
   vulnerability to rising sea levels, weak access to reliable surface
   water, and limited food production capacity for handling increased
   groundwater scarcity. Impacts of climate stressed groundwater resources
   brought on by irrigation and growing urban demand in SIDS continue to
   receive widespread attention by both scientists and policymakers.
   Policies that limit pumping to protect aquifer sustainability reduce
   short-term economic welfare by unknown amounts that would otherwise be
   secured by both urban and irrigation water users. Yet, little scholarly
   research has addressed economic impacts of climate-water stress for the
   special needs of SIDS for which urban and irrigation pumping compete
   hydrologically and economically over long time periods. The original
   contribution of this work is to address that gap by employing downscaled
   data on precipitation from Representative Concentration Pathways (RCP)
   climate scenarios. Its novel contribution is to conceptualize, develop,
   apply, and interpret an integrated hydro-economic framework to
   understand interconnected physical and economic linkages from managing
   an unconfined regional aquifer system under each of three climate and
   two policy scenarios. The application is to Barbados, a SIDS, for which
   current and future irrigation and urban demands compete for water. The
   framework integrates groundwater hydrology, climate scenarios,
   economics, land use, and groundwater management, with the intent to
   mitigate impacts of climate stress on current economic values of water
   as well as protecting future aquifer sustainability. Results provide a
   framework to guide water management for SIDS vulnerable to climate
   stress for which water of the right quantity, quality, timing, location,
   and price are essential elements of economic development.

AB The extent to which the region covered by the Western Central Atlantic
   Fishery Commission (WECAFC) of the United Nation's Food and Agriculture
   Organization (FAO) consists of distinct faunal regions that could be
   used as a basis for defining fishery management areas is examined using
   the distribution areas of fishes and invertebrates from FAO
   species-identification sheets. The region was divided into 26 areas, and
   the occurrence of species in four groups-demersal fishes, pelagic
   fishes, molluscs, and crustaceans-was used in a cluster analysis of the
   areas. The study indicates a high degree of faunal homogeneity. However,
   if for logistic reasons it were necessary to define management areas
   within the WECAFC region, three major areas could be considered on the
   basis of faunal distribution: coastal North America, including the Gulf
   of Mexico; coastal Central and South America, including Trinidad and
   Tobago; and the Caribbean islands, the Greater and Lesser Antilles,
   including the Bahamas. Because faunal differences between these areas
   are weak, especially for pelagics, other practical fishery management
   considerations may appropriately override biogeographic considerations.
   However, for the same reason, subareas within the WECAFC region cannot
   reasonably be considered in total isolation. Thus, it may be more
   appropriate to concentrate fishery management efforts along
   fishery-specific lines, rather than geographically.

   of Conus species as a biodiversity indicator to monitor human impact and
   conservation efforts in this region. We observed 422 live cone snails on
   10 reefs covering 30 different species, with an overall diversity index
   of 0.924. The two habitats displayed a 74% proportional similarity with
   an average Corms density of 24 +/- 9/ha (x +/- SD, total sampled surface
   area: similar to 0.652 km(2)). Corms flavidus, C. wiles, C.
   sanguinolentus., C. distans and C. litteratus were the five most
   abundant species. Night sampling at marine-protected Lissenung Island
   highlighted substantial differences between clay and night observations.
   Sampling at 30 m depth confirmed the presence of the recently identified
   C. moncuri in this area. Overall, genus Corms was strongly present in
   all of the sampled sites and represents a good low-cost indicator for
   long-term studies of human impact and facile comparison of the health of
   similar, but geographically distant ecosystems.

AB Forests worldwide are experiencing rapid environmental change due to
   human activity. We aimed to increase understanding of anthropogenic
   impacts on community composition and species interactions. In a natural
   experiment, we asked whether subsistence human land use has altered the
   community composition of a Neotropical rain forest on the island of
   Tobago, in the West Indies. We surveyed fruiting plants and birds in
   three adjacent habitat types that varied in level of disturbance, and
   used multivariate analyses to determine whether changes in the plant
   community were associated with differences in avifauna composition. The
   three forest habitats had similar plant and bird diversities, yet
   markedly different species compositions and abundances. Primary forest
   had the most diverse plant community, while disturbed habitats had a
   more homogeneous plant composition. Primary and disturbed forest had
   distinct community compositions, with canopy cover and the relative
   abundance of plant types explaining 83 percent of the variation in bird
   species assemblages. Seemingly moderate human disturbance has led to
   substantial changes in the plant and bird assemblages of Tobago's rain
   forest, outside of a protected reserve. Our study highlights the direct
   links between human disturbance and the structure of rain forests,
   underscoring the impact of even moderate activity on community
   composition. Foreign language abstract is available in the online

   achieved measurable success in the 1990s and then reformed in the 2000s

   public lands renewed threats to the dove habitat. Unlike many of the
   success stories of TAN influence, this case questions the long-term
   efficacy of TANs engaged in political contestation over biodiversity
   conservation in small, economically dependent democracies. Findings
   suggest that when TANs participate directly in political contestation
   over national development policy, they do amplify the voices of local
   activists but lose influence and cohesion when engaged in domestic-level
   political contestation against alliances of elected officials and
   transnational corporations, especially when powerful and popular
   politicians, responding to exogenous economic shocks, link their
   "sustainable" development priorities to foreign direct investment and

AB Island regions and isolated communities represent an understudied area
   of not only clean energy development but also of innovation. Caribbean
   states have for some time shown interest in developing a regional
   sustainable energy policy and in implementing measures which could help
   to protect its member states from volatile oil markets while promoting
   reliance on local resources. Here we examine four case studies of
   renewable energy advancements being made by public utility companies and
   independent energy companies in the Caribbean. We attempt to locate
   renewable energy advances in a broader historical framework of energy
   sector development, indicating a few policy lessons. We find that
   different degrees of regulatory and legislative sophistication have
   evolved in different islands. Islands should have specialized policy
   focus, contrasting the ad-hoc nature of current regional energy policy
   discussion. We also conduct a cost benefit analysis which shows that
   these early, innovative alternative energy projects show themselves to
   be both profitable and significant sources of emissions reduction and
   job creation. This lends support to the potential benefits of regional
   energy policy. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The corals Acropora palmata and A. cervicornis are important Caribbean
   reef-builders that have faced significant mortality in recent decades.
   While many studies have focused on the recent demise of these species,
   data from areas where Acropora spp. have continued to thrive are
   limited. Understanding the genetic diversity, recruitment, and temporal
   continuity of healthy populations of these threatened Acropora spp. and
   the hybrid they form ("Acropora prolifera") may provide insights into
   the demographic processes governing them. We studied three reef sites
   with abundant A. cervicornis, A. palmata, and hybrid Acropora
   populations offshore of Ambergris Caye, Belize at Coral Gardens, Manatee
   Channel, and Rocky Point. Samples were collected from all three Acropora
   taxa. We used microsatellite markers to determine: (1) genotypic
   diversity; (2) dominant reproductive mode supporting local recruitment;
   (3) minimum and maximum genet age estimates for all three acroporids;
   and (4) the history of hybrid colonization at these sites. We found that
   Acropora populations were highly clonal with local recruitment primarily
   occurring through asexual fragmentation. We also estimated the ages of
   10 Acropora genets using recent methodology based on somatic mutation
   rates from genetic data. Results indicate minimum ages of 62-409 yr for
   A. cervicornis, 187-561 yr for A. palmata, and 156-281 yr for the
   Acropora hybrids at these sites. Our data indicate that existing A.
   cervicornis, A. palmata, and Acropora hybrid genets persisted during the

AB HAWAII MR1 side-scan sonar and six-channel seismic reflection data
   reveal a history of carbonate platform growth, drowning, and back
   stepping in the Huon Gulf, Papua New Guinea, This is one of the few
   modern sites where active carbonate platform development and foredeep
   subsidence are linked. Th-230 methods date aragonitic shallow-water
   corals, recovered from a modern depth of 2000 m, at 348 +/- 10 ka. This
   documents rapid subsidence of the Huon Gulf in response to the
   encroaching Finisterre Mountains at an average rate of 5.7 mm/yr for the
   past 348 k.y., the highest subsidence rate reported from any foredeep
   setting, Carbonate deposition has moved toward the foreland at an
   average rate of 110 mm/yr over the same period. Comparisons of the
   measured age with sea-level history (derived from the oxygen isotope
   record) suggest that the reefs may have formed during sea-level
   lowstands and drowned during rapid rates of sea-level rise.

AB Few benthic polychaetes have the notoriety of the bioluminescent
   "glowworm", Odontosyllis luminosa San Martin, 1990, that inhabits
   soft-sediment habitats of the Caribbean. A few nights after a full moon,
   apparently during most months of the year, a most unusual phenomenon
   occurs. Female glowworms leave the sediments, swim toward the water
   surface, and release a bioluminescent egg mass, causing a bright green
   glow near the water's surface. The female's luminescence attracts the
   males, which also glow briefly. The tiny worm has a bright glow, and
   viewing it is a favorite pasttime in the Caribbean. Over 50 years ago
   investigators linked the bioluminescence of Odontosyllis with the
   mysterious lights described by Christopher Columbus in November 1492.
   Reproduction of O. luminosa peaks during summer, when the water's
   surface is brilliantly lit with females for 10-15 min on the first few
   evenings following a full moon. Spent females apparently survive to
   spawn again. They return to the sediments to build new tubes after
   spawning.

AB This paper provides an analysis of the distribution patterns of marine
   biodiversity and summarizes the major activities of the Census of Marine
   Life program in the Caribbean region. The coastal Caribbean region is a
   large marine ecosystem (LME) characterized by coral reefs, mangroves,
   and seagrasses, but including other environments, such as sandy beaches
   and rocky shores. These tropical ecosystems incorporate a high diversity
   of associated flora and fauna, and the nations that border the Caribbean
   collectively encompass a major global marine biodiversity hot spot. We
   analyze the state of knowledge of marine biodiversity based on the
   geographic distribution of georeferenced species records and regional
   taxonomic lists. A total of 12,046 marine species are reported in this
   paper for the Caribbean region. These include representatives from 31
   animal phyla, two plant phyla, one group of Chromista, and three groups
   of Protoctista. Sampling effort has been greatest in shallow, nearshore
   waters, where there is relatively good coverage of species records;
   offshore and deep environments have been less studied. Additionally, we
   found that the currently accepted classification of marine ecoregions of
   the Caribbean did not apply for the benthic distributions of five
   relatively well known taxonomic groups. Coastal species richness tends
   to concentrate along the Antillean arc (Cuba to the southernmost
   Antilles) and the northern coast of South America (Venezuela -Colombia),
   while no pattern can be observed in the deep sea with the available
   data. Several factors make it impossible to determine the extent to
   which these distribution patterns accurately reflect the true situation
   for marine biodiversity in general: (1) highly localized concentrations
   of collecting effort and a lack of collecting in many areas and
   ecosystems, (2) high variability among collecting methods, (3) limited
   taxonomic expertise for many groups, and (4) differing levels of
   activity in the study of different taxa.

AB Despite the ecological and economic importance of the Caribbean reef
   shark (Carcharhinus perezi), little data exist regarding the movements
   and habitat use of this predator across its range. We deployed 11 pop-up
   satellite archival tags on Caribbean reef sharks captured in the
   northeast Exuma Sound, The Bahamas, to assess their horizontal and
   vertical movements throughout the water column. Sharks showed high site
   fidelity to The Bahamas suggesting Bahamian subpopulations remain
   protected within the Bahamian Shark Sanctuary. Depth data indicate that
   Caribbean reef sharks spent a significant proportion (72-91%) of their
   time above 50m in narrow vertical depth bands, which varied considerably
   on an individual basis. This may be indicative of high site fidelity to
   specific bathymetric features. Animals exhibited three broadly
   categorized sporadic off-bank excursions (more than 50m excursions) down
   to a depth of 436.1 m, which were more frequent during the night. These
   deeper excursions during night may be indicative of foraging in relation
   to prey on mesophotic reefs, as well as diel-vertically migrating prey
   from the deeper meso-and bathypelagic zones. These vertical movements
   suggest that Caribbean reef sharks can be significant vectors of
   ecosystem connectivity further warranting holistic multi-system
   management and conservation approaches.

AB This report is part of a series that summarizes the species and
   localities of Costa Rican marine taxa. A review of the literature on
   copepods, both pelagic and benthic for the Pacific and Caribbean coast
   of Costa Rica, includes eigthy species. Sixty seven pelagic species have
   been found, distributed between sixteen calanoid, one cyclopoid, three
   harparticoid and four poecilostomatoid families. Moreover, thirteen
   benthonic species distributed into six families, all harparticoids, are
   reported. Among the pelagic families, Pontellidae has six species, while
   Paracalanidae and Eucalanidae had five each. Other families, like
   Calanidae, Pseudodiaptomidae and Acartiidae had four species and most
   families only one. Forty five species are reported only for the Pacific
   coast, thirteen for the Caribbean coast, only nine species occurred in
   both coasts; being a direct consequence of the more intensive research
   effort in the Pacific. Pelagic copepod biodiversity reflects different
   oceanographic conditions in both coasts. Typical estuarine species were
   found in the lower region of the Gulf of Nicoya, while a mixture of
   estuarine and oceanic species were found in Golfo Dulce. Diversity in
   the Caribbean, specially at the Cahuita coral reef is lower in
   comparison with the copepod diversity found in other regions in the
   Caribbean sea. This may be due to the high sediment resuspension rate
   characteristic of the Cahuita coral reef, which could affect the
   reproduction of many holozooplankters, specially copepods. Although
   sixty seven pelagic copepod species appears to be in low numbers, in
   terms of specific biodiversity it is as high when compared to numbers
   found in other tropical areas. Thirteen species are reported in the
   literature, all harparticoids. Five species, three sub-species and one
   genera were new to science. Balacopsylla is reported for the first time
   from a neotropical regions, while the genus Karllangia, represented by
   two coexisting species in the Caribbean coast, belong to a few
   circumtropical-subtropical genera. The most diverse family was
   Tetragonicipitidae. This is the first effort to summarize the available
   information about the biodiversity of marine copepods for Costa Rica's
   coasts.

AB The species of commercial oysters present in the Gulf of Mexico and the
   Caribbean Sea are the eastern oyster, Crassostrea virginica, the
   mangrove oyster, Crassostrea rhizophorae, and the Atlantic pearl oyster,
   Pinctada imbricata. C. virginica inhabits estuaries along the Gulf of
   Mexico coast and supports fisheries from western Florida to southern
   Mexico. The mangrove oyster grows in estuarine lagoons on various
   islands, including Cuba, Jamaica, Hispanola, Puerto Rico and Isla
   Margarita, and on mainland shores in the Caribbean Sea. The pearl oyster
   ranges from North Carolina to Brazil, but the only current fishery for
   it exists near Isla Margarita Island off the coast of Venezuela. The
   eastern and mangrove oysters inhabit turbid shallow waters, while the
   pearl oyster inhabits clear deeper (3-11 m) waters. The oysters have
   similar life histories: synchronous spawning by males and females,
   external fertilization, a planktonic larval period of one to two weeks,
   and settlement onto hard surfaces. The principal predators of all the
   oyster species are boring gastropods and crabs. In the U. S. Gulf of
   Mexico, most eastern oysters currently are harvested by about 1200
   dredging and tonging boats and 3,300 men. Recent annual harvests, about
   4.5 million bushels, are sold in the southern and eastern U.S. Mexico's
   eastern oyster fishery is comprised of about 350 outboard motor boats;
   most harvesting is by tonging. Annual landings in Mexico are about 1.0
   million bushels. In the Caribbean Sea, an estimated 200 fishermen gather
   mangrove oysters in various estuaries. Annual landings total
   50,000-60,000 bushels with the most being landed in Cuba. The pearl
   oyster is harvested near Isla Margarita, Venezuela by dredging with
   outboard motor boats. About 40 boats and 120 fishermen comprise the
   fishery; annual landings are about 20,000 bushels.

PY 2011
AB In developed countries a social learning approach has been shown to
   support Integrated Water Resources Management (IWRM) by fostering
   stakeholders' understanding of system complexity, recognition of mutual
   dependence, appreciation of others' perspectives, and development of the
   capacity to work together and to create mutual trust. Much less is known
   about social learning's potential in less developed small island states,
   particularly postconflict island states, where integration must navigate
   prescriptive management, limited resources, widely differing world
   views, a history of adversarial relationships, and unsuccessful attempts
   at government-community collaboration. This paper analyzes the
   transformative aspects of a social learning experience that occurred
   during research facilitating participatory integrated catchment
   management in the Pacific. The study elicited community and expert
   knowledge to create systems understanding to generate and analyze
   complex scenarios for integrated catchment risk assessment in the
   Kongulai catchment, Solomon Islands. Separate sequenced and then
   combined discussions led to facilitated exploration of others'
   subjective assessment of catchment risks and management options. Issues
   of transparency, trust, accountability, and mutual responsibility were
   explored in carefully created discursive spaces, assisted by the
   immediacy of personal contact and the absence of complex bureaucratic
   structures. Despite historical difficulties, through the use of bridging
   individuals, participants were generally able to transcend the
   constraints of their individual knowledge cultures, expand awareness and
   appreciation of the complexity of human-environment systems for IWRM,
   and envisage new opportunities for productively working together in
   integrated catchment management.

AB Uplifted coral terraces at Huon Peninsula, Papua New Guinea, preserve a
   record of sea level, sea-surface temperature, and salinity from the
   penultimate deglaciation. Remnants have been found of a shallow-water
   reef that formed during a pause, similar to the Younger Dryas, in the
   penultimate deglaciation at 130,000 +/- 2000 years ago, when sea Level
   was 60 to 80 meters lower than it is today. Porites coral, which grew
   during this period, has oxygen isotopic values and strontium/calcium
   ratios that indicate that sea-surface temperatures were much cooler (22
   degrees +/- 2 degrees C) than either Last Interglacial or present-day
   tropical temperatures (29 degrees +/- 1 degrees C). These observations
   provide further evidence for a major cooling of the equatorial western
   Pacific followed by an extremely rapid rise in sea level during the
   Latter stages of Termination II.

AB The species composition, distribution, and abundance of the planktonic
   medusae collected during a plankton survey in Banco Chinchorro, an
   oceanic reef atoll of the western Caribbean were studied. Samples
   included the forereef (oceanic) zone and the reef lagoon. Highest mean
   medusan abundance was observed over the forereef zone and in nighttime
   samples, lowest abundances occurred in the reef lagoon. A total of 16
   species was identified, Aglaura hemistoma, Liriope tetraphylla, and
   Solmundella bitentaculata being the most abundant. Together, they
   comprised up to 80% of the total numerical abundance of medusae in the
   sampled area. They belong to a group of medusae dominant in the oceanic
   and reef-related areas of the western Caribbean Sea and in the southern
   Gulf of Mexico. Cluster analysis revealed forereef and reef lagoon
   assemblages, the latter with lowest density, diversity, and species
   richness. The reef lagoon showed a weak oceanic influence along and
   across the Banco Chinchorro reef-atoll system. Dominance of oceanic
   forms within the reef lagoon was attributed to the effect of the
   across-reef tidal currents. The community structure of the reef-related
   medusan fauna appeared to be quite uniform despite the expected
   migratory behavior of these zooplankters, tidal exchange across the
   reef, input of oceanic species, and time of day. New surveys including
   the polyp hydroid together with the medusae are needed in Banco
   Chinchorro.

AB The systematics and the phylogenetic position of the Caribbean
   representatives of Phaenonotum Sharp (Coleoptera: Hydrophilidae) are
   investigated to understand the composition of the Caribbean fauna and
   its origin. Phylogenetic analysis based on mitochondrial and nuclear
   genes has revealed the Caribbean species to be situated in three deeply
   nested clades, inferring multiple colonization of Caribbean islands from
   the continent. Time-tree analysis and BioGeoBEARS analyses of ancestral
   ranges estimated the oldest clade, consisting of wingless single-island
   endemics of Cuba (P. delgadoi), Jamaica (P. ondreji sp. nov.) and
   Hispaniola (P. laterale sp. nov.), to have diverged c. 46.6 Mya from the
   South American ancestor and subsequently colonizing the Caribbean most
   likely via the GAARlandia land bridge connecting South America with the
   Greater Antilles. The remaining three Caribbean species, including the
   Puerto Rican endemic, P. borinquenum sp. nov., are of more recent
   (Miocene to Pliocene) origin and colonized the Greater Antilles by
   over-water dispersal. All the Caribbean species are illustrated and
   diagnosed, and three new species are described. The genus Phaenonotum,
   excluding P. caribense Archangelsky, is confirmed as a monophylum. We
   demonstrate that species-level taxonomy of Phaenonotum is difficult to
   solve by morphology alone and ideally requires the combination of
   morphology and molecular markers.

AB Aim We investigated the evolutionary relationships and historical
   biogeography of two lizard species (Anolis desechensis and Anolis
   monensis) endemic to small oceanic islands in the eastern Caribbean Sea.
   Location Desecheo, Mona and Monito Islands, in the Mona Passage, and
   Puerto Rico, eastern Caribbean Sea.
   Methods We reconstructed the phylogenetic relationships of A.
   desechensis and A. monensis from DNA sequences of two mitochondrial
   genes using maximum likelihood, Bayesian inference and maximum parsimony
   methods. The ingroup included species from Puerto Rico (Anolis cooki,
   Anolis cristatellus), the Bahamas (Anolis scriptus), and the British
   Virgin Islands (Anolis ernestwilliamsi). We also constructed a
   median-joining mutational network to visualize relationships among the
   haplotypes of A. cooki and A. monensis from Mona and Monito Islands.
   Results The three phylogenetic methods suggested the same pattern of
   relationships. Anolis desechensis nests within A. cristatellus, and is
   most closely related to A. cristatellus from south-western Puerto Rico.
   Our analyses also indicated that A. monensis is the sister species of A.
   cooki, an anole restricted to the south-western coast of Puerto Rico.
   Although they are closely related, the populations of A. monensis from
   Mona and Monito can be distinguished genetically.
   Main conclusions The ancestors of A. desechensis and A. monensis
   colonized Desecheo, and Mona and Monito Islands, respectively, from
   localities in south-western Puerto Rico, not from places on Puerto Rico
   geographically closer to the islands. The ancestors of these two anoline
   species probably arrived on the islands via waif dispersal. Anolis eggs
   can survive immersion in salt water for several hours, thus flotsam
   could successfully have transported all developmental stages of these
   lizards from the source area to a new locality.

AB Energy poverty is widespread in Small Island Developing States (SIDS) of
   the Pacific. It is estimated that 70 percent of Pacific Islander
   households do not have access to electricity, which is equivalent to
   access rates in sub-Saharan Africa and slightly below the average for
   low income countries. Pacific SIDS face unique challenges in expanding
   access to electricity, given that their populations are spread across
   tens of thousands of islands. Governments and development partners in
   Pacific SIDS continue to prioritise development of electricity grids, as
   is evident in ongoing subsidisation of grid-based power consumption and
   the establishment of ambitious (grid-based) renewable energy targets.
   This paper argues that traditional approaches to rural electrification
   which prioritise grid extension are not suited to the Pacific islands
   region. Increased funding should be directed by both governments and
   development partners towards rural electrification, especially in
   off-grid areas where isolated systems are more appropriate.
   Institutional reform is also important. Regulatory reform is needed for
   power utilities to extend electricity grids into rural areas.
   Institutional arrangements that facilitate the sustainable operation and
   maintenance of off-grid systems also need to be established. Past donor
   and government-funded off-grid rural electrification projects have
   rarely been sustainable. Alternative approaches involving payment of
   output-based subsidies to energy service companies are worth exploring,
   although will only succeed where sound regulatory arrangements are in
   place. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Data collected during the DIAPISAR Cruise (Nov. 1990) using the French
   deep-towed side-scan-sonar (S.A.R.) are presented. These data provide
   clear evidence of recent tectonic activity in the southern part of the
   Barbados accretionary prism. Many markers as linear lineaments or
   'sigmoidal features' which are observed on diagenetically indurated
   sea-floor are the surficial traces of faults or folds and networks of
   conjugate fractures where fluids are released through the structures and
   provide very active venting. These markers can serve as a basis for
   detailed mapping of some of the tectonic structures and for an analysis
   of their kinematic evolution. Their geometry suggests the occurrence of
   reworked folds and shear zones.
   This domain is affected by abundant clay-diapiric tectonics due to the
   interaction between: (1) the sedimentological context characterized by
   the important terrigenous supplies coming from the Orinoco River and
   building a wide prodelta in which levels of clay supersaturated in water
   can act as decollement layers, and (2) the geodynamic context of the
   area situated in the connection zone of three different types of
   margins. The data presented show that, on the eastern end of the South
   Caribbean wrench fault system, shear stresses can rework either 'en
   echelon' folds associated with this system or compressional structures
   due to subduction. The most recent structures seem largely due to the
   influence of shearing and correspond to transpressive or transtensive
   deformations rather than pure compressional structures. (C) 1998

AB The processes which drive the production and the growth of the strong
   mesoscale eddy field in the Caribbean Sea are examined using a general
   circulation model. Diagnostics of the simulations suggest that: (1) The
   mean currents in the Caribbean Sea are intrinsically unstable. The
   nature of the instability and its strength vary spatially due to strong
   differences of current structure among basins. (2) The greatest and most
   energetic eddies of the Caribbean Sea originate in the Venezuela Basin
   by mixed barotropic-baroclinic instability of an intense jet, formed
   with waters mostly froth the surface return flow of the Meridional
   Overturning Circulation and the North Equatorial Current which converge
   and accelerate through the Grenada Passage. The vertical shear of this
   inflow is enhanced by an eastward undercurrent, which flows along the
   south American Coast between 100 and 250 to depth. The shallow eddies
   (less than 200 m depth) formed in the vicinity of the Grenada Passage
   get rapidly deeper (down to 1000 to depth) and stronger by their
   interaction with the deep interior flow of the Subtropical Gyre, which
   enters through passages north of St. Lucia. These main eastern Caribbean
   inflows merge and form the southern Caribbean Current, whose baroclinic
   instability is responsible for the westward growth and strengthening of
   these eddies from the Venezuela to the Colombia Basin. (3) Eddies of
   lesser strength are produced in other regions of the Caribbean Sea.
   Their generation and growth is also linked with instability of the local
   currents. First, cyclones are formed in the cyclonic shear of the
   northern Caribbean Current, but appear to be rapidly dissipated or
   absorbed by the large anticyclones coming from the southern Caribbean.
   Second, eddies in the Cayman Sea, which impact the Yucatan region, are
   locally produced and enhanced by barotropic instability of the deep
   Cayman Current. (4) The role of the North Brazil Current (NBC) rings is
   mostly to act as a finite perturbation for the instability of the mean
   flow. Their presence near the Lesser Antilles is ubiquitous and they
   appear to be linked with most of the Caribbean eddies. There are some
   evidences that the frequency at which they form near the Grenada Passage
   is influenced by the frequency at which the NBC rings impinge the Lesser
   Antilles. But large Caribbean eddies also form without a close influence
   of any ring, and comparison between simulations shows that mean eddy
   kinetic energy and eddy population in the Caribbean Sea are not
   substantially different in absence or presence of NBC rings: their
   presence is not a necessary condition for the generation and growth of
   the Caribbean eddies. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Hydrothermal vents are ephemeral systems. When venting shuts down,
   sulfide-dependent taxa die off, and non-vent taxa can colonize the hard
   substrata. In Manus Basin (Papua New Guinea), where hydrothermally
   active and inactive sites are interspersed, hydroids, cladorhizid
   sponges, barnacles, bamboo corals, and other invertebrate types may
   occupy inactive sites. Carbon and nitrogen isotopic compositions of
   animals occupying inactive sites are consistent with nutritional
   dependence on either chemoautotrophically or photosynthetically produced
   organic material, but sulfur isotopic compositions of these animals
   point to a chemoautotrophic source of sulfur from dissolved sulfide in
   vent fluids rather than sulfur derived from seawater sulfate through
   photosynthesis. Given that suspension-feeding and micro-carnivorous
   invertebrates are the biomass dominants at inactive sites, the primary
   source of chemoautotrophic nutrition is likely suspended particulates
   and organisms delivered from nearby active vents. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

   dispersers. Communities of free-living Symbiodinium were found within

   ribosomal DNA (cp23S-rDNA). Determination of free-living Symbiodinium
   and mechanisms of dispersal is important in understanding the life cycle

AB Recently, there has been a decline in the consumption of indigenous
   vegetables in Papua New Guinea, with an increasing consumer preference
   for imported foods such as tinned meats, rice, flour, and tinned fish;
   particularly in middle-to-high income households in urban communities.
   This study into the challenges and opportunities for indigenous
   vegetable consumption in Papua New Guinea found that factors relating to
   increasing urbanisation and land pressure such as: physical access to
   land to grow or collect indigenous vegetables, cultural perceptions,
   loss of knowledge in growing and cooking indigenous vegetables, changes
   in life style, introduction of new vegetables, and the loss of natural
   habitats containing wild food resources were all contributors to the
   decline in cultivation and consumption. However, the study also found a
   rise in consumption of indigenous vegetables among low income urban
   families, and identified several opportunity points for the promotion of
   indigenous vegetables such as; potential health benefits, cheaper
   prices, availability, and association with custom and tradition.
   Practices associated with ethnic food are at the core of indigenous
   cultures and are considered to be the most resilient of all habits in an
   acculturation context, and could prove to be an important aspect in
   fostering an emotional connection with indigenous vegetables for
   consumers.

AB Recent bathymetric, hydrographic and direct velocity measurements
   indicate that a previously unexplored deep passage in the northeastern
   Caribbean Sea may play a significant role in the abyssal ventilation of
   this basin. The Anegada-Jungfern Passage complex has long been
   recognized as the sole pathway for deep Atlantic inflow to the eastern
   Caribbean. The Anegada Passage (sill depth 1915 m) connects the Atlantic
   Ocean with the small Virgin Islands Basin, while Jungfern Passage (sill
   depth 1815 m) connects the latter with the large and deep Venezuela
   Basin comprising the eastern third of the Caribbean Sea. In the region
   of Jungfern Passage recent bathymetric measurements reveal additional,
   shallower routes for Atlantic inflow at depths between 1710 and 1630 m.
   Despite the relatively shallow controlling depths of these passages,
   direct measurements of velocity and watermass properties reveal an
   active inflow of water of Atlantic origin. Bathymetric and other
   oceanographic observations indicate that the previously unexplored
   Grappler Channel (sill depth 1710 m; located just west of Jungfern
   Passage) is responsible for up to 20% of the total inflow to the abyssal
   Caribbean from the mid-depth Atlantic (about 0.2 Sv).

AB The Nature Conservancy takes a strategic and systematic approach to
   conservation planning. Ecoregional assessments are used to set goals and
   identify geographical priorities, and Conservation Action Planning is
   used to develop strategic plans for conservation areas. This study
   demonstrates how these planning processes were applied at the seascape
   scale based on a case study of Kimbe Bay, Papua New Guinea. Conservation
   Action Planning was used to identify key threats and strategies, and
   systematic conservation planning (similar to that used for ecoregional
   assessments) was used to design a network of marine protected areas to
   be resilient to the threat of climate change. The design was based on an
   assessment of biodiversity and socio-economic values, and identified 14
   Areas of Interest that meet specific conservation goals. A detailed
   community-based planning process is now underway with local communities
   that own and manage these areas to refine and implement the marine
   protected area network.

AB According to a critical analysis of the 779 available bibliographic
   references and the recent field surveys unpublished results, the
   reptilian fauna of Central Africa and Angola involves 531 species in 23
   families and 136 genera. Two families, 5 genera and 5 species are
   sea-turtles; others have terrestrial or freshwater habitats. Snakes
   biodiversity exceeds that of lizards, slightly for species (respectively
   248 versus 233 sp), more for genera (67 versus 50 g). Scincidae (82 sp),
   Gekkonidae (55 sp) and two Colubridae sub-families, Colubrinae (53 sp)
   and Lamprophiinae (46 sp) are the most diversified supra-generic taxa.
   The species geographical areas are larger for the snakes (76 sp in only
   one country versus 75 sp in 6-8 countries) than for the lizards
   (respectively 133 versus 18 sp). The seven continental countries share
   almost the same number (20-23) of families but, at the generic and
   specific levels, Congo-Kinshasa, Angola and Cameroon have the richest
   faunas. Generic and specific affinities between reptilian faunas display
   the strong originality of Sao Tome e Principe and the occurrence among
   the seven continental countries of three zoogeographic sub-units. Six
   genera, one sub-genus and 110 species (20.7%) are endemic eighter of one
   country (77 sp) or of several countries (33 sp). Eighteen terrestrial
   and freshwater reptile species, among which 7 endemic, dwell on the
   three small oceanic islands of Sao Tome e Principe. Dysharmony of the
   faunal taxonomic composition of the seven islands in the Gulf of Guinea
   is emphasized.

AB Spurilla neapolitana (Delle Chiaje, 1823) was considered to be a species
   with a broad geographic range and substantial colour variability;
   however, analyses of mitochondrial and nuclear gene data revealed that
   it is a complex of five distinct species. Further anatomical and
   morphological examinations determined that coloration is one of the main
   diagnostic traits for all five species, although some display
   substantial colour pattern variation. As a result of this study,
   S.neapolitana is determined to be restricted to the Mediterranean and
   eastern Atlantic. Spurilla sargassicola Bergh, 1871 from the Caribbean
   is redescribed and confirmed as a valid species. The name Spurilla
   braziliana MacFarland, 1909 is retained for western Atlantic and Pacific
   populations. Two new species are described herein. Spurilla
   onubensissp.nov. occurs in Europe, with a range overlapping that of
   S.neapolitana. Finally, Spurilla dupontaesp.nov. is found in the

AB Surveys of the freshwater crabs of two islands in the Gulf of Guinea,
   Central Africa, allowed a revision of the taxonomy of two little-known
   island endemic species, based for the first time on adult males:
   Potamonaute.s margaritarius (A. Milne-Edwards, 1869) from Sao Tome, and
   of P. principe Cumberlidge, Clark and Baillie, 2002, from Principe
   (Brachyura; Potamonautidae). A new species of Potamonautes from southern
   Sao Tome (Potamonautes saotome sp. nov.) is also described that is
   genetically distinct and has a clearly separate geographic distribution
   from P. margaritarius from northern Sao Tome. The new species from
   southern Sao Tome can be recognized by a suite of characters of the
   carapace, thoracic sternum, and gonopods. The taxonomy of P.
   margaritarius (A. Milne-Edwards, 1869) is stabilized by selecting a
   neotype from northern Sao Tome. Potamonautes principe from Principe is
   the most distinct of the three taxa, with a more swollen carapace that
   has smooth anterolateral margins, and a shorter, straighter male first
   gonopod. All three taxa are morphologically distinct species that have
   also been clearly distinguished as evolutionarily separate lineages by
   mtDNA analysis and haplotyping in an earlier study. Previous
   phylogenetic evidence supports two separate island colonization events
   at different times in the past from different ancestral populations, one
   to Sao Tome and another to Principe that resulted in the establishment
   of the endemic freshwater crab faunas of these two islands.

AB The 'island factor' refers to a series of shared energy-related issues
   that many island nations face due to their isolation and limited
   population size. Under such conditions, one of the only ways to reduce
   energy costs for consumers is through energy efficiency including the
   use of energy-saving compact fluorescent light bulbs. This study uses
   consumer survey data to investigate how awareness, past purchasing
   behaviour, and demographic characteristics influence Saint Lucian
   consumers' intentions to purchase energy-saving compact fluorescent
   bulbs. The findings indicate that a lack of awareness and understanding
   of energy efficiency, combined with high product costs and a lack of
   product availability currently inhibit the adoption of compact
   fluorescent technologies by Saint Lucian consumers. Awareness of energy
   efficiency, income and geographic location are identified as significant
   factors related to increased use of and willingness to pay for compact
   fluorescent bulbs. In the discussion, possibilities for public education
   and cost subsidy for compact fluorescent bulb promotion are proposed.

AB A workshop was held at the University of the West Indies, Jamaica, in
   May 2012 to build capacity in climate data rescue and to enhance
   knowledge about climate change in the Caribbean region. Scientists
   brought their daily observational surface temperature and precipitation
   data from weather stations for an assessment of quality and homogeneity
   and for the calculation of climate indices helpful for studying climate
   change in their region. This study presents the trends in daily and
   extreme temperature and precipitation indices in the Caribbean region
   for records spanning the 1961-2010 and 1986-2010 intervals. Overall, the
   results show a warming of the surface air temperature at land stations.
   In general, the indices based on minimum temperature show stronger
   warming trends than indices calculated from maximum temperature. The
   frequency of warm days, warm nights and extreme high temperatures has
   increased while fewer cool days, cool nights and extreme low
   temperatures were found for both periods. Changes in precipitation
   indices are less consistent and the trends are generally weak. Small
   positive trends were found in annual total precipitation, daily
   intensity, maximum number of consecutive dry days and heavy rainfall
   events particularly during the period 1986-2010. Correlations between
   indices and the Atlantic multidecadal oscillation (AMO) index suggest
   that temperature variability and, to a lesser extent, precipitation
   extremes are related to the AMO signal of the North Atlantic surface sea
   temperatures: stronger associations are found in August and September
   for the temperature indices and in June and October for some of the
   precipitation indices.

AB Aqueous neem seed kernel extract from Azadirachta siamensis (from
   Thailand, ATNSKE) and A. indica (from Papua New Guinea, ANSKE) have been
   used in field experiments, conducted in the lowlands of Papua New Guinea
   to control the Asian Corn Stem Borer Ostrinia furnacalis (ACB). The use
   of imported neem kernels from A. siamensis showed that only an ATNSKE
   with a high concentration of 50 g TNSK powder per litre of water had an
   effect on larval populations in the field, while a concentration of 20 g
   NSK powder per litre of water from locally grown neem trees applied
   between 50 and 60 days after sowing turned out to be sufficient to
   control the later instars of O. furnacalis larvae in the field. A
   significantly higher;yield in ANSKE- and ATNSKE- treated fields was
   obtained. The combination of the inundative method of an early release
   of 140,000 endemic Trichogramma plasseyensis wasps per hectare including
   the detasseling of 75% of corn plants and one application of NSKE proved
   to be the best conception programme to control ACB in Papua New Guinea.
   No side effects on predators like spiders were noticed.

   Microhrdromys) reveal outstanding undiagnosed taxic diversity (a minimum
   of 16 species, versus the eight species previously described) and allow
   for redefinition of generic boundaries among these little-studied
   rodents. Apart from Microhydromys Tate and Archbold, 1941 (comprising
   two species, as recently revised by Helgen et al., in press), herein we
   recognize two genera of New Guinea moss-mice: Pseudohydromys Rummler,
   1934 (now incorporating Neohydromys Laurie, 1952, Mayermys Laurie and
   Hill, 1954, and "Microhydromys" musseri Flannery, 1989) and a newly
   described genus, Mirzamys. Species of Pseudohydromys are recorded from
   montane areas throughout New Guinea (elevations spanning 600 to at least
   3800 meters), including the mountain ranges of the Central Cordillera,
   the Huon Peninsula, and the North Coastal ranges. We diagnose and review
   12 species of Pseudohydromys, including six species described as new.
   The ne, v genus Mirzamys is erected to accommodate two newly described
   species of small terrestrial rodents from middle and upper montane
   forests and subalpine grassland edges (1900-3450 m) in the mountains of
   central New Guinea. Together these two new species represent a
   distinctive hydromyin lineage that resembles the terrestrial New Guinea
   hydromyin genera Pseudohydromys and Paraleptomys in various traits.
   Ecological attributes of all recognized moss-mice taxa, both previously
   and newly described, are reviewed in light of all information currently
   available about their biology.

AB Salmonellae are Gram-negative zoonotic bacteria that are frequently part
   of the normal reptilian gastrointestinal flora. The main objective of
   this project was to estimate the prevalence of non-typhoidal Salmonella
   enterica in the nesting and foraging populations of sea turtles on St.
   Kitts and in sand from known nesting beaches. Results suggest a higher
   prevalence of Salmonella in nesting leatherback sea turtles compared
   with foraging green and hawksbill sea turtles. Salmonella was cultured
   from 2/9 and identified by molecular diagnostic methods in 3/9
   leatherback sea turtle samples. Salmonella DNA was detected in one
   hawksbill turtle, but viable isolates were not recovered from any
   hawksbill sea turtles. No Salmonella was detected in green sea turtles.
   In samples collected from nesting beaches, Salmonella was only recovered
   from a single dry sand sample. All recovered isolates were positive for
   the wzx gene, consistent with the O:7 serogroup. Further serotyping
   characterized serovars Montevideo and Newport present in cloacal and
   sand samples. Repetitive-element palindromic PCR (rep-PCR) fingerprint
   analysis and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis of the 2014 isolates from
   turtles and sand as well as archived Salmonella isolates recovered from
   leatherback sea turtles in 2012 and 2013, identified two distinct
   genotypes and four different pulsotypes, respectively. The genotyping
   and serotyping were directly correlated. To determine the persistence of
   representative strains of each serotype/genotype in these environments,
   laboratory-controlled microcosm studies were performed in water and sand
   (dry and wet) incubated at 25 or 35 degrees C. Isolates persisted for at
   least 32 days in most microcosms, although there were significant
   decreases in culturable bacteria in several microcosms, with the
   greatest reduction in dry sand incubated at 35 degrees C. This
   information provides a better understanding of the epizootiology of
   Salmonella in free-ranging marine reptiles and the potential public
   health risks associated with human interactions with these animals in
   the Caribbean.

AB The small-scale fisheries sector in many Pacific islands is facing
   increasing challenges in relation to resource availability, economic
   opportunity, and demographic and social pressure. In particular,
   intensifying cash-oriented livelihood strategies can exacerbate existing
   vulnerabilities and threaten food security and resource conservation. In
   this paper the authors develop a bio-economic model and a quantitative
   measure of resilience in order to explore the interaction between
   socio-economic and ecological dynamics, and to analyze the potential
   role that cooperation and collective arrangements can play in this
   interaction to maintain the viability of the system. Based on the case
   of the system known as wantok typically found in the Solomon Islands,
   numerical examples are used to explore the potential gain that
   cooperation between fishers can bring in terms of subsistence,
   profitability and ecological performances, as well as the resilience of
   the whole system to shocks.

AB The Caribbean spiny lobster Panulirus argus is a valuable fishing
   resource and the trade in frozen lobster tails is an important industry.
   However, the presence of the pathogenic virus Panulirus argus Virus 1
   (PaV1), which causes systemic infection in P. argus and is particularly
   lethal to juvenile individuals, has not been previously examined in
   imported/exported lobster products. We used PCR assays to determine the
   presence of PaV1 in abdominal muscle tissue of 22 frozen P. argus tails
   exported from Belize to Mexico. Based on their size, the tails belonged
   to subadult-adult lobsters. Using specific primers targeted for PaV1
   resulted in 11 tails showing a specific 499 bp band. The sequence of
   positive amplified fragments showed a high similarity to PaV1 (95%
   identity with GenBank accession no. EF206313.1). Although the
   pathogenicity of PaV1 was not evaluated in the present study, our
   results provide the first evidence of PaV1 in frozen lobster tails
   exported in the seafood industry as well as the first molecular evidence
   of PaV1 in adult lobsters.

AB Since the 1800s the global average CO2 mixing ratio has increased and
   has been related to increases in surface air temperature (0.6 +/- 0.2
   degrees C) and variations in precipitation patterns among other weather
   and climatic variables. The Small Island Developing States (SIDS),
   according to the 2001 report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate
   Change (IPCC), are likely to be among the most seriously impacted
   regions on Earth by global climate changes. In this work, three climate
   change scenarios are investigated using the Parallel Climate Model (PCM)
   to study the impact of the global anthropogenic CO2 concentration
   increases on the Caribbean climate. A climatological analysis of the
   Caribbean seasonal climate variation was conducted employing the
   National Center for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) reanalysis data, the
   Xie-Arkin precipitation and the Reynolds-Smith Sea Surface Temperature
   (SST) observed data. The PCM is first evaluated to determine its ability
   to predict the present time Caribbean climatology. The PCM tends to
   under predict the SSTs, which along with the cold advection controls the
   rainfall variability. This seems to be a main source of bias considering
   the low model performance to predict rainfall activity over the Central
   and southern Caribbean. Future predictions indicate that feedback
   processes involving evolution of SST, cloud formation, and solar
   radiative interactions affect the rainfall annual variability simulated
   by PCM from 1996 to 2098. At the same time two large-scale indices, the
   Southern Oscillation Index (SOI) and the North Atlantic Oscillation
   (NAO) are strongly related with this rainfall annual variability. A
   future climatology from 2041 to 2058 is selected to observe the future
   Caribbean condition simulated by the PCM. It shows, during this
   climatology range, a future warming of approximately 1 degrees C (SSTs)
   along with an increase in the rain production during the Caribbean wet
   seasons (early and late rainfall seasons). Although the vertical wind
   shear is strengthened, it typically remains lower than 8 m/s, which
   along with SST > 26.5 degrees C provides favorable conditions for
   possible future increases in tropical storm frequency. Copyright (c)

AB A new genus and species of Nanaloricidae (Loricifera), Phoeniciloricus
   simplidigitatus, is described inhabiting fine sand covered by a layer of
   volcanic ash at a water depth of 1,813 m in the New Ireland Basin near
   the Kilinailau Trench (north of Papua New Guinea). The described
   specimen is a postlarva enclosed in a larval exuvium. This is the first
   report of a species belonging to the Nanaloricidae from the deep sea.
   This occurrence is surprising, because Nanaloricidae are typical
   inhabitants of coarse sands in the intertidal or littoral zone.
   Preference for these shallow water habitats is reflected in many
   morphological features which characterize the Nanaloricidae, and are not
   normally found in Loricifera inhabiting fine-grained, clayish, deep-sea
   bottoms. The postlarva of the new species is characterized by a long
   narrow mouth tube, an urn-shaped lorica divided into ten plates, and 13
   small lorica spikes. Distinguishing features of the Higgins-larva
   include short spinose toes lacking mucros but having small and slightly
   enlarged bases, short scalids on the introvert, many thoracic plates
   arranged in 6-8 rows, numerous small papillate flosculi in the collar
   and caudal regions, and three pairs of filiform, short locomotory
   appendages on the ventral side. Some features of the new species,
   especially of the Higgins-larva, are discussed as adaptations to the
   deep-sea environment.

AB Aim Islands and archipelagos have played an important role in the
   development of ecological and evolutionary theories. Using a newly
   compiled molecular phylogeny we infer the biogeographical history of a
   monarch flycatcher genus, Myiagra, which is distributed across the
   Indo-Pacific. We subsequently integrate biogeographical and
   ecomorphological data to examine the role of dispersal and trait
   evolution in the build-up of avian assemblages.
   Location Australia, the Moluccas, New Guinea and Pacific islands.
   Methods We generated a taxonomically densely sampled mitochondrial DNA
   dataset that included almost all species and subspecies of the
   reciprocally monophyletic genera Myiagra and Arses. We then used maximum
   likelihoood and Bayesian inference to infer their phylogenetic
   relationships. To reconstruct their biogeographical history, we first
   dated the tree topology and then used Lagrange to infer ancestral
   geographical areas. Finally, we combined ancestral area reconstructions
   with information on ecomorphological traits to infer mechanisms
   underlying community assembly.
   Results We provide the first comprehensive molecular phylogenetic
   reconstruction for Myiagra and Arses monarch flycatchers. Our
   phylogenetic reconstruction reveals a relatively recent diversification
   from the Miocene associated with several major dispersal events.
   Ancestral area reconstruction reveals several independent colonizations
   of the Moluccas, Melanesia, Fiji and the Micronesian islands. Ancestral
   state reconstruction of ecological traits suggests that the diversity of
   traits in co-occurring species of monarch flycatchers results from
   independent colonization events and ecological niche conservatism rather
   than in situ diversification.
   Main conclusions Three waves of colonization, non-overlapping in time,
   led to independent speciation events in the Bismarcks, Fiji and the
   Moluccas, in addition to in situ speciation events on remote islands of
   Micronesia, the Solomons, Vanuatu and Samoa. Few of these colonizations
   have led to the co-occurrence of congenerics or species with similar
   ecomorphological profiles on the same island. Thus, we suggest that
   priority effects might prevent new colonizers from establishing
   themselves if they share high levels of ecological similarity with
   resident species. We conclude that historical dispersal to and
   colonization of new islands, combined with ecologically deterministic
   priority effects, drove the assembly of insular monarch flycatcher
   communities across the Indo-Pacific.

AB Aim Members of the tropical tree snail family Partulidae are endemic to
   Pacific high oceanic islands and typically have single-island ranges.
   Two nominal Papua New Guinean species, Partula carteriensis and Partula
   similaris, deviate from familial norms by having extensive multi-island
   ranges that include low islands. We hypothesized that undocumented
   anthropogenic introductions may underlie this regional biogeographical
   anomaly and evaluated this hypothesis with novel field distributional
   and genotypic data.
   Location Papua New Guinean archipelagos between 1.4 and 11.4 degrees S
   and 146.5 and 154.2 degrees E.
   Methods Ethanol-preserved museum lots of P. carteriensis (from New
   Britain, Bismarck Archipelago) and P. similaris (from Woodlark,
   Boiaboiawaga and Goodenough islands) were genotyped for a standard
   mitochondrial marker, cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (COI), and the
   resulting haplotypes were subjected to phylogeographical analyses.
   Results All four genotyped populations showed very little genetic or
   conchological differentiation, irrespective of nominal taxonomic status,
   the archipelago sampled or whether the island was low, high, oceanic or
   continental. Partula carteriensis and P. similaris exhibit atypical
   distributions on larger high islands, being restricted to coastal
   villages and absent from native forest.
   Main conclusions Our results strongly indicate that P. carteriensis and
   P. similaris are conspecific, although a formal taxonomic revision is
   beyond the scope of this present study. They collectively exhibit the
   most heterogeneous geographical range known among partulids and their
   explicitly synanthropic association with high island coastal villages
   strongly implicates human introduction as the regional dispersal
   mechanism. We currently lack insights into the timeframe (apart from
   regional prehistory) and cultural context of these translocations. We
   also lack a convincing source population, and it may be necessary to
   survey the partulid fauna of the neighbouring Solomon Islands to
   identify one. Partulids are critically endangered throughout much of
   their range and the discovery of populations that apparently thrive in
   human-altered landscapes is noteworthy. Their study may provide clues of
   broad relevance to partulid conservation.

AB Sustainable management of groundwater resources to support food security
   under the potential effects of climate change is an emerging area of
   research and particularly relevant in the context of Small Island
   Developing States. Employing three regional downscaled Representative
   Connection Pathway (RCP 2.6, RCP4.5, and RCP 8.5) emission scenarios
   that have been linked to an economic evaluation framework, the potential
   impact of climate change on groundwater scarcity, economic value of
   groundwater irrigation, food security, and farming livelihoods is
   investigated. A nonlinear hydro-economic framework, which integrates
   groundwater hydrology, climate data, land use, economics and
   institutions, has been applied for the island of Barbados. Results
   indicate that climate change would intensify the dependency on
   groundwater irrigation overtime, modulated by climate intensity. The
   strength of climate change will boost the marginal value of groundwater
   irrigation, as food price will scale up, presenting negative impacts on
   food security and reducing farming livelihoods. The climate change would
   also result in higher cost of producing foods resulting from increased
   cost of pumping, mainly driven by the effect of meeting abstraction
   needs for domestic and municipal consumption. Our primary results show
   that for a small island, sustaining groundwater resources will be a
   challenging objective to achieve under severe climate change.

AB Currents of the equatorial Atlantic and Tethys Sea migrated westward
   through the Caribbean Sea and Panama seaway from Cretaceous to Oligocene
   time. At about 25 Ma currents reversed direction, allowing cool Pacific
   waters (Peruvian current) to enter the Caribbean. Almost coincident with
   the reversal was a dramatic increase in Central American explosive
   volcanism, which resulted in development of large volcanic centers, and
   an abundance of suspended volcanic detritus in Pacific and southern
   Caribbean waters. The detritus was transported by Pacific currents
   across the Caribbean to be deposited as pelagic mud in the Venezuelan
   Basin during 25 to 15 Ma. These cool, turbid Pacific waters led to a
   dramatic reduction in the diversity of hermatypic corals. At about 15 Ma
   Venezuelan Basin pelagic sediments record a dramatic change in
   provenance, with derivation of highly weathered detritus from the South
   American continent, probably the result of renewed uplift of the
   northern Andes. Exceptionally abundant kaolinite, reflected in high CIA
   values of the pelagic mud, indicates that materials of the Andean
   hinterlands suffered intense chemical weathering from at least 15 Ma to
   the present, with the most intense weathering occurring during Pliocene
   time. Weathering was somewhat less intense during the cool Pleistocene
   Period. These findings bear on Northern Hemisphere glaciation. With the
   Panama Seaway open, cool Pacific waters entered the Caribbean between 25
   and 12 Ma, and probably mixed with warm equatorial Atlantic waters to
   form the Gulf Stream. Closure of the seaway commenced about 12 Ma and
   finally closed about 3.5 Ma. This resulted in a warmer Gulf Stream,
   derived entirely from equatorial Atlantic waters. Dramatically increased
   pelagic sedimentation rates in the Venezuelan Basin since 4 Ma suggest
   intensification of the Atlantic equatorial current and strengthening of
   equatorial Atlantic summer storms (hurricanes), both of which
   strengthened the Gulf Stream current. Resultant northward heat transport
   by a warm, intensified Gulf Stream led to increased precipitation and
   promoted glaciation in the Northern Hemisphere.

AB We present demographic, social, historical and ecological data to
   challenge the generalization that traditional tenure and fishing taboos
   constitute cultural adaptations that evolved to prevent over-harvesting
   of subsistence fisheries in the Pacific. In particular, we re-examine
   the seminal and widely cited arguments of Johannes (Annual Review of
   Ecology and Systematics 1978; 9, 349364), which constructed tenure and
   taboos primarily as traditional fishery management tools for the entire
   Pacific region. While it is difficult to disprove Johannes logic for
   some sites, particularly in formerly densely populated parts of
   Polynesia and Micronesia, our review of data and literature for
   Melanesia indicate very different origins and functions for these
   institutions. Our study shows that human population densities in most of
   the Western Pacific prior to European colonial intrusions were too low
   to have generated sufficient fishing pressure to drive the evolution of
   a conservation ethic. Our review for Melanesia shows that customary
   marine tenure and fishing taboos are primarily designed to manage
   relationships between social groups, rather than to sustain food
   security from fisheries. We argue that proper recognition of the
   cultural role of tenure and taboos is critical to progressing marine
   resource management in Melanesia.

AB This study examined adaptive strategies of Huli-speaking migrants from
   the Tari Basin in the Southern Highlands Province to Port Moresby, the
   capital of Papua New Guinea. An interview survey of all migrant dwellers
   in two Huli communities, and time allocation and food consumption
   studies in their three primary settlements revealed that the subject
   households relied for their livelihood on a variety of activities in the
   informal sector (e. g., vending, small-scale retailing, moneylending,
   and chicken rearing) and jobs in the formal sector (e. g., driver,
   public servant, security guard, and storekeeper). Unexpectedly, the
   average income of households that exclusively depended on informal
   sector jobs was equivalent to, or higher than, that of households which
   included an employee in the formal sector. In addition, the average
   working hours were shorter in the former. Large interhousehold variation
   characterized the sample. The residential environment and composition of
   each household influenced economic strategies, which in turn determined
   the income, labor hours, and labor efficiency. However, food and
   nutrient intakes did not vary widely because leveling mechanisms among
   households, which are social norms in their homeland, still function in
   the urban settlements. The roles of settlements in Port Moresby are also
   discussed in relation to "urban problems" and rural-urban connections.

AB The poorly studied bat fauna of the Fiji Islands is of notable
   conservation importance because it includes one endemic species, several
   near endemics, and the best global populations of several threatened
   species. In addition, some of the species play a keystone role as
   pollinators and seed dispersers in valuable forest ecosystems. We
   visited 30 islands of the archipelago to survey bats and assess their
   conservation status and the potential threats to their continued
   existence. The Vulnerable Notopteris macdonaldi occurs on the three main
   islands but may only have nurseries on one of them. The Critically
   Endangered, endemic Mirimiri acrodonta appears to be restricted to a
   small montane area on a single island. Pteropus tonganus is consumed
   throughout rural Fiji but remains common and is not currently threatened
   by the harvest. The Near Threatened Pteropus samoensis is locally common
   on the largest islands but threatened on some smaller islands. The
   Endangered Chaerephon bregullae exists only on two islands and appears
   to concentrate in a single large colony to nurse young. The Endangered
   Emballonura semicaudata has declined dramatically in Fiji, as across
   most of its range, although a few substantial populations remain on some
   small islands. Factors threatening these species are variable but
   include small ranges, concentration in a reduced number of colonies,
   deforestation, over-harvesting, and introduced predators. We propose
   conservation measures and indicate a number of priority sites.

AB The El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) climate cycle is the basis for
   this paper, aimed at providing a diagnostic outlook on seasonal
   sea-level variability (i.e. anomalies with respect to the Climatology)
   for the U.S.-Affiliated Pacific Islands (USAPI).
   Results revealed that the sea-level variations in the northwestern
   tropical Pacific islands (e. g. Guam and Marshall Islands) have been
   found to be sensitive to ENSO-cycle, with low sea-level during El Nino
   and high sea-level during La Nina events. The annual cycle (first
   harmonic) of sea-level variability in these north Pacific islands has
   also been found to be very strong. The composites of SST and circulation
   diagnostic show that strong El Nino years feature stronger surface
   westerly winds in the equatorial western/central Pacific, which causes
   north Pacific islands to experience lower sea-level from July to
   December, while the sea-level in south Pacific islands (e. g. American
   Samoa) remains unchanged. As the season advances, the band of westerly
   winds propagates towards the south central tropical Pacific and moves
   eastward, which causes American Samoa to experience a lower sea-level
   from January to June, but with six months time lag as compared to Guam
   and the Marshalls. U.S.-Affiliated Pacific Islands are among the most
   vulnerable communities to climate variability and change. This study has
   identified the year-to-year ENSO climate cycle to have significant
   impact on the sea-level variability of these islands. Therefore, regular
   monitoring of the ENSO climate cycle features that affect seasonal
   sea-level variability would provide substantial opportunities to develop
   advance planning and decision options regarding hazard management in
   these islands.

AB The neotropical understory plant Heliconia hirsuta is notable for the

   species on inflorescences in a lowland forest in Trinidad, West Indies.
   The commonest of these in descending order were Ectatomma tuberculatum,
   Crematogaster sp., Solenopsis altinodis and Dolichoderus bispinosus. The
   ants collected exudate from the bracts, tended treehoppers
   (Membracidae), and nested on late-stage inflorescences, in addition to
   minor activities. Activity showed a distinct correlation with age of the
   inflorescence, with peak attendance in the middle developmental stages.
   The level of attendance by ants varied throughout the day. E.
   tuberculatum's alert responses to disturbance suggest that it may serve
   as an effective defender of Heliconia inflorescences against herbivores.

AB Sharks are charismatic predators that play a key role in most marine
   food webs. Their demonstrated vulnerability to exploitation has recently
   turned them into flagship species in ocean conservation. Yet, the
   assessment and monitoring of the distribution and abundance of such
   mobile species in marine environments remain challenging, often invasive
   and resource-intensive. Here we pilot a novel, rapid and non-invasive
   environmental DNA (eDNA) metabarcoding approach specifically targeted to
   infer shark presence, diversity and eDNA read abundance in tropical
   habitats. We identified at least 21 shark species, from both Caribbean
   and Pacific Coral Sea water samples, whose geographical patterns of
   diversity and read abundance coincide with geographical differences in
   levels of anthropogenic pressure and conservation effort. We demonstrate
   that eDNA metabarcoding can be effectively employed to study shark
   diversity. Further developments in this field have the potential to
   drastically enhance our ability to assess and monitor elusive oceanic
   predators, and lead to improved conservation strategies.

AB Aim To investigate patterns of genetic divergence between populations of
   the fruit bat genus Melonycteris Dobson 1877 in relation to the possible
   effects on dispersal of the geological history of water barriers within
   and between northern Melanesian archipelagos.
   Location The genus is found only in the Bismarck Archipelago and Solomon
   Islands of northern Melanesia.
   Methods Up to 935 aligned bases of cytochrome b and cytochrome c oxidase
   subunit I DNA sequences were determined for specimens of most species
   and subspecies of Melonycteris. Measures of genetic distance, analysis
   of molecular variation and phylogenetic investigations (using maximum
   parsimony, maximum likelihood and Bayesian approaches) were conducted to
   assess the evolutionary relationships amongst populations.
   Results The deepest divergences within Melonycteris separate the genus
   into two reciprocally monophyletic clades from first, the Bismarck
   Archipelago, and secondly, the Solomon Islands. Within the Solomon
   Islands, five major clades received strong support. Listed in a
   generally north-western to south-eastern direction these were: (1)
   specimens from Choiseul and Santa Isabel; (2) specimens from New Georgia
   and Kolombangara; (3) specimens from Malaita; (4) specimens from
   Guadalcanal; and (5) specimens from Makira. Outgroup rooting suggested
   that the clade from Makira was the most basal within the Solomon
   Islands, being shown as the sister group to all other Melonycteris from
   this archipelago.
   Main conclusions Patterns of genetic variation within Melonycteris were
   generally consistent, given current knowledge of northern Melanesian
   geological history, with the hypothesis that the dispersal of these
   fruit bats is strongly inhibited by water barriers. Within the Solomon
   Islands the main genetic clades were each restricted to a single island
   or to a group of islands that are thought to have belonged to larger
   landmasses (Greater Gatumbangara and Greater Bukida) formed by land
   bridges during the Pleistocene. The high genetic distance between
   specimens from the Bismarck Archipelago and from the Solomon Islands
   reflects the persistently large geographic distance between these
   archipelagos. The unexpected phylogenetic position of the Makira
   specimens suggests either that this island was the first colonized by
   Melonycteris in the Solomon Islands or that this population is the
   relict of a clade that was previously more widely distributed.

AB Aim The final island ontogeny of the general dynamic model (GDM) (i.e.,
   before island submergence) in tropical oceans corresponds to the coral
   atoll stage. Here, we examined whether the species richness of native
   vascular plants (indigenous and endemic species) on atolls is controlled
   by spatial and/or physical processes. We also predicted that atolls
   strongly affected by anthropogenic disturbance would have lower native
   species richness than predicted by spatial and physical processes.
   Location Marshall Islands, Kiribati Islands, Nauru, Niue, Johnston, Cook
   Islands, French Polynesia and Pitcairn Islands (Pacific Ocean). Taxon
   Native vascular plants. Methods We used stepwise regression to test the
   relative influence of five biogeographic variables on native species
   richness. Relationships were assessed for the full set of 111 Pacific
   coral atolls, as well as for atoll subsets ranging from 9 to 45 atolls.
   An index of human impact was then estimated, and residuals in the
   regression model predicting species richness from biogeographic
   variables were compared with the level of human impact. Results A
   regression model including atoll area, highest atoll elevation, the
   stepping stone distances from the nearest raised atoll and volcanic
   island explained native species richness on the 111 Pacific coral
   atolls. Regression models for different archipelagos and atoll subsets
   were also significant. Endemic species richness was significantly linked
   with highest atoll elevation and the stepping stone distances from the
   nearest raised atoll. Residuals in the biogeographic regression model
   were barely related to human impact across the 111 atolls but were
   significantly related to human impact in the Kiribati atolls. Main
   conclusions Native species richness on atolls is mainly controlled by
   physical and spatial characteristics. However, anthropogenic
   disturbances have altered the predicted pattern of native species
   richness leading to a lower model fit in some atoll subsets.

AB Benthic siphonophores of the family Rhodaliidae (Cnidaria, Hydrozoa) are
   extremely fragile, difficult to collect, and therefore little studied.
   Only a few records exist worldwide, so their ecology remains largely
   unknown. Rhodaliids have been found at most depth horizons, but until
   now were believed to mainly inhabit deeper water over continental
   shelves, with only a few records from ca. 100 m. In this paper, a new
   rhodaliid is described based on an underwater photograph provided by a
   recreational diver via Facebook. This observation was made in Milne Bay
   (Papua New Guinea) at a depth of 26-27 m, and constitutes the shallowest
   record so far for any rhodaliid. The specimen was tentatively identified
   as Archangelopsis typica based on observable morphological characters
   and an approximate estimate of connectivity between all rhodaliid
   species in the Indo-Pacific region. Additionally, we highlight the
   scientific potential of citizen science.

   zones of influence of gasohydrothermal flows were considered. Active
   photo- and chemosynthesis (up to 3 and 150 g of C per m3 per day,
   respectively) was detected in the pelagial, and joint going of these
   processes was noted in the surface layer of the bays. Development of
   bacterial and algal mats and accumulation of invertebrates was observed
   in the bottom vents zones saturated with hydrogen sulfide. Pogonophorans
   with methane oxidizing endosymbiotic bacteria were found it methane-rich
   gasohydrothermal vents at 60-degrees-C. The duration of gasohydrothermal
   activity and low water exchange determine the composition and density of
   populations of the communities.

AB Access to surgical care and emergency obstetrical care is limited in
   low-income countries. The Solomon Islands is one of the poorest
   countries in the Pacific region. Access to surgical care in Solomon
   Islands is limited and severely affected by a country made up of
   islands. Surgical care is centralized to the National Referral Hospital
   (NRH) on Guadalcanal, leaving a void of care in the provinces where more
   than 80% of the people live.
   To assess the ability to provide surgical care to the people living on
   outer islands in the Solomon Islands, the provincial hospitals were
   evaluated using the World Health Organization's Global Initiative for
   Emergency and Essential Surgical Care Needs Assessment Tool
   questionnaire. Data on infrastructure, workforce, and equipment
   available for treating surgical disease was collected at each provincial
   hospital visited.
   Surgical services are centralized to the NRH on Guadalcanal in Solomon
   Islands. Two provincial hospitals provide surgical care when a surgeon
   is available. Six of the hospitals evaluated provide only very basic
   surgical procedures. Infrastructure problems exist at every hospital
   including lack of running water, electricity, adequate diagnostic
   equipment, and surgical supplies. The number of surgeons and
   obstetricians employed by the Ministry of Health is currently inadequate
   for delivering care at the outer island hospitals.
   Shortages in the surgical workforce can be resolved in Solomon Islands
   with focused training of new graduates. Training surgeons locally, in
   the Pacific region, can minimize the "brain drain." Redistribution of
   surgeons and obstetricians to the provincial hospitals can be
   accomplished by creating supportive connections between these hospitals,
   the NRH, and international medical institutions.

AB Kubo producer-units (families and independent bachelors) could have been
   self-sufficient in the production of bananas but chose not to be. Nor
   did they seek self-sufficiency in the production of any combination of
   staple carbohydrate foods (bananas, tubers, sago flour) or, in the long
   term, strive for balance in the exchange of food with other
   producer-units. Despite the fact that bananas, which provided 50% of
   people's energy needs, were a delayed-return crop Kubo communities were
   very unstable. This instability and the failure to choose the option of
   self-sufficiency were connected and were mediated through intense
   intracommunity sharing that, ultimately, served to negotiate a concern
   with sorcery. The people grew bananas in the way they did, not out of
   environmental necessity, but to accommodate the crop to the needs of
   sharing and, thereby, facilitate community living.

AB Palm sage is an important staple food for populations living at low
   density, and on marginal lands in Papua New Guinea and elsewhere in
   Melanesia. The exploitation of palm sage is a highly efficient means of
   provisioning a community with dietary energy, but has been shown to be
   an energetically costly activity. However, a previous estimate of the
   energy cost of sage making was not based on the measurement of oxygen
   consumption, but on an indirect prediction of it, from estimates of
   energy expenditure at given heart rates obtained from another study in
   Papua New Guinea, and controlled for body weight. In this study, the
   energy expenditure in sage processing among a small group of Papuan
   women was determined using oxygen consumption measurements in the field
   and compared with estimates obtained by predicting from heart rate using
   regressions of heart-rate against energy expenditure obtained for each
   woman in the study, and obtained from literature values. The energy
   expended in adzing sage and making sage were shown to be similarly high
   by the oxygen consumption method, but in neither case as high as the
   value obtained by predicting from heart rate and energy expenditure
   values given in the literature. In this first report of energy
   expenditure in sage processing determined by direct measurements of
   oxygen consumption, energy expended in sage making is shown to be lower
   than previously estimated.

AB Australia's so-called "Dead Heart," its hot arid interior landscape, can
   be brought into irrigated agricultural production with the importation
   of extracontinental freshwater supplies originating in Papua New Guinea.
   Despite Queensland's La Nina-caused historic and costly 2010 to 2011
   river flooding induced, in great part by tropical cyclone Yasi, its
   westernmost torrid region is classed as arid, currently almost without
   any irrigation agriculture present. Freshwater importation from Papua
   New Guinea's Fly River via an undersea pipeline mostly skirting the
   Torres Strait could increase the value of Queensland's little-used
   dryland Outback and, perhaps, establish new overseas markets in Asia for
   exported agricultural products. An induced perennial Diamantina River
   could replenish groundwater recharge regions (Great Artesian Basin) and
   convert Lake Eyre to a permanent lake of slightly brackish water.
   Irrigated eucalyptus tree plantations might serve, in part, to counter
   some Earthly global warming. The Torres Strait Islanders will benefit
   economically as well as other social groups on the mainland of Papua New
   Guinea. Here we examine closely some of the technical aspects of a Papua
   New Guinea-Queensland (PNG-QLD) Undersea Freshwater Pipeline
   Macroproject (UFPM) installation. We offer a choice of two routings for
   the PNG-QLD UFPM (Case A) while at the same time making clear our
   informed preference.

AB Green sea turtles are common in West Central Africa, but little is known
   about the occurrence of immatures in foraging grounds in the Gulf of
   Guinea islands, known for their volcanic origin and narrow coastal
   fringes. This study presents results of in-water surveys in foraging
   grounds off Sao Tome Island, in the Sao Tome and Principe archipelago,
   providing the first available data on the size distribution of immature
   green sea turtles of different life-stage groups on these islands. Two
   sites offering distinct types of food sources were studied, and isotopic
   signatures of immature turtles hand-captured at each foraging site were
   used to infer (1) how long they were established at the foraging sites
   and (2) their diet preferences. Recruitment in the region was estimated
   to occur at a minimum size of 34 cm curved carapace length (CCL), and
   resident immature turtles ranged from 53 to 87 cm CCL. Immatures sampled
   at each site showed clear differences in isotopic signatures, suggesting
   that they establish specific home ranges related to the available diet
   items and use them for extended periods of at least several months.
   Macroalgae were as important as or more important than seagrasses for
   the turtles' diets, and there was evidence that these individuals are
   not strictly herbivorous. Our study provides the first dataset for
   comparison with demographic data from other locations in West Africa,
   where current knowledge on green turtle foraging behavior is limited,
   and indicates that even oceanic islands that are geologically recent
   like Sao Tome may provide important recruitment and development habitats
   for juvenile green turtles.

AB The acute salinity tolerance of three tropical freshwater cladoceran
   species, M. macleayi, C. rigaudii and D. brachyurum was determined. The
   existence of these species represented new records for Trinidad and
   Tobago, a tropical Caribbean island. It has a large oil based industry,
   in which, the primary effluent (saline produced water) is discharged
   directly into many freshwater systems. Cladoceran species are used
   routinely in temperate regions, to assess the impacts of chemicals and
   effluents in freshwater systems. However, relatively few studies have
   assessed the salinity tolerance of these organisms. Test organisms were
   assayed using seven salinity treatments (0, 1, 3, 5, 10, 15, 20, 25
   parts per thousand) prepared by volumetrically mixing natural filtered
   seawater with dilution water. C. rigaudii had a 48 h LC50 of 1.6 parts
   per thousand, M. macleayi 1.5 parts per thousand and D. brachyurum < 1
   parts per thousand. The CSmax (critical salinity maximum) for C.
   rigaudii and M. macleayi was 3 parts per thousand after 48 h, compared
   to 1 parts per thousand for D. brachyurum. There was no salinity value
   at which there was 100% survival. The resulting salinity response curve
   was a straight line which indicated that each species was intolerant of
   salt. Consequently, any of these can be considered as a representative
   freshwater organism for toxicity testing in Trinidad and Tobago.

AB White-lipped pythons (WLP) (Genus Leiopython) have been collected from
   the wild in Indonesian New Guinea and exported for the pet trade since
   at least 1977. Despite the long duration of trade and recent taxonomic
   work recognising six different species, virtually nothing is known of
   the trade dynamics or ecology of these species. Surveys of wildlife
   traders in Indonesian New Guinea and measurement of 122 WLP provides the
   first information on trade and ecological attributes of the two most
   commonly traded species, L. albertisii and L. hoserae. Both species
   exhibit broadly similar ecological attributes; however, L. hoserae has a
   longer and wider head than L. albertisii. WLP prey mainly on mammals,
   although smaller snakes were found to feed on lizards. Reproduction
   appears to be seasonal with oviposition and hatching occurring in the
   summer months between December and March. Most trade was in L.
   albertisii and although traders differentiated between the two species
   on the basis of colour, both were traded under the name L. albertisii.
   Examination of CITES export data revealed that in 2004 Indonesia
   exceeded the government-allocated harvest quota of wild individuals.
   Although this quota was apparently not exceeded in other years, the
   results of this study suggest that the unmonitored domestic pet trade
   and the potential for misdeclaration of wild-caught individuals for
   export may account for many more snakes than are recorded.

AB The Caribbean reef shark (Carcharhinus perezi), an abundant
   coral-reef-associated apex predator, is one of the most economically and
   ecologically important, yet least studied species of large shark in the
   greater Caribbean region. The relative abundance and population
   structure of C. perezi off Cape Eleuthera, The Bahamas, was surveyed by
   standardised longline surveys from May 2008 to October 2011, which
   resulted in the capture of 331 sharks. Abundance peaked in the summer
   and was lowest during the winter. Females were 1.6 times more abundant
   than males and the assemblage was dominated by immature female sharks
   (45.5 %). The abundance of mature male and female sharks peaked a month
   apart in June and August, respectively. All 331 sharks were tagged and
   released with 15.4 % being recaptured after periods at liberty between 5
   and 1,159 days (Mean = 333.4 +/- A 42.7 SE). The mean distance between
   tagging and recapture was 1.77 km for recaptures in excess of 6 months,
   indicating seasonally stratified philopatry in this species. C. perezi
   inhabiting Bahamian waters have developed complex habitat use patterns
   that are both spatiotemporally and demographically segregated, most
   probably in response to the large and diverse habitat mosaic available
   on the Bahamas Banks compared to contemporary study sites. This study
   represents an important step in understanding the spatiotemporal
   population structure of C. perezi and illustrates the potential for
   studies examining behavioural plasticity in response to environmental
   variation and anthropogenic disturbance.

AB The status of sawfishes (family Pristidae), and indeed most sharks and
   rays, in Papua New Guinea (PNG) is largely unknown due to the paucity of
   detailed catch and observational records available, both historic and
   contemporary. This paper provides the first comprehensive review of the
   published and unpublished literature on sawfish records in PNG. It also
   collates information for all sawfish specimens in the holdings of museum
   and fisheries collections, dating back to the late 1800s. Opportunistic
   sampling during a shark and ray biodiversity project in PNG has resulted
   in contemporary records for all 4 sawfish species known to occur in the
   region (i. e. Anoxypristis cuspidata, Pristis clavata, P. pristis and P.
   zijsron) and identification of suitable habitat for the species across
   PNG. A review of the literature shows that declines in sawfish
   populations have occurred in a number of locations. Detailed surveys of
   the key areas highlighted in this study are urgently required to assess
   the current status of sawfish in PNG. This information is crucial for
   developing a global strategy for sawfish conservation and fisheries
   management, given the apparent persistence of all 4 Indo-Pacific species
   in PNG.

   (Netherlands Antilles) and Hol Chan Marine Reserve (Ambergris Caye,
   Belize) in the Caribbean to assess differences between them and adjacent
   ecologically similar sites after 4 yr of protection from fishing.
   Forty-five percent of target species commonly recorded in visual
   censuses in Belize (23 % of all recorded target species), and 59 % at
   Saba (22 %), showed greater abundance, size or biomass in shallow
   protected sites. These differences are considered primarily to reflect
   increased survivorship with the cessation of fishing mortality. The
   greatest estimated biomasses were observed in locally protected snapper
   (Lutjanidae) in Belize and Saba, and grunt (Haemulidae) at Saba. In both
   protected areas the local stock of visible demersal target fishes was
   1.9 to 2.0 times greater in biomass and 2.2 to 3.5 times greater in
   commercial value than in fished sites. Larger local stock of many target
   species is likely to support higher egg output from the protected areas,
   while larger predator biomass will mean more intense predation at the
   protected sites.

   Zyzzya, Cornulella, Damiria, and Acheliderma are described from reef
   habitats off the coasts of Colombia, Bonaire and Curacao in the southern
   Caribbean.  With very few exceptions these sponges are small to tiny
   specimens inhabiting crevices and other cryptic habitats; some may be
   excavating.  For comparison both published and unpublished material
   belonging to these genera from other parts of the world was examined,
   and this yielded several nomenclatorial changes and a further three new
   species from the Indian Ocean.  The new species are:  Zyzzya invemar
   (Caribbean), Cornulella santamartae (Caribbean), C. tyro (Seychelles),
   C. amirantensis (Seychelles), Damiria leonorae (Caribbean), D. toxifera
   (Seychelles) and Archeliderma lisannae (Caribbean).  All species
   belonging to these genera, as well as to the closely related
   Indo-Pacific genus Paracornulum, are briefly diagnosed.  The genera and
   species of this group are found to be distributed over tropical and
   subtropical waters of all three oceans.  The five genera were so far of
   controversial systematic allocation, although their close relationship
   with Cornulum was generally accepted.  The recently revived family
   Iophonidae is demonstrated to be the likely assemblage for them.  A
   brief survey of Iophonidae genera is presented and a preliminary
   phylogenetic analysis of the fistular genera is attempted.  Although
   several parts of the phylogenetic relationships remain unsolved, it is
   nevertheless clear that in all genera the closest relatives are not
   found in adjacent areas, but are often disjunct.

AB In Japan, sweet potato is grown annually with the acreage of
   approximately 65,000 ha as of 1989.  It is utilized mostly for starch
   production and table use through the market.  Recent cultivars released
   from the breeding center have a wide range of utilizations not only in
   conventional use but also in food processing industry for high content
   of vitamins, low-amylase activity and extremely high starch content. 
   Germplasm collections at the breeding center include Japanese old local
   cultivars, breeding lines and introductions from China, Fiji, Indonesia,
   New Zealand, Papua New Guinea, the Philippines, Solomon Islands and
   U.S.A.  Total accessions of 1,200 were characterized and evaluated with
   their yielding abilities and degrees of resistance against pests and
   diseases.  Wild relatives of sweet potato were also introduced from
   Latin America.  The breeding program generally employs a usual crossing
   method, including combining ability tests.  Biotechnology works have
   recently been initiated, aiming at improvement of breeding efficacy. 
   Objectives of the breeding program are to raise productivity with a high
   starch content, pest and disease resistance, high quality for table use
   with better marketability and to develop new characteristics which
   facilitate greater utilization in food processing industry with a large
   scale.

   goals, strategies, and outcomes of each project and what we can learn
   from these efforts to guide future implementation and assessment. In
   particular, we focus on how projects dealt with the challenges of
   working across geographic scales and diverse governance arrangements.
   While we hypothesized that EBM in the United States would be distinct
   from EBM in developing countries due to differences in social and
   political factors, we found that sites faced similar challenges.
   Variation among sites appeared to be more closely related to the
   preexisting management context and the scale at which the projects began
   rather than to clear differences between the United States and
   developing country contexts. EBM project implementers were able to
   overcome many of these challenges by focusing on a limited number of
   specific objectives, starting at a small scale, pursuing adaptive
   management, and monitoring a diverse set of indicators. These findings
   are directly relevant to current and future EBM efforts in these and
   other places.

   the Isle of Lewis, a trawler, the Carella, passed through the danger
   area when a toxic cloud had been released and was covertly watched until
   the incubation period had passed in case those on board had come into
   contact with the plague bacillus. Publicity about the trials was
   avoided, but a press statement was issued in March 1954. The last series
   provoked sustained agitation in Cuba. More recently an outline of the
   sequence has emerged in the UK parliamentary record and in Porton's
   official history, and a fuller account of the Scottish trials has
   awakened some interest locally.

AB Aim Long Island erupted catastrophically in c. 1645:with the probable
   destruction of its entire biota. While several expeditions have visited
   the island since, no survey of its flora has been published. In 1,968 a
   small island, Motmot, emerged from its caldera lake. Motmot has been
   surveyed several times but riot since 1988. The aim of this study was to
   investigate the colonization by vascular plants of this interesting
   nested pair of islands.
   Location Long Island is 55 km off the northeast coast of Papua New
   Guinea (PNG) and Motmot lies in its fresh water caldera lake, Lake
   Wisdom, c. 4 km from the rim of the surrounding volcano.
   Methods We conducted a complete survey of the vascular plants on Motmot
   and made ad hoc collections on Long Island, including surveying three
   small plots, over 15 days in 1999. In addition, we incorporated data
   from several collections lodged at the regional herbarium in Lae. Data
   on seed dispersal syndromes and plant habit were obtained from the
   literature.
   Results We recorded 305 species of vascular plants from Long Island, but
   most trees were small and the species diversity was low. Motmot was
   still very sparsely vegetated and only forty-five species of vascular
   plants were found. Communities on Motmot were unspecialized and common
   species widespread. The flora of Motmot was not significantly different
   from that on Long Island in terms of the number of species amongst
   higher taxa, seed dispersal syndromes or plant habits.
   Main conclusions Low rainfall combined with very porous soils may be
   responsible for the small stature and low diversity of the forest on
   Long Island's caldera rim. The absence of specialist littoral species on
   Motmot, as a result of its landlocked situation, is probably responsible
   for the very slow species recruitment on the island. This community
   appears to be functionally important for colonization by comparison with
   other small volcanic islands in a marine situation.

AB The spotted eagle ray is an iconic species for the recreational diving
   and snorkeling industry in the Mexican Caribbean although it is heavily
   fished in nearby waters of the southern Gulf of Mexico and in Cuba. This
   species is listed on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species as 'Near
   Threatened' with a decreasing population trend. Few studies have
   reported on the populations and migrations of spotted eagle rays in the
   Atlantic Ocean, Gulf of Mexico and Caribbean Sea, and no regulations
   currently exist for the fishery or tourism industries in Mexico.
   Photographic identification techniques were used to produce the first
   photo-ID catalog of spotted eagle rays in the Mexican Caribbean using
   1096 photographs submitted by researchers and divers between 2003 and
   2016. In total, 282 individual spotted eagle rays were identified
   through photographs at nine sites across the Mexican Caribbean. Of these
   individuals, 14.9% were resighted at least once at the same site. The
   longest period between re-sighting events was 342 days. This is the
   first study evaluating free-swimming spotted eagle rays in the Mexican
   Caribbean and highlights the value of using photo-ID for monitoring
   populations of this ray. Because a targeted subsistence fishery for
   spotted eagle rays exists in nearby waters, management efforts to
   monitor and prevent overexploitation at key diving locations should be a
   priority for local government agencies.

   outflow and delta of the Rewa River, Fiji's largest and longest river.
   The river originates on the eastern slopes of Mt. Tomaniivi in the
   Central Highlands of Viti Levu. The island has been selected as an
   integral coastal site for Fiji's PABITRA Gateway Transect. Information
   is provided on: (1) the reasons it was selected as a PABITRA site; (2)
   geographical, geological, climatic, and edaphic setting, (3) the
   vegetation; and (4) brief notes on the fauna, with particular focus on
   the avifauna. Because of its rich flora and fauna, Nasoata Island is an
   excellent "prototype" coastal and mangrove site for enhancing our
   understanding of the complexities of island biodiversity, both within
   Fiji and in relation to other small offshore islands within the broader
   PABITRA network.

   New Guinea, Australia, New Caledonia, California, the west coast of
   Canada, and the Red Sea. The previous synonymy of Micropodarke amemiyai

   trilobata Hartmann-Schroder, 1983 is newly synonymized with M. dubia,
   leaving Micropodarke monotypic. A lectotype is selected for M. dubia.
   Micropodarke dubia is identified by the apomorphies of a proboscis
   diaphragm, segmental ventral adhesive papillae, distally nobbed and
   slightly curved neuroaciculae, and median neurouchaetae with few,
   basally situated prolonged teeth ("spurs"), with abrupt transition to
   the following, much shorter teeth. Micropodarke dubia has a main
   distribution in the tropical and warm temperate Indo-Pacific region, and
   appears to be absent from the Atlantic Ocean.

AB The western equatorial Pacific warm pool is believed to be the source
   region of a substantial proportion of the world's inter-annual climate
   variability, including the globally significant El Nino-Southern
   Oscillation. Here new data are presented on changes in the climate of
   this region over the past 70 yr, based on analysis of the stable oxygen
   isotopic composition of annually banded, massive corals living on the
   north coast of Papua New Guinea. In this area, the coincidence of
   abundant and isotopically light rainfall with small seasonal and
   inter-annual changes in temperature means that the coral skeletal
   delta(18)O record may be reliably interpreted in terms of rainfall
   variation. Since the abundance of rainfall is governed by the intensity
   of deep atmospheric convection, the coral records provide regionally
   significant, and regionally reproducible, climatic indices. In
   particular, the coral records indicate larger changes in the degree of
   coupling of the climate of the region with the Southern Oscillation than
   have hitherto been described. These changes in coupling, which accompany
   shifts in the dominant periodicities of inter-annual climate variation,
   are indicative of rapid and large-scale reorganisation of
   ocean-atmosphere interactions. The data indicate that from the 1920s to
   1950s the western equatorial Pacific was less important in modulating
   Pacific and global inter-annual climatic variability than it has
   appeared to be subsequently. The reproducibility of the coral climate
   records, combined with the presence on the north coast of Papua New
   Guinea of extensive and well preserved raised reef terraces, leads to
   the potential for extending understanding of climatic variability in
   this globally important region back into the late Quaternary.

AB Most commercially grown produce in the Caribbean is cultivated from
   imported hybrid seeds. Consumers' preferential demand has caused
   traditional indigenous vegetables to be edged out by these exotic
   varieties. In this study, we investigated the patterns of Amaranth (an
   indigenous vegetable) consumption in Trinidad and Tobago. A structured
   survey was used to capture information from 678 residents (58% women,
   63% aged 21 to 40 years) about current consumption, awareness of
   nutritional and other benefits, and possible increased future
   consumption under different circumstances. Most (96%) were aware of
   amaranth but fewer (66%) of its nutritional value. Only 41%, however,
   reported consuming it regularly. Still, 80% liked its taste and 78%
   found it easy to prepare. Chi Square tests revealed significant
   correlations between some demographics and amaranth use. Exploratory
   factor analysis of a scale on potential consumption of amaranth yielded
   two latent multidimensional components. Statistical tests (t and ANOVA)
   of demographic impacts on these factors estimated that income class does
   not influence use; men and younger people are more conscious of
   Amaranth's diet potential and taste; older people, afro-Trinidadians and
   those identifying as Christians would consume more amaranth because of
   its nutrient benefits and if packaged conveniently, with good storage
   properties.

AB The sea urchin Tripneustes ventricosus is a common, yet relatively
   poorly known, grazer of seagrass beds and coral reefs throughout the
   Caribbean. We compared the size and abundance of urchins between
   adjacent seagrass and coral reef habitats (where macroalgae are the
   dominant primary producers). We also conducted a laboratory experiment
   comparing the growth rate of juvenile urchins fed a diet of either
   macroalgae or seagrass. Reef urchins had significantly larger test
   diameter than those in the seagrass on some sampling dates. This size
   difference may be at least partially explained by diet, because
   laboratory-reared urchins fed macroalgae grew significantly faster than
   those fed seagrass. The seagrass population, however, was stable over
   time, whereas the reef population exhibited strong fluctuations in
   abundance. Overall, our study indicates that both the seagrass and coral
   reef habitats are capable of supporting healthy, reproductive
   populations of T. ventricosus. Each, however, appears to offer a
   distinct advantage: faster growth on the reef and greater population
   stability in the seagrass.

AB Wotje Atoll is located at 9 degrees 25'N and 170 degrees 04'E within the
   Republic of the Marshall Islands in the central Pacific Ocean. As on
   other atolls, the islands perched along the rim of Wotje are low-lying
   and considered highly vulnerable to the impacts of climate change. A
   widely anticipated impact of continued sea level rise is the chronic
   erosion of island shorelines. Using a combination of aerial photographs
   and satellite imagery shoreline changes are assessed over a 67-year
   period characterized by rising sea level. Results indicate that between
   1945 and 2010 shoreline accretion is more prevalent than erosion, with
   an average Net Shoreline Movement (NSM) of + 1.74 m, indicating
   accretion. Shorelines were accretionary along the lagoon, ocean and
   channel facing shorelines, as well as on elongate spits and small
   islands. A high-frequency assessment of shoreline change on a subset of
   islands in the east of Wotje reveals that islands were stable, with a
   balance between shoreline accretion and erosion. Shorelines interpreted
   from high resolution satellite imagery captured between 2004 and 2012
   indicate that shorelines within this sample of islands are largely in an
   erosive state. The post-2004 shift toward erosion may be sea level rise
   induced, or part of an unresolved shoreline oscillation. This study
   demonstrates the critical need for improved shoreline change monitoring
   within atoll settings in order to assess sea level rise impacts along
   island shorelines. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Cuba is an ecological rarity in Latin America and the Caribbean region.
   Its complex political and economic history shows limited disturbances,
   extinctions, pollution, and resource depletion by legal or de facto
   measures. Vast mangroves, wetlands, and forests play key roles in
   protecting biodiversity and reducing risks of hazards caused or
   aggravated by climate change. Cuba boasts coral reefs with some of the
   region's greatest fish biomass and coral cover. Although it has set
   aside major protected areas that safeguard a host of endemic species,
   Cuba's environment is by no means pristine. Through much of its early
   history, deforestation and intensive agricultural production under
   colonial then neocolonial powers was the norm. Using remote sensing, we
   find Cuba's land today is 45% devoted to agricultural, pasturage, and
   crop production. Roughly 77% of Cuba's potential mangrove zone is
   presently in mangrove cover, much of it outside legal protection; this
   is likely the most intact Caribbean mangrove ecosystem and an important
   resource for coastal protection, fish nurseries, and wildlife habitat.
   Even the largest watersheds with the most agricultural land uses have a
   strong presence of forests, mangroves, and wetlands to buffer and filter
   runoff. This landscape could change with Cuba's gradual reopening to
   foreign investment and growing popularity among tourists- trends that
   have devastated natural ecosystems throughout the Caribbean. Cuba is
   uniquely positioned to avoid and reverse ecosystem collapse if
   discontinuities between geopolitical and ecosystem functional units are
   addressed, if protection and conservation of endemic species and
   ecosystems services accompany new development, and if a sound
   ecological-restoration plan is enacted.

AB Global climate change is an important cause of biodiversity loss. The
   conservation, sustainable management and use of biodiversity resources
   are key factors that can be effectively used to minimize the adverse
   impacts of global climate change. Efforts to understand and address the
   linkages between global climate change and biodiversity loss are both
   urgent and timely.
   Integrating responses related to these two global environmental
   challenges is especially relevant for small island developing States
   (SIDS) because the adverse impacts of climate change can impose severe
   stresses on biodiversity resources that are fragile, vulnerable and
   already under stress and the people who depend upon them. This paper
   argues that comprehensive assessments of adverse impacts of global
   climate change on the biodiversity resources of SIDS, and an improved
   understanding of relevant climate change related adaptation measures and
   sustainable energy policies (that are based on the principles of
   conservation, sustainable management and use of biodiversity resources)
   will enable SIDS to become more resilient and to develop better response
   capacities.

AB The Nd isotopic composition (IC) and Rare Earth patterns of hydrodynamic
   structures of the Equatorial Pacific Ocean were characterized along 140
   degreesW. The Nd IC of Antarctic Intermediate Water (AAIW) and of the
   lower layer of the Equatorial Undercurrent (EUC) at 140 degreesW (13
   degreesC Water) are much more radiogenic at the equator than at their
   origin in the South Equatorial Current (12 degreesS), revealing that
   these water masses have been in contact with the highly radiogenic Papua
   New Guinea (PNS) slope. In both cases, only a small fraction (less than
   9%) of the sediment deposited on the PNG slope is required to be
   exchanged or dissolved to explain these Nd TC variations, whereas the
   hydrographic properties of the same water masses remain unchanged. This
   confirms the usefulness of this tracer to identify pathways of water
   masses. These results emphasize the importance of jets in transporting
   lithogenic material into the subsurface layers of remote areas, where
   aeolian inputs are particularly weak and corroborate the previous
   results on Fe and Al maximum in this area [M.L. Wells, G.K. Vallis, E.A.
   Silver, Nature 398 (1999) 601-604]. The Nd IC of the upper layer of the
   EUC contrasts strongly to that of the subpycnocline layer, indicating
   that the equatorial upwelling only affects the surface waters and is not
   effective between 120 and 150 m. We calculate that the Nd imprint of the
   PNG input is likely to vanish from this surface layer as it traverses
   the basin, due to the replacement of upwelled waters by non-radiogenic
   ones, (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB On April 2nd, 2007 a 12 m tsunami struck Simbo, a relatively remote
   island in Western Province, Solomon Islands. Although Simbo's population
   continues to depend on their own food production and small-scale
   governance regimes regulate access to resources, the island's way of
   life over the last century has increasingly been affected by processes
   associated with globalization. In this context of a rapidly globalizing
   world, this article examines the island's resilience and vulnerability
   to the tsunami and the adaptive capacities that enabled the response and
   recovery. The tsunami completely destroyed two villages and damaged
   fringing coral reefs, but casualties were low and social-ecological
   rebound relatively brisk. By combining social science methods (household
   surveys, focus group and ethnographic interviews) and underwater reef
   surveys we identify a number of countervailing challenges and
   opportunities presented by globalization that both nurture and suppress
   the island's resilience to high amplitude, low-frequency disturbances
   like tsunamis. Analysis suggests that certain adaptive capacities that
   sustain general system resilience come at the cost of more vulnerability
   to low-probability hazards. We discuss how communities undergoing
   increasingly complex processes of change must negotiate these kinds of
   trade-offs as they manage resilience at multiple spatial and temporal
   scales. Understanding the shifting dynamics of resilience may be
   critical for Pacific Island communities who seek to leverage
   globalization in their favor as they adapt to current social-ecological
   change and prepare for future large-scale ecological disturbances. (C)

AB Sustainably feeding the world's growing population represents one of our
   most significant challenges. Aquaculture is well positioned to make
   contributions towards this challenge. Yet, the translation of
   aquaculture production innovations into benefits for rural communities
   is constrained by a limited understanding of the social dynamics that
   influence the adoption of new agricultural practices. In this paper, we
   investigate the factors that shape the spread of small-scale tilapia
   aquaculture through rural Solomon Islands. Based on diffusion of
   innovation theory, we focus on three potentially influential factors:
   (i) socio-economic characteristics of adopters; (ii) the role of opinion
   leaders; and (iii) characteristics of the innovation. We find that
   farmers who were wealthier, older, and had more diverse livelihoods were
   most likely to be adopters. Opinion leaders facilitated the adoption of
   tilapia aquaculture, but lacked the capacity to provide fundamental
   knowledge necessary to realize its potential benefits to food security.
   The paper argues for more explicit attention to the poorest households
   and makes the case for a deeper engagement with the broader social and
   institutional contexts that shape the adoption process. Aquaculture
   interventions that account for these social dynamics are critical for
   translating production innovations into sustainable benefits to rural
   communities.

AB Exploration of the deep ocean (>200m) is taking on added importance as
   human development encroaches. Despite increasing oil and natural gas
   exploration and exploitation, the deep ocean of Trinidad and Tobago is
   almost entirely unknown. The only scientific team to image the deep
   seafloor within the Trinidad and Tobago Exclusive Economic Zone was from
   IFREMER in the 1980s. That exploration led to the discovery of the El
   Pilar methane seeps and associated chemosynthetic communities on the
   accretionary prism to the east of Trinidad and Tobago. In 2014, the EN
   Nautilus, in collaboration with local scientists, visited two previously
   sampled as well as two unexplored areas of the El Pilar site between 998
   and 1,629 m depth using remotely operated vehicles. Eighty-three
   megafaunal morphospecies from extensive chemosynthetic communities
   surrounding active methane seepage were observed at four sites. These
   communities were dominated by megafaunal invertebrates including mussels
   (Bathymodiolus childressi), shrimp (Alvinocaris cf. muricola),
   Lamellibrachia sp. 2 tubeworms, and Pachycara caribbaeum. Adjacent to
   areas of active seepage was an ecotone of suspension feeders including
   Haplosclerida sponges, stylasterids and Neovermilia serpulids on
   authigenic carbonates. Beyond this were large Bathymodiolus shell
   middens. Finally there was either a zone of sparse octocorals and other
   nonchemosynthetic species likely benefiting from the carbonate
   substratum and enriched production within the seep habitat, or
   sedimented inactive areas. This paper highlights these ecologically
   significant areas and increases the knowledge of the biodiversity of the
   Trinidad and Tobago deep ocean. Because methane seepage and
   chemosynthetic communities are related to the presence of extractable
   oil and gas resources, development of best practices for the
   conservation of biodiversity in Trinidad and Tobago waters within the
   context of energy extraction is critical. Potential impacts on benthic
   communities during oil and gas activities will likely be long lasting
   and include physical disturbance during drilling among others.
   Recommendations for the stewardship of these widespread habitats
   include: (1) seeking international cooperation; (2) holding wider
   stakeholder discussions; (3) adopting stringent environmental
   regulations; and (4) increasing deep-sea research to gather crucial
   baseline data in order to conduct appropriate marine spatial planning
   with the creation of marine protected areas.

AB The paper considers the influence of the geographical position and local
   conditions on the structure and abundance of symbiotic communities (SCs)
   associated with the crinoid Himerometra robustipinna. Two water areas at
   the coast of Vietnam (Nhatrang Bay and the Anthoy Archipelago; our
   data), Hansa Bay (Papua, New Guinea; Deyen et al., 2006), and the Great
   Barrier Reef (Australia; Fabricius and Dale, 1993) were compared. We
   found a similarity in the contribution from the main taxa to the
   structure of SCs between geographically distant water areas-Nhatrang
   Bay, Hansa Bay, and the Great Barrier Reef (GBR)-and strong differences
   between the two Vietnamese water areas. A possible reason for the
   differences in the SC structure in these water areas is not their
   geographical location, but the environmental conditions, which are more
   stable in the seaward part of Nhatrang Bay and less stable in the Anthoy
   Archipelago. The abundances of symbionts in the water areas of the coast
   of Vietnam are similar to each other and strongly different from Hansa
   Bay and the GBR. We suppose that a factor regulating the abundance of
   symbionts is their consumption by predatory fishes. A low abundance of
   fishes in the area of active coastal fishery (the coast of Vietnam)
   makes possible the existence of SCs with a high abundance. In Hansa Bay
   and the GBR where fishery pressure is low, a high number of predators
   leads to a low abundance of symbionts.

AB Studying the temporal variability of lower trophic levels allows a
   better understanding of the type and degree of coupling that exists in
   the pelagic ecosystem in the Caribbean region. The aim of the present
   study was to characterize the structure and functioning of the <20 mu m
   planktonic fractions in oligotrophic oceanic waters of Cuba and their
   relation with environmental parameters, as well as the role played by
   heterotrophic components in the microbial loop in the pelagic ecosystem.
   The distribution of picoplanktonic and nanoplanktonic biomass in the
   oceanic waters of Cuba did not differ significantly among years in the
   same season. The highest biomass values were found in the northern vs
   the southern region, which may be related to coastal upwelling, as well
   as to the contributions of nutrients and organic matter from coastal
   ecosystems. Furthermore, the biomass of the heterotrophic component was
   much larger than that of the autotrophic component, confirming the role
   played by small (<20 mu m) heterotrophic organisms in the microbial
   loop. The present findings may be useful for tracking future variation
   in bacterioplankton and phytoplankton in the Caribbean region.

AB The proposed interoceanic canal will connect the Caribbean Sea with the
   Pacific Ocean, traversing Lake Nicaragua, the major freshwater reservoir
   in Central America. If completed, the canal would be the largest
   infrastructure-related excavation project on Earth. In November 2015,
   the Nicaraguan government approved an environmental and social impact
   assessment (ESIA) for the canal. A group of international experts
   participated in a workshop organized by the Academy of Sciences of
   Nicaragua to review this ESIA. The group concluded that the ESIA does
   not meet international standards; essential information is lacking
   regarding the potential impacts on the lake, freshwater and marine
   environments, and biodiversity. The ESIA presents an inadequate
   assessment of natural hazards and socioeconomic disruptions. The panel
   recommends that work on the canal project be suspended until an
   appropriate ESIA is completed. The project should be resumed only if it
   is demonstrated to be economically feasible, environmentally acceptable,
   and socially beneficial.

AB Foraminiferal communities are not static, but change in response to
   environmental perturbations. Given sufficient time, the change will be
   recorded in the total (live+dead) seafloor assemblage, from which
   valuable information regarding environmental trends can be obtained by
   re-sampling assemblages at the decadal scale.
   The seafloor assemblage in the 5 km x 6 km Ibis Field, off southeast
   Trinidad, first surveyed in 1953, was re-examined in 2005. The fauna had
   changed markedly between the surveys. Overall increases in the
   proportional abundances of Uvigerina subperegrina, Ammonia
   pauciloculatal Rolhausenia rolhauseni and Pseudononion attanticum
   indicate an increase in nutrient supply that apparently killed off
   Cibicidoides pseudoungerianus and Miliolinella subrotunda, and reduced
   the relative abundance of Hanzawaia concentrica, but did not affect the
   relative abundance of Cancris sagrai. As shown by similar 1953 and 2005
   planktonic/benthonic foraminiferal ratios, the increased nutrient supply
   impacted on both surface and bottom waters.
   Of the six most abundant species in 2005, five showed the same general
   biogeographical distributions within the field in 1953 and 2005.
   However, whereas the proportional abundance of Uvigerina subperegrina in
   1953 increased southwards, in 2005 it increased northwards.
   Trinidad cannot be the source for the nutrient enrichment: the island
   lies down-current from the Ibis Field. Sources must therefore be sought
   up-current and to the southeast, in the Amazon, Essequibo and Orinoco
   river basins, or along the South American shoreline. It is speculated
   that the nutrient enrichment may be a consequence of increased
   phytoplankton primary production associated with nitrogen-rich run-off
   from South American sugarcane plantations, or from flushing of organic
   carbon from poorly regulated sewage systems or shrimp farms in South
   America.

   Billy Mitchell [1,013 m above sea level (a.s.l.), 88.3 m depth, 3 km(2)
   surface area] in central Bougainville Island, Papua New Guinea.
   Physicochemical depth profiles indicated mixis of the entire water body
   with oxygen saturation reaching 55% in the deepest layers. A shallow
   thermocline was eroded at night, indicating atelomixis. HCO3-, Cl-,
   SO42- and Na+, Ca2+, Mg2+ were the dominant anions and cations,
   respectively, leading to a conductivity of around 1,230 mu S cm(-1). The
   pH was close to neutral throughout the water column, and no accumulation
   of CO2 was observed at greater depths. With a total phosphorus
   concentration of around 25 mu g liter(-1) the lake can be considered as
   meso- to eutrophic. The phytoplankton community consisted of 18 taxa.
   The dinophyte Peridiniopsis cf. penardii and the filamentous green alga
   Planctonema lauterbornii dominated in the uppermost layer and reached a
   total biovolume around 16 mm(3) liter(-1). Six macrophyte taxa were
   found (three Spermatophyta/three Bryophyta), with the water chestnut
   Eleocharis dulcis covering the shoreline and Ceratophyllum demersum
   spreading to at least 3 m depth. Seven ciliate species were detected (<5
   individuals ml(-1)) with bacterivorous scuticociliates and the
   prostomatid Coleps hirtus hirtus dominating the assemblage. The
   micrometazoan plankton community comprised the rotifer Anuraeopsis
   fissa, the copepod Mesocyclops cf. affinis, and a cladoceran species
   within the Ceriodaphnia cornuta group all concentrating in the upper
   water column. The only fish species found in the lake was the eel
   Anguilla megastoma, whereas in the effluent river this species occurred
   together with Anguilla marmorata.

AB OBJECTIVE: Pacific Island countries are experiencing a high burden of
   diet-related non-communicable diseases; and consumption of fat, sugar
   and salt are important modifiable risk factors contributing to this. The
   present study systematically reviewed and summarized available
   literature on dietary intakes of fat, sugar and salt in the Pacific
   Islands.
   DESIGN: Electronic databases (PubMed, Scopus, ScienceDirect and
   GlobalHealth) were searched from 2005 to January 2018. Grey literature
   was also searched and key stakeholders were consulted for additional
   information. Study eligibility was assessed by two authors and quality
   was evaluated using a modified tool for assessing dietary intake
   studies.
   RESULTS: Thirty-one studies were included, twenty-two contained
   information on fat, seventeen on sugar and fourteen on salt. Dietary
   assessment methods varied widely and six different outcome measures for
   fat, sugar and salt intake - absolute intake, household expenditure,
   percentage contribution to energy intake, sources, availability and
   dietary behaviours - were used. Absolute intake of fat ranged from 25·4
   g/d in Solomon Islands to 98·9 g/d in Guam, while salt intake ranged
   from 5·6 g/d in Kiribati to 10·3 g/d in Fiji. Only Guam reported on
   absolute sugar intake (47·3 g/d). Peer-reviewed research studies used
   higher-quality dietary assessment methods, while reports from national
   surveys had better participation rates but mostly utilized indirect
   methods to quantify intake.
   CONCLUSIONS: Despite the established and growing crisis of diet-related
   diseases in the Pacific, there is inadequate evidence about what Pacific
   Islanders are eating. Pacific Island countries need nutrition monitoring
   systems to fully understand the changing diets of Pacific Islanders and
   inform effective policy interventions.

AB Satellite-derived sea surface temperature data from the MODIS Aqua
   instrument were used to project rates of growth for four Gambierdiscus
   and one Fukuyoa species, dinoflagellates associated with ciguatera fish
   poisoning. Dinoflagellate growth rates were modelled using experimental
   temperature vs. growth equations and projected bottom temperatures with
   light penetration and bathymetry masks. Daily projected growth rates for
   each species were used to calculate monthly, yearly and multiyear
   averages between 2003 and 2013. The resulting projections were then used
   to characterize patterns of regional Gambierdiscus/Fukuyoa abundance and
   compare these to ciguatera fish poisoning incidences in the Greater
   Caribbean Region. Model output indicated the highest growth potential
   was in the shelf waters of the Caribbean Sea, with moderate growth in
   the Bahamas, southern Florida and Gulf of Mexico; the lowest growth
   potential was in the northern Gulf of Mexico and along the U.S. south
   Atlantic coast. Mean projected growth rates generally coincided with
   distribution of ciguatera fish poisoning incidences in the region, with
   some exceptions in the southwestern Caribbean. The results of this study
   indicate spatial differences in Gambierdiscus and Fukuyoa growth likely
   play a prominent role in governing the occurrence of ciguatera fish
   poisoning in the greater Caribbean. Growth and distribution models may
   be an effective tool for ciguatera risk assessment. Published by

AB Hemidactylus geckos are probably the most widespread genus of reptiles,
   with a world-wide distribution and multiple cases of range expansion and
   transmarine colonization. With an almost cosmopolitan distribution and
   many species being morphologically similar it has proved difficult to
   delimit species diversity and distributions. Using a comprehensive
   analysis of individuals collected across the Western Indian Ocean
   islands and some locations along the East African coast, we further
   assess their diversity and the origin of insular populations. Despite
   four species of Hemidactylus being widespread across the Western Indian
   Ocean islands, most of their range in this area may actually be the
   result of very recent (possibly human-aided) dispersal events. Most
   probably, all Hemidactylus species occurring in the Comoros and granitic
   Seychelles archipelagoes are not native. Instances of natural
   colonization seem to be only the ones of H. mabouia to Madagascar and
   from there to the coralline archipelago of Aldabra. Surprisingly,
   Aldabra populations reveal a remarkable diversity and structure. Given
   the degree of divergence observed we propose that insular (Gulf of
   Guinea, Comoros, Madagascar, Seychelles) populations of H. mabouia are
   recognized as H. mercatorius. Cryptic variation is further uncovered in
   all species in their native range, with H. platycephalus and H. mabouia
   harbouring several highly divergent lineages, but further taxonomic
   assignments should await detailed assessments of distribution and
   molecular variation.

AB [1] The present study investigates the interaction between a
   self-propagating cyclonic vortex with two right vertical cylinders and
   determines the conditions for a vortex to bifurcate into two or more
   vortices. As in previous studies, after the cyclonic vortex came in
   contact with a cylinder, fluid peeled off the outer edge of the vortex
   and a so-called "streamer'' went around the cylinder in a
   counterclockwise direction. Under the right conditions, this fluid
   formed a new cyclonic vortex in the wake of the cylinder, causing
   bifurcation of the original vortex into two vortices. In some cases, two
   streamers formed and went around the two cylinders, each forming a new
   cyclonic vortex. During the experiments, three parameters were varied:
   G, the separation between the cylinders; d, the diameter of the incident
   vortex; and y, the distance of the center of the vortex from an axis
   passing through the center of the gap between the cylinders. The number
   of vortices generated by the interaction depends on the ratio G/d and on
   the geometry of the encounter, which is given by the ratio y/g, where g
   = G/2. An unexpected and revealing result was the formation of a dipole
   vortex downstream of the two islands for values of - 2 < y/g < 0, 0.25
   <= G/d <= 0.4, and Re-G > 200, where Re-G = U(G)G/nu is the Reynolds
   number and U-G is the maximum velocity of the vortex fluid in the gap. A
   possible mechanism is that the flow within the vortex was funneled
   between the two islands, and provided it had a sufficiently high
   velocity, a dipole formed, much like water ejected from a circular
   nozzle generates a dipole ring. The formation of a vortex of opposite
   sign to the incident vortex (i.e., anticyclonic) is in agreement with
   recent observations of North Brazil Current (NBC) rings interacting with
   the islands of Saint Vincent and Barbados in the eastern Caribbean. The
   passage between the islands of Saint Vincent and Barbados has values of
   G/d of approximately 0.5; hence the laboratory result suggests that both
   cyclonic and anticyclonic vortices could form downstream of them.

AB Communities with large Caribbean immigrant populations in Boston, Mass,
   have alarmingly high rates of both infant mortality and low-birth-weight
   infants. Although the federally funded Special Supplemental Food Program
   for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) has been shown to increase infant
   birth weight and reduce fetal mortality, observations made in this study
   show that pregnant Caribbean immigrants who enrolled in WIC did not
   receive comprehensive, culturally appropriate nutrition counseling.
   Public health nutritionists and other health care providers used the
   Basic Four food group model as the basis for their dietary
   recommendations. The Basic Four model, however, is culturally biased and
   does not accommodate the food habits of the Caribbean immigrant.
   Furthermore, it does not adequately address the needs of pregnant women
   who are either lactose malabsorbers or vegetarians. Using ethnographic
   and nutrition science research methods, two culturally appropriate food
   guides were developed to accommodate the food practices of pregnant
   women from Haiti and the English-speaking Caribbean. The guides group
   foods into three categories: growth, protection, and energy. The guides
   not only include cultural foods but allow for the Recommended Dietary
   Allowance (RDA) for calcium to be met by nondairy sources and the RDA
   for protein to be met by vegetable sources. This study suggests that the
   Basic Four system is an inadequate model for Caribbean immigrants and
   that it is possible and necessary to construct culturally appropriate
   food guides that meet the US RDAs.

AB A collection of porcellanid crabs from Guadeloupe Island, Caribbean Sea
   Lesser Antilles, is reported. The specimens were obtained during the
   KARUBENTHOS Expedition (V.2012), a 1-month intensive survey of selected
   habitats in shallow water to moderate depth (intertidal to 160 m). A
   total of 20 species were found, 15 of which represent new records for
   Guadeloupe Island. Almost all species were photographed in color shortly
   after capture. For each species, a diagnosis, notes on habitat,
   geographical distribution, and taxonomic remarks, are given. The 20
   species of porcellanid crabs found in Guadeloupe Island represent 54% of
   a total of 37 species known from the entire Lesser Antilles (Anguilla to
   Trinidad) and the islands off Venezuela (Testigos to Aruba). The
   richness of the porcellanid fauna of Guadeloupe Island indicates a high
   biodiversity potential in other decapod crustaceans or invertebrates in
   general, living in marine habitats of this Island.

AB In Florida, the reef-building polychaete Phragmatopoma lapidosa is
   important in enhancing local biodiversity via the shelter it provides
   for various fish and invertebrate species. While the range of P.
   lapidosa extends south to Brazil, it is rare to find well-established
   populations in the Caribbean islands. In this study, we examined an
   intertidal worm reef recently discovered in St. Croix, U.S. Virgin
   Islands. The worm species was positively identified as P. lapidosa (also
   known as P. caudata). Analyses of measured worm lengths and mound
   photographs revealed multiple size cohorts that likely included recent
   recruits, and mature adults. An examination of the organisms living
   within small worm clumps collected from the reef, revealed a number of
   invertebrates including various mollusks, crabs, shrimp and echinoids.
   Combined, these data suggest that continuous recruitment is likely to
   maintain this worm reef which is similar to Florida worm reefs, and
   likely to enhance local biodiversity in St. Croix.

AB Certain biodiversity patterns on coral reefs are generally consistent
   but we still lack fundamental insight into how assemblages vary across
   spatially heterogeneous reef systems. We compared fish, coral, and
   sponge assemblages across a symmetrical physiographical gradient
   (windward forereef, lagoon patch reef, leeward forereef) of the Glover's
   Reef atoll, Belize. Species richness of fishes and corals was highest in
   the deep habitat (15m) on the windward forereef. Sponges were diverse
   and abundant on both deep windward and leeward forereefs but not on the
   exposed shallow (5m) windward forereef. Fish and benthic assemblages
   were relatively distinct in each reef zone, with the lagoon patch reef
   communities consisting of a combination of leeward and windward species.
   Nevertheless, there were no clear patterns in community similarity
   matrices of fish and benthic assemblages, suggesting that overall coral
   and sponge assemblages had weak or no direct association with patterns
   in fish assemblages. A closer examination of fish trophic groups
   indicated that planktivores and predators were predictably associated
   with depth, whereas herbivores were associated with shallow protected
   reefs. None was specifically associated with spatial location along the
   atoll gradient. These patterns of diversity distribution are important
   for identifying spatial conservation priorities. A Marine Protected Area
   (MPA) at Glover's Reef encompasses substantial windward forereef and
   patch reef habitats. A much lesser extent of protection is afforded the
   leeward forereef that supports faunal assemblages that are unique and
   productive, if not as diverse as the windward forereef. Isolated coral
   atolls can serve as ideal systems to study spatial heterogeneity and
   biodiversity patterns, but more experimental studies are needed to
   reveal the mechanistic processes underlying these patterns.

AB We assessed the effect of geographical distance on insect species
   turnover in a situation where other major environmental factors,
   including host plant species, altitude, and climate, were constant. We
   sampled ambrosia beetles (Coleoptera, Curculionidae: Scolytinae and
   Platypodinae) from four tree species: Artocarpus altilis, Ficus nodosa,
   Leea indica and Nauclea orientalis, at three sites forming a 1000 km
   transect in lowland rainforests of northern Papua New Guinea. A
   standardized volume of wood from trunk, branches and twigs was sampled
   for ambrosia beetles from three individuals of the four tree species at
   each site. Each tree was killed standing and left exposed to beetle
   colonization for 20 days prior to sampling. We obtained 12 751
   individuals from 84 morphospecies of ambrosia beetles. We surveyed most
   of the local species richness at each site, predicted by Chao 2 species
   richness estimates. The similarity of ambrosia beetle communities,
   estimated by Chao-Sorensen index, was not correlated with their
   geographical distance. Likelihood analysis and Q-mode analysis using
   Monte Carlo-generated null distribution of beetles among sites supported
   the hypothesis that the assemblages of ambrosia beetles at different
   sites are drawn from the same species pool, regardless of their
   geographical distance. Tree part (trunk, branch, or twig) was more
   important predictor of the composition of ambrosia beetle communities
   than was the host species or geographical location. All three variables,
   however, explained only a small portion of variability in ambrosia
   assemblages. The distribution of ambrosia beetles among tree parts, tree
   species and study sites was mostly random, suggesting limited importance
   of host specificity or dispersal limitation.

AB The reduced biodiversity of Caribbean coral reefs has been attributed to
   disturbances of various types. Many of the once abundant coral species
   have disappeared from Jamaican coral reefs with algae taking their place
   resulting in a less attractive reef habit with fewer fish which has
   affected the Jamaican economy. The mortality of Acropora species has
   been a particularly important driving force in shaping the transition.
   The abundance of Acropora spat settling in the Caribbean are lower than
   other coral families and much lower than on South Pacific reefs. A
   natural recovery through sexual reproduction is unlikely in the next
   decade. The long-term survival of remnant A. cervicornis populations is
   threatened unless successful sexual reproduction is restored. This study
   seeks to assess methods of restoring A. cervicornis populations by
   creating pockets of greater reef health around surviving populations.
   Experimental transplants using several techniques are underway to
   develop a suitable technology for restoring A. cervicornis populations
   in Jamaica. In one technique the mean survivorship ranged from 4% - 78%
   after 55 weeks. Mortality associated with damselfish (Stegastes) and
   fireworms (Hennodice carunculata) were observed. By increasing coral
   habitat biomass and complexity we can increase the abundance of fish
   populations which will result in greater fish catches for subsistence
   fishers. As well, more coral and fish biodiversity improves the
   attractiveness of the reef community for divers and snorkelers making
   Jamaica a more appealing destination for tourists.

AB The Queen conch Strombus gigas, a large marine gastropod, is found in
   the territorial waters of 36 countries and territories in the Caribbean
   region. Over the past decades, intensive fishing has led to population
   declines resulting in the total or temporary closure of the fishery in a
   number of locations. Since November 1992, the species has been included
   in Appendix II of CITES. In 2002, concerns about levels of illegal trade
   led to a 'Review of Significant Trade' in queen conch by TRAFFIC on
   behalf of the CITES. For this review, data on commercial fisheries
   landings, CITES trade data, stock status, and management measures were
   compiled with the assistance of CITES and fisheries authorities, and
   regional experts. Available information suggests that the majority of
   conch populations have continued to decline since the species was listed
   in CITES. Between 1993 and 1998, the total annual landings of
   (unprocessed) conch meat ranged between 6,534 and 7,370 metric tons (t);
   in 2001 the landings had fallen to 3,169 t. Most landings were reported
   from the Dominican Republic, Jamaica, and Honduras. From 1992 to 2001,
   total exports were 21,649 t of (processed) meat. The largest exporters
   are Jamaica and Honduras, followed by the Turks and Caicos Islands, the
   Bahamas, the Dominican Republic, Colombia, and Belize. Seventy-eight per
   cent of all queen conch meat in international trade is imported by the
   US. In response to the declines, the majority of range States have
   imposed measures for the management and conservation of the conch
   fisheries. However in several countries, such efforts are undermined by
   insufficient stock, landings, and trade data. There is also evidence of
   increased levels of illegal harvesting and trade including that by
   vessels in waters under other State's jurisdictions. Localized
   exploitation of deeper stocks and juveniles, the shift to remote
   harvesting areas, and low population densities suggest that some
   populations are depleted and local fishery collapses are possible. Of
   particular concern are the high exports reported from countries where
   only sparse information on stocks is available, where management is
   weak, and were available information suggest that significant portions
   of conch are fished in waters of neighboring countries. It is hoped that
   the CITES review process will assist range States in addressing these
   issues and support their efforts in ensuring that the harvest and trade
   in Queen conch is sustainable.

AB Recently, Pterois volitans, a Pacific species of lionfish, invaded the
   Atlantic Ocean, likely via the aquarium trade. We examined for internal
   and external parasites 188 individuals from 8 municipalities of Puerto
   Rico collected during 2009-2012, 91 individuals from Little Cayman,
   Cayman Islands, collected during the summers of 2010 and 2011, and 47
   individuals from Lee Stocking Island, Bahamas, collected during the
   summer of 2009. In total, 27 parasite taxa were found, including 3
   previously reported species from lionfish, the digenean Lecithochirium
   floridense, the leech Trachelobdella lubrica, and an Excorallana sp.
   isopod. We also report another 24 previously unreported parasite taxa
   from lionfish, including digeneans, monogeneans, cestodes, nematodes,
   isopods, a copepod, and an acanthocephalan. Among these parasites,
   several were previously unreported at their respective geographic
   origins: We report 5 new locality records from Puerto Rico, 9 from
   Cayman Islands, 5 from the Bahamas, 5 from the Caribbean, and 3 from the
   subtropical western Atlantic region. Three parasites are reported to
   associate with a fish host for the first time. The parasite faunas of P.
   volitans among our 3 study sites were quite different; most of the
   species infecting lionfish were generalists and/or species that infect
   carnivorous fishes. Although our study did not assess the impact of
   parasites on the fitness of invasive lionfish, it provides an important
   early step. Our results provide valuable comparative data for future
   studies at these and other sites throughout the lionfish's invaded
   range.

AB The most recent deglaciation resulted in a global sea-level rise of some
   120 m over ca 12 000 years. A moving boundary numerical model is
   developed to predict the response of rivers to this rise. The model was
   motivated by experiments at small scale, which have identified two modes
   describing the transgression of a river mouth: (i) autoretreat without
   abandonment of the river delta (no sediment starvation at the
   topset-foreset break); and (ii) sediment-starved autoretreat with
   abandonment of the delta. In the latter case, transgression is far more
   rapid, and its effects are felt much further upstream of the river
   mouth. A moving boundary numerical model that captures these features in
   experimental deltas is adapted to describe the response of the
   Fly-Strickland River system, Papua New Guinea. In the absence of better
   information, the model is applied to the case of sea-level rise without
   local climate change in New Guinea. The model suggests that: (i)
   sea-level rise has forced the river mouth to transgress over 700 km
   since the last glacial maximum; (ii) sediment-starved autoretreat has
   forced enough bed aggradation to block a tributary with a low sediment
   load and create the present-day Lake Murray; (iii) the resulting
   aggradation was sufficient to move the gravel-sand transition on the
   Strickland River upstream; (iv) the present-day Fly Estuary may be, in
   part, a relict river valley drowned by sea-level rise and partially
   filled by tidal effects; and (v) the Fly River is presently reforming
   its bankfull geometry and prograding into the Fly Estuary. A parametric
   study with the model indicates that sediment concentration during floods
   plays a key role in determining whether or not, and to what extent,
   transgression is expressed in terms of sediment-starved autoretreat. A
   sufficiently high sediment concentration can prevent sediment-starved
   autoretreat during the entire sea-level cycle. This observation may
   explain why some present-day river mouths are expressed in terms of
   deltas protruding into the sea, and others are wholly contained within
   embayments or estuaries in which water has invaded landward.

   wirzi, Periophthalmodon freycineti, Periophthalmus darwini,
   Periophthalmus novaeguineaensis, Periophthalmus takita, Periophthalmus
   weberi, Scartelaos histophorus and Zappa confluentus. An exploratory
   multivariate analysis of their habitat conditions discriminated five
   guilds, differentially distributed in habitats with different quantities
   of environmental water and three guilds corresponding to different
   levels of salinity. A partial correspondence between phylogenetic and
   ecological categories suggested the presence of parallel adaptive
   radiations within different genera. In particular, the species found in
   the most terrestrial habitats (P. weberi) was also found in the widest
   range of conditions, suggesting that colonization of extreme
   semi-terrestrial and freshwater habitats by this species was facilitated
   by eurytypy. It is proposed that these findings provide insight into
   convergent adaptations for the vertebrate eco-evolutionary transition
   from sea to land.

AB In describing a new species of pedunculate barnacle that occurs in large
   numbers in sulphidic seep conditions on a volcanic seamount off Lihir
   Island, Papua New Guinea, it has been necessary to revise the
   Neolepadinae and erect two new genera. Capitulum and peduncle characters
   distinguish the new genera from the species of Neolepas that occur at
   hydrothermal vents along the East Pacific Rise. The new genus and
   species from Lihir Island also differs from Neolepas osheai described
   from the Kermadec Ridge, which, together with an undescribed species
   discovered on the Pacific-Antarctic Ridge, belongs to another new genus.
   The species discussed are all adapted to feed on fine particles,
   including bacteria.

AB Concentrations of persistent organochlorine residues were determined in
   fish collected from several locations in eastern and southern Asia and
   Oceania to identify the accumulation features of such residues in
   tropical aquatic organisms and to elucidate their distribution in
   tropical developing countries. DDT and its derivatives (DDTs) were the
   predominantly identified compounds in most locations. In general, the
   concentrations of organochlorines in tropical fish were lower than those
   in fish of the temperate regions. Residue levels in fish showed little
   spatial variability, as reported for tropical sediments. This is
   different from the patterns observed for air and water in which higher
   concentrations occur in tropical latitudes compared to mid-latitudes.
   Compilation of limited available data on the organochlorine residue
   levels in fish in tropical Asian countries seemed to indicate little
   temporal variability due to the low levels of accumulation in aquatic
   organisms, despite the continuous use of these compounds. A short
   residence time of semivolatile organochlorines in the tropical aquatic
   environment results in lower levels of accumulation of residues in fish.
   Examination of walleye pollock (Theragra chalcogramma) collected from
   the Bering Sea indicated that organochlorine residue levels are
   declining in temperate water bodies near the Arctic Ocean in recent
   years.

AB Upwelling of the (comparatively) iron-rich waters of the Equatorial
   Undercurrent (EUC) may control new production in the central and eastern
   equatorial Pacific. In an attempt to determine the source of this iron,
   we measured total dissolvable iron (Fe(TD)) concentrations in the
   Bismarck Sea on three cruises of K T Franklin as part of the Australian
   Joint Global Ocean Flux Study (JGOFS) program in 1993 and the Tropical
   River Ocean Processes In Coastal Settings (TROPICS) program in 1997 and
   2000. Data in the Bismarck Sea were collected during the SE tradewind
   season at a time of a strong El Nino and severe drought in Papua New
   Guinea (PNG) (FR07/97), and during the NW monsoon season (FR01/00). Our
   results show that the New Guinea Coastal Undercurrent (NGCU) and the EUC
   in the western equatorial Pacific are enriched in iron that does not
   seem to be supplied directly from the Sepik River nor from known deep
   hydrothermal sources in the Bismarck Sea. The concentration of Fe(TD) in
   the NGCU does increase as it flows along the north coast of PNG and we
   propose that the Fe is mainly supplied by sediments deposited on the
   narrow continental shelf by the Sepik and other rivers. There is
   indirect evidence for an additional supply of iron via the New Ireland
   Coastal Undercurrent. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights

   teno sus virus (TTSuV) in kidneys of slaughter-age, apparently healthy
   pigs on St. Kitts island, Lesser Antilles. TTSuV1 and TTSuVk2a were
   detected in 23 (37.7%) and 13 (21.3%) pigs, respectively, including
   mixed infection in five animals. By nucleotide sequence identities and
   phylogenetic analysis, significant genetic diversity was observed among
   both TTSuV1 and TTSuVk2a on St. Kitts, with TTSuVk2a showing higher
   genetic diversity than TTSuV1. Fourteen (45.2%) and 10 (32.2%) of the
   TTSuV infected pigs tested positive for porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV2)
   and porcine parvovirus (PPV), respectively, revealing high rates of
   co-infection of TTSuV with PCV2 and PPV. This is the first report on
   detection and genetic diversity of TTSuV from the Lesser Antilles. Also,
   PCV2 and PPV were detected for the first time in the Lesser Antilles.
   Considering the impact of pig farming on the regional livestock economy,
   the increasing demand for local pork and lack of information on emerging
   and re-emerging porcine viruses in the Lesser Antilles, the present
   findings have important implications on swine health.

AB Characterizing species occurrence, abundance, and distribution is
   critical to the management of natural resources and the conservation of
   biodiversity. In the Western Caribbean, little information exists on the
   occurrence of aquatic mammals along the Mesoamerican Barrier Reef System
   and adjacent aquatic ecosystems. Herein, we present the first
   comprehensive review of aquatic mammals encountered in the marine and
   freshwater habitats of Belize. To determine which aquatic mammal species
   occur in Belizean waters, we conducted an extensive review of published
   and unpublished reports of aquatic mammals. We located 163 unique
   reports from museum and animal collections, journal articles, theses,
   news reports, conference proceedings, institutional reports, and
   verified accounts from personal observations. Our review confirms the
   presence of 17 aquatic mammal species in Belize: 15 cetaceans (Megaptera
   novaeangliae, Balaenoptera physalus, Ziphius cavirostris, Physeter
   macrocephalus, Kogia breviceps, Orcinus orca, Pseudorca crassidens,
   Globicephala macrorhynchus, Peponocephala electra, Stenella attenuata,
   S. clymene, S. frontalis, S. longirostris, Steno bredanensis, and
   Tursiops truncatus), one sirenian (Trichechus manatus manatus), and one
   carnivore (Lontra longicaudis annectens). Our findings provide the most
   up-to-date list of aquatic mammal presence in Belize. Given the limited
   data points obtained for most identified species, we recommend that
   systematic studies be conducted to investigate the status of the variety
   of aquatic mammals in the region to effectively monitor populations and
   devise strategies to mitigate the negative impacts of anthropogenic
   activity and climate change-related ecosystem shifts.

AB Tropical dry forests in south Florida occur as fragments in the Florida
   Keys, Miami-Dade county and the Florida Everglades. Native woody plants
   were examined in 23 plots (500 m(2)) in mature stands of tropical dry
   forest and 48 reserves in south Florida. In total, 64 native woody
   species were recorded whose primary habitat is dry forest. Tropical dry
   forests in south Florida contain low diversity and endemism, but the
   floristic composition and forest structure are similar to those of dry
   forests in the Bahamas and coastal Cuba. Dry forests in south Florida
   and the Caribbean have significantly different natural history
   characteristics (flower size, dispersal types and canopy phenology)
   compared with most neotropical dry forests on the mainland. There are 23
   species listed as endangered and nine species listed as threatened.
   However, the conservation status of remaining fragments in south Florida
   can be viewed as excellent based on the number of reserves and reserve
   management.

AB Although reef coral skeletal carbon isotopes (delta C-13) are routinely
   measured, interpretation remains controversial. Here we show results of
   a consistent inverse relationship between coral delta C-13 and skeletal
   extension rate over the last several centuries in Porites corals at
   Fiji, Tonga, Rarotonga and American Samoa in the southwest Pacific.
   Beginning in the 1950s, this relationship breaks down as the atmospheric
   C-13 Suess effect shifts skeletal delta C-13 > 1.0% lower. We also
   compiled coral delta C-13 from a global array of sites and find that
   mean coral delta C-13 decreases by -1.4% for every 5m increase in water
   depth (R = 0.68, p < 0.01). This highlights the fundamental sensitivity
   of coral delta C-13 to endosymbiotic photosynthesis. Collectively, these
   results suggest that photosynthetic rate largely determines mean coral
   delta C-13 while changes in extension rate and metabolic effects over
   time modulate skeletal delta C-13 around this mean value. The newly
   quantified coral delta C-13-water depth relationship may be an effective
   tool for improving the precision of paleo-sea level reconstruction using
   corals.

AB Permit, Trachinotus falcatus are economically and ecologically important
   throughout their range of the Caribbean, subtropical and tropical
   western Atlantic, and Gulf of Mexico. Despite their economic importance,
   little is known about the biology and ecology of permit, and most
   existing information is from Florida. While sufficient information is
   available to paint a general picture of permit life history, details are
   lacking for most life stages. For the juvenile life stage, nursery
   habitats and size and age at settlement have not yet been defined.
   Although six distinct habitat types (medium energy and low energy
   windward beaches, leeward beaches, and windward, leeward, and lagoon
   interior mangrove shorelines) were sampled to determine spatial patterns
   of habitat use by early juvenile permit at Turneffe Atoll, Belize,
   Central America, and the Florida Keys, USA, 99% of juvenile permit were
   found along medium energy windward beaches, indicating their role as
   nursery habitat for this species. A sub-sample of juvenile permit from
   Florida was examined to estimate spawning date and age at settlement
   from otoliths. Size-frequency distributions and otolith age analysis
   indicate that larval duration is approximately 15 - 20 days, and
   settlement occurs year-round. Since permit in Florida spawn March
   through July, from March through September in Cuba, and from February
   through October in Belize, year-round settlement indicates population
   connectivity via larval transport. These results lay the foundation for
   future research on larval supply, population connectivity, and juvenile
   ecology, and will aid in the ongoing formulation of a conservation plan
   toward a sustainable fishery for permit.

AB In our opinion roughly 13 Sv or 45% of the transport of the Florida
   Current is of South Atlantic origin, as compensation for the
   cross-equatorial flow of North Atlantic Deep Water.  Of the 8.9 Sv
   moving through the Straits of Florida with temperatures above
   24-degrees-C in the upper 100 m of the water column, 7.1 Sv is composed
   of comparatively fresh water coming through the southern Caribbean
   passages from the tropical South Atlantic.  Saltier surface water, 1.8
   Sv, enters from the North Atlantic through Windward Passage, as does
   most of the 18-degrees Water in the Florida Current.  A South Atlantic
   contribution for the uppermost layer is clear-cut because the surface
   water in the open Atlantic north of the Caribbean is comparatively cold
   and salty and intrudes south as Subtropical Underwater or
   Salinity-Maximum Water below a comparatively warm and fresh layer 50-100
   m thick, which could hardly be transported from the North Atlantic.  Of
   the 13.8 Sv transported through the Caribbean in the 12-24-degrees-C
   temperature range, 13.0 Sv is of North Atlantic origin, with about 0.8
   Sv of comparatively fresh South Atlantic water on the western side of
   the Florida Straits having entered the Caribbean on the southern side of
   St. Vincent and St. Lucia Passages.  Of the 6 Sv transported by the
   Florida Current in the 7-12-degrees-C temperature range, 5 Sv appears to
   originate in the South Atlantic.  Our estimate of the 13 Sv of South
   Atlantic and 16 Sv of North Atlantic origin for the total transport of
   29 Sv for the Florida Current, along with partitioning in the
   aforementioned temperature ranges, is approximately consistent with open
   ocean sections along 24-degrees-N and with several previous
   investigations.
   We have formed a new estimate of the transport into five key Caribbean
   passages, yielding 28.8 Sv for the temperature range appropriate to the
   Straits of Florida off Miami, in close agreement with independent
   transport measurements for the Florida Current.  The five passages and
   their contributions are:  Grenada (7.7 Sv), St. Vincent (7.9 Sv), St.
   Lucia (3.8 Sv), Dominica (2.6 Sv), and Windward (6.8 Sv).  Breakdowns of
   these passage transport estimates into broad classes by temperature
   range agree to within about 2 Sv in comparison with similar quantities
   for the Florida Current.  Anegada Passage may transport 0.5 Sv of water
   that exists through the upper 200 m or so of the Florida Current, and
   the mid-depth (5-12-degrees-C) flow in this passage and in the general
   vicinity of the Caribbean deserves further examination.

AB The prey choice model, previously applied among shellfish gatherers in
   Kiribati, Micronesia, has shown that they are foraging in a manner that
   matches the predictions of optimal foraging theory by maximizing their
   net energy return rates. Similar conclusions can be drawn subsequent to
   testing the patch choice model, including patch switching; patch
   sampling; and the analysis of risk. In light of these results, it is
   argued that natural selection probably never encouraged the persistence
   of conservation because individuals have nearly always benefited from
   short-term goals to ensure greater fitness. However, the possibility
   remains that as a result of changed circumstances brought about by
   increasing human population, more efficient extractive technologies, and
   expanding market opportunities, genuine, as opposed to epiphenomenal
   conservation, may become established in heavily impacted environments.

AB The good governance of institutions and regimes requires accountability
   suited to the particular context of each institution and regime. The
   paper examines the nature of accountability in climate change governance
   using the Caribbean region as a case study. In doing so, the paper makes
   two original contributions. First, using insights from the environmental
   governance literature, it presents a conceptual framework that
   categorises the types (levels, relationships and mechanisms) of
   accountability in governance that can be used to test accountability.
   The accountability framework comprises two levels (internal/external
   accountability); four relationships (normative, relational, decision and
   behavioural); and four mechanisms or processes through which
   accountability can be exercised (certification, monitoring,
   participation by stakeholders in the overseeing of projects and
   self-reporting). Second, through an analysis of survey and interview
   responses from Caribbean climate change experts, it reports on the
   nature of accountability in climate change governance in the context of
   Caribbean Small Island Developing States. To do this, first it
   identifies the actors involved in Caribbean climate governance at the
   regional and national scales. Then, using the framework, it examines
   which levels, relationships and processes exist within and between
   climate governance regional institutions, international partners,
   government agencies, non-governmental organisations and the private
   sector for climate change adaptation and mitigation efforts. The paper
   draws two main conclusions: first, generally actors valued
   accountability as a good governance norm. Secondly, limited resources
   and the perception that using the accountability mechanisms will retard
   policy implementation led to low levels of accountability in practice.
   Finally, the study examined how accountability can be enhanced in the
   climate change sector by ensuring that each of the elements of the
   framework is operationalised for both state and non-state climate change
   projects.

AB Unusual inclusion bodies occur within the epithelial cells of the
   digestive gland of queen conch, Lobatus gigas, and have previously been
   described as apicomplexan parasites. The aim of this study was to
   investigate the parasitic features of these inclusion bodies in queen
   conch. L. gigas from St. Kitts (Caribbean Sea) consistently (100% of n =
   61) showed large numbers of ovoid to tri-bulbous dark brown inclusion
   bodies (15 x 30 mu m) within vacuolar cells. Histochemical stains
   demonstrated iron, melanin, and glycoprotein and/or mucopolysaccharide
   within the inclusion bodies. Microscopic features indicative of a host
   response to injury were lacking in every case, as were consistent
   morphological forms to indicate distinct parasitic stages. Transmission
   electron microscopy failed to reveal cellular organelles of parasitic
   organisms and DNA extractions of purified inclusion bodies did not yield
   sufficient concentrations for successful PCR amplification. Scanning
   electron microscopy with energy dispersive X-ray analysis revealed a
   number of elements, particularly iron, within the inclusion bodies. We
   conclude that the inclusion bodies are not an infectious agent, and
   hypothesize that they represent a storage form for iron, and potentially
   other elements, within a protein matrix. Similar structures have been
   described in the digestive glands of other invertebrates, including
   prosobranchs.

AB Residents of the island nation of Tuvalu will be among the first of the
   1.7 million Pacific Islanders to be displaced by the effects of climate
   change (including rising sea levels, changing distributions of
   agriculture, and unpredictable weather patterns). Already 3,500
   Tuvaluans live in New Zealand (approximately 25 percent of the world's
   Tuvaluan population), some of whom moved due to climate change.
   Immigrating to New Zealand presents several challenges for Tuvaluans,
   including limited job opportunities, health care disparities, and
   dietary changes. Nevertheless, Tuvaluans in New Zealand continue their
   culture as they redefine their identity in a new country. Given the
   growing effects of climate change, physicians around the world will soon
   care for a new generation of immigrants and will play an important role
   in advocating for health equity and self-determination among
   climate-sensitive populations. This article uses personal stories and
   photographs of Tuvaluans and photographs of Tuvalu and New Zealand to
   present Tuvaluans' struggles and ethical issues pertaining to health
   that arise in relocating Tuvaluans.

AB The water buffalo is an important domestic animal worldwide, and the
   local Buffalypso variety was developed in Trinidad to have improved beef
   qualities. Brucellosis was diagnosed in Trinidad and Tobago during 1998
   in both cattle and domestic water buffalo (Bubalus bubalis) populations.
   Brucellosis in the latter species is caused by infection with Brucella
   abortus, similar to bovine brucellosis. Control of brucellosis is of
   paramount importance to preservation of the genetic diversity of these
   animals in Trinidad, and this has been complicated by differences in the
   epidemiology of water buffalo and bovine brucellosis. Some diagnostic
   tests do not have comparable accuracy between the two species, and the
   RB51 vaccine does not adequately protect against infection in water
   buffalo. The water buffalo in Trinidad may also be more resistant to
   infection than cattle. Development of effective vaccination protocols is
   key to brucellosis control in Buffalypso in Trinidad, and prohibitions
   on import of virulent B. abortus strains for vaccine efficacy studies
   has impeded progress in this area. These Trinidadian strains are of
   variable virulence; some might be effective for challenge in vaccine
   efficacy studies, while other, of lower virulence, may be vaccine
   candidates for use in water buffalo.

AB Coral-associated invertebrates dominate the biodiversity of coral reefs.
   Some of the associations involving symbiotic invertebrates remain
   unknown or little studied. This holds true even for relatively
   well-studied coral reefs, like those in the Caribbean Sea. Coral gall
   crabs (Cryptochiridae), obligate symbionts of stony corals, form a
   much-overlooked component of coral reef communities. Most recent studies
   on the Atlantic members of Cryptochiridae have been conducted off Brazil
   and little recent data have become available from the Caribbean region.
   During fieldwork off Curacao (southern Caribbean Sea), eight new host
   coral species, belonging to four coral families, were recorded for three
   cryptochirid species. Kroppcarcinus siderastreicola Badaro, Neves,
   Castro and Johnsson, 2012, previously only known from Brazil, and
   Opecarcinus hypostegus (Shaw and Hopkins, 1977) are new additions to the
   fauna of Curacao. Besides the new hosts and geographic range extensions,
   a free-living male Troglocarcinus corallicola Verrill, 1908 was observed
   visiting a female of the same species lodged in her gall in an Orbicella
   annularis (Ellis and Solander, 1786) colony. This is the first
   photodocumented record of the "visiting" mating system in
   Cryptochiridae.

AB Temperate-zone species have responded to warming temperatures by
   shifting their distributions poleward and upslope. Thermal tolerance
   data suggests that tropical species may respond to warming temperatures
   even more strongly than temperate-zone species, but this prediction has
   yet to be tested. We addressed this data gap by conducting resurveys to
   measure distributional responses to temperature increases in the
   elevational limits of the avifaunas of two geographically and faunally
   independent New Guinean mountains, Mt. Karimui and Karkar Island, 47 and
   44 y after they were originally surveyed. Although species richness is
   roughly five times greater on mainland Mt. Karimui than oceanic Karkar
   Island, distributional shifts at both sites were similar: upslope shifts
   averaged 113 m (Mt. Karimui) and 152 m (Karkar Island) for upper limits
   and 95 m (Mt. Karimui) and 123 m (Karkar Island) for lower limits. We
   incorporated these results into a metaanalysis to compare distributional
   responses of tropical species with those of temperate-zone species,
   finding that average upslope shifts in tropical montane species match
   local temperature increases significantly more closely than in
   temperate-zone montane species. That tropical species appear to be
   strong responders has global conservation implications and provides
   empirical support to hitherto untested models that predict widespread
   extinctions in upper-elevation tropical endemics with small ranges.

AB Seven benthic foraminiferal assemblages were identified in vibracores
   through Holocene lagoons of three Belize atoll lagoons (Glovers Reef,
   Lighthouse Reef, Turneffe Islands). These include (1) the low-diversity
   Cribroelphidium assemblage (2) the Cribroelphidium-Elphidium assemblage
   (3) the Quinqueloculina-Triloculina-Peneroplis assemblage (4) the
   high-diversity miliolid assemblage (5) the Archaias-miliolid assemblage
   (6) the low-diversity miliolid assemblage, and (7) the mixed assemblage.
   Altogether, 109 species and 56 genera were identified. The highest
   diversities are observed in the largest lagoon (Turneffe Islands),
   whereas one of the smaller lagoons (Glovers Reef) exhibits the lowest
   diversities during the Holocene. No significant changes in diversity
   over time occur, however, a slight trend to higher diversity may be
   observed through the Holocene, suggesting that the foraminiferal faunas
   in the atolls are in a diversification stage. Faunal diversity in atoll
   lagoons appears to be controlled largely by habitat size, habitat
   heterogeneity, and water circulation. Habitat age and water depth only
   play minor roles. Substrate texture, water depth, and turbidity
   influence the predominant modes of life of benthic foraminifera
   encountered in the lagoons (epifaunal versus infaunal versus
   symbiont-bearing). Time-averaging effects were not observed, even though
   lagoonal sedimentation rates fluctuate in individual cores and the three
   lagoons, and despite the fact that sediments are modified through
   bioturbation by callianassid shrimps. This finding underlines the
   potential of benthic foraminifera for paleoecological studies in the
   fossil record of reefs and carbonate platforms.

AB The microchiropteran bat family Emballonuridae is widely distributed in
   archipelagos of the southwestern Pacific, with especially strong
   representation of genera Emballonura and Mosia. DNA sequences from three
   segments of the mitochondrial genome were collected from four species of
   Emballonura and from M. nigrescens to investigate the relationship of
   genetic differentiation to archipelago biogeography. Specimens of each
   species formed monophyletic clades in maximum parsimony and Bayesian
   analyses. Mosia nigrescens was genetically distant to the other four
   species. The other four studied species formed a monophyletic clade
   composed of the pairs E. beccarii, E. serii and E. raffrayana, E.
   semicaudata. Clades within species were strongly concordant with
   geography, with only two counterexamples (E. semicaudata in Fiji and E.
   raffiayana in the Solomon Islands) to the general finding that each
   island's population of a species constitutes a monophyletic clade.
   Genetic results do not agree with current subspecific designations
   within M. nigrescens. Samples from Woodlark, Alcester, and Manus Islands
   are phylogenetically closer to Papuan mainland samples than to Solomon
   Islands and New Ireland samples supposedly belonging to the same
   subspecies. Results suggest that Emballonura can establish populations
   across wide water barriers but does so infrequently. The isolating
   effect of water barriers is exemplified by the substantial genetic
   distinctiveness of Solomon Islands and New Ireland populations of both
   E. raffrayana and M. nigrescens. Absence from New Britain of E.
   beccarii,, E. raffrayana, and E. serii (all known from New Ireland) may
   also reflect effects of water barriers if not due to collecting
   artifacts.

AB The myrtaceous tree Melaleuca quinquenervia (Cav.) Blake occurs
   naturally along Australia's eastern coast and has been internationally
   disseminated for ornamental and agroforestry purposes. We describe the
   naturalization of M. quinquenervia in the Bahamas and compare stand
   characteristics to other populations in the exotic tree's native and
   adventive ranges. Naturalized M. quinquenervia stands were assessed at
   single locations on Grand Bahama, New Providence and Andros Island. We
   conclude that M. quinquenervia is at an incipient stage of invasion at
   these locations, based on the small spatial distribution of stands and
   the relatively smaller size class distributions at each site. Densities
   of the M. quinquenervia stands varied dramatically among sites, ranging
   from 11,800 to 105,800 trees per ha and fell within the range of stands
   observed in other adventive ranges, including Florida (USA) where the
   tree is among the most insidious invaders of natural areas. M.
   quinquenervia trees in the Bahamas have greater biomass dedicated to
   reproductive structures than other adventive ranges. The number of
   capsular fruit produced per cm of infructescence is similar among
   adventive ranges but markedly greater in comparison to its native range
   of Australia. As a result of invasion, native plant diversity was
   negatively correlated with increases in M. quinquenervia densities.
   Consistent with many plant invasions, the most probable seed sources for
   these naturalized populations are nearby ornamental plantings. We
   predict that timely implementation of appropriate control tactics at
   this early stage of invasion with adequate follow-up efforts and
   continued vigilance will greatly enhance the probability of averting a
   large scale M. quinquenervia invasion in the Bahamas.

AB Easterly waves (EWs) are prominent features of the intertropical
   convergence zone (ITCZ), found in both the Atlantic and Pacific during
   the Northern Hemisphere summer and fall, where they commonly serve as
   precursors to hurricanes over both basins. A large proportion of
   Atlantic EWs are known to form over Africa, but the origin of EWs over
   the Caribbean and east Pacific in particular has not been established in
   detail. In this study reanalyses are used to examine the coherence of
   the large-scale wave signatures and to obtain track statistics and
   energy conversion terms for EWs across this region. Regression analysis
   demonstrates that some EW kinematic structures readily propagate between
   the Atlantic and east Pacific, with the highest correlations observed
   across Costa Rica and Panama. Track statistics are consistent with this
   analysis and suggest that some individual waves are maintained as they
   pass from the Atlantic into the east Pacific, whereas others are
   generated locally in the Caribbean and east Pacific. Vortex anomalies
   associated with the waves are observed on the leeward side of the Sierra
   Madre, propagating northwestward along the coast, consistent with
   previous modeling studies of the interactions between zonal flow and EWs
   with model topography similar to the Sierra Madre. An energetics
   analysis additionally indicates that the Caribbean low-level jet and its
   extension into the east Pacific-known as the Papagayo jet-are a source
   of energy for EWs in the region. Two case studies support these
   statistics, as well as demonstrate the modulation of EW track and storm
   development location by the MJO.

AB A comparatively small and many ribbed Americardia living from Bermuda,
   off Florida to Caribbean Panama and Brazil is described and named after
   J.R.H. (Jack) Lightbourn. The new species has more anterior ribs and
   reaches a significantly smaller size than the two other Recent western
   Atlantic species. It also lives in deeper water, particularly in the
   northern part of its distribution. It is well represented in Bermuda and
   Brazil but has been confounded with the much larger, lower ribbed and
   shallow water Americardia media, best known from the West Indies. A
   comparison of the Pliocene Americardia columba (Heilprin, 1886) with
   Recent material revealed gross similarities, yet its marked distinct rib
   sculpture did not allow consideration of the latter material
   conspecific. Thus Americardia columbella, living from North Carolina to
   Yucatan, Mexico, is also described as new herein. These two new species'
   are compared with the type species, A. media, living from Florida to
   Ascension, and its congener A. speciosa, living exclusively at St.
   Helena. Instead of one, in Florida there are three and in Brazil two,
   extant Americardia. There is only one species living in the waters of
   Bermuda, North Carolina, Ascension, and St. Helena, but each of these
   populations represents a distinct Americardia species. Based on the most
   recent studies, the application of Americardia is genetically,
   biogeographically, and morphologically supported for this Atlantic and
   Eastern Pacific species complex. Consequently, Ctenocardia is restricted
   to the superficially similar but spiny Indo-Pacific species-group.
   According to Linnaeus, 1758 and 1767, his "O[ceano] Indico" type of
   Cardium medium should be at Uppsala only However, no type material or
   trace thereof could be found there. In reality the true identity of the
   Linnaean species is simply unknown and conspecificity with the
   Indo-Pacific Ctenocardia fornicata could not be excluded. To stabilize
   one of the "best known" Caribbean cardiids a neotype from material in
   the Linnean Society, London is selected, and McLean's supposed type
   locality, Cuba, Havana is herein confirmed.
   The Natural History Museum, London [NHMUK] type material of Cardium
   speciosum is comprised of four specimens, which, however, represent two
   species. Only one matches the original description and is confirmed as
   the holotype. The other three specimens were added after 1890.

AB Long-term and short-term (seasonal) migrations from Caribbean countries
   have been strategies for enhancing the livelihoods and assets of
   individuals and families for many decades. The greatest challenges to
   food security are felt by the populations below the poverty level, most
   of whom are rural dwellers. Taking two Caribbean countries - Jamaica,
   and St. Vincent and the Grenadines, this article assesses whether in
   rural, characteristically small-farming areas, the financial and social
   remittances resulting from migration are used to improve food security,
   through either supporting agricultural production or providing money to
   purchase food. The findings show the contrast between Jamaica and St.
   Vincent. Whereas migration generally benefits small-scale farming and
   domestic food production, increasing food accessibility in Jamaica,
   migration has been variously used by the rural poor in St. Vincent to
   replace farming. Food security in St. Vincent is heavily dependent on
   purchasing food and, in this regard, migrant remittances play an
   important role.

AB Focusing on human biogeography as a research endeavour may make sense to
   biogeographers, but in the academic world generally this particular
   scholarly niche has long been filled by other rival disciplines such as
   sociology, human ecology, geography, anthropology and archaeology. It
   may be true that having so many ways of looking at ourselves as a
   species is a good thing, but it can also be argued that this academic
   fragmentation of effort has often nurtured the commonplace view that we
   as a species are 'above' or 'not part of' what plain folks call the
   'natural world'. Here I review the historical and basic intellectual
   ingredients of what might be (but often isn't) called human
   biogeography. I offer a case study drawn from my research work on the
   Sepik coast of Papua New Guinea. This research illustrates how adopting
   an explicitly biogeographical approach to human diversity can lead to
   unexpected insights into the character and history of human settlement
   in this part of the world. One benefit of having a field with this
   explicit orientation might be that the conservation of biodiversity
   would make more sense to more people.

AB The impacts of drought in the Caribbean have not been as dramatic as in
   some other parts of world, but it is not exempt from the experiences of
   drought. As a result of the effects of a prolonged drought in 2009/2010,
   the agenda for the 21st Inter-Sessional Meeting of the Caribbean
   Community (CARICOM) paid particular attention to the issue of drought.
   This paper reviews the management framework for responding to drought
   disasters in five CARICOM countries. The paper also reports on some of
   the effects of the 2009/2010 drought with particular reference to
   Grenada and the Grenadines. During the drought in these islands there
   were numerous bush fires with devastating effects on agriculture, severe
   water shortages that impacted on the tourism industry and other social
   effects. It is evident that there was inadequate preparation for the
   event. Greater planning and investment are therefore required to reduce
   future impacts.

AB Satellite image-based mapping of tropical forests is vital to
   conservation planning. Standard methods for automated image
   classification, however, limit classification detail in complex tropical
   landscapes. In this study, we test an approach to Landsat image
   interpretation on four islands of the Lesser Antilles, including Grenada
   and St. Kitts, Nevis and St. Eustatius, testing a more detailed
   classification than earlier work in the latter three islands. Secondly,
   we estimate the extents of land cover and protected forest by formation
   for five islands and ask how land cover has changed over the second half
   of the 20(th) century. The image interpretation approach combines image
   mosaics and ancillary geographic data, classifying the resulting set of
   raster data with decision tree software. Cloud-free image mosaics for
   one or two seasons were created by applying regression tree
   normalization to scene dates that could fill cloudy areas in a base
   scene. Such mosaics are also known as cloud-filled, cloud-minimized or
   cloud-cleared imagery, mosaics, or composites. The approach accurately
   distinguished several classes that more standard methods would confuse;
   the seamless mosaics aided reference data collection; and the
   multiseason imagery allowed us to separate drought deciduous forests and
   woodlands from semi-deciduous ones. Cultivated land areas declined 60 to
   100 percent from about 1945 to 2000 on several islands. Meanwhile,
   forest cover has increased 50 to 950%. This trend will likely continue
   where sugar cane cultivation has dominated. Like the island of Puerto
   Rico, most higher-elevation forest formations are protected in formal or
   informal reserves. Also similarly, lowland forests, which are drier
   forest types on these islands, are not well represented in reserves.
   Former cultivated lands in lowland areas could provide lands for new
   reserves of drier forest types. The land-use history of these islands
   may provide insight for planners in countries currently considering
   lowland forest clearing for agriculture.

AB Tegus of the genera Tupinambis and Salvator are the largest Neotropical
   lizards and the most exploited clade of Neotropical reptiles. For three
   decades more than 34 million tegu skins were in trade, about 1.02
   million per year. The genus Tupinambis is distributed in South America
   east of the Andes, and currently contains four recognized species, three
   of which are found only in Brazil. However, the type species of the
   genus, T. teguixin, is known from Bolivia, Brazil, Colombia, Ecuador,
   French Guyana, Guyana, Peru, Suriname, Trinidad and Tobago, and
   Venezuela ( including the Isla de Margarita). Here we present molecular
   and morphological evidence that this species is genetically divergent
   across its range and identify four distinct clades some of which are
   sympatric. The occurrence of cryptic sympatric species undoubtedly
   exacerbated the nomenclatural problems of the past. We discuss the
   species supported by molecular and morphological evidence and increase
   the number of species in the genus Tupinambis to seven. The four members
   of the T. teguixin group continue to be confused with Salvator merianae,
   despite having a distinctly different morphology and reproductive mode.
   All members of the genus Tupinambis are CITES Appendix II. Yet, they
   continue to be heavily exploited, under studied, and confused in the
   minds of the public, conservationists, and scientists.

   Region (Cook Islands, Fiji, Tonga, Samoa, and Vanuatu). The samples were
   evaluated for comparative seasonal concentration of P, K, Ca, Mg, Fe,
   Mn, Cu, and Zn for grazing beef cattle, dairy cattle (dry and
   lactating), heifers, and goats. Macro- and micro-mineral concentrations
   in the browse species were affected by seasonal climatic conditions.
   Some of the browse species had higher concentrations of macro- and
   micro-minerals in either the dry or rainy seasons above the requirements
   of specific ruminant animals. The Fe concentration in most of the browse
   species was higher (P < 0.05) in the dry season compared to the rainy
   season. The Zn concentration was extremely low in the browse species.
   Some browse species met the macro- and micro-mineral requirements of
   grazing beef cattle, dairy cattle (dry and lactating), heifers, and
   goats, while others could not satisfy all the mineral requirements of
   specific ruminant animals. The seasonal variations in the concentration
   of the macro- and micro-minerals suggest that in formulating and (or)
   supplementing rations for ruminants, both the amount of minerals in
   legumes and biological availability of these minerals need to be
   considered in the South Pacific Region.

AB Aim Amphibians are a model group for studies of the biogeographical
   origins of salt-intolerant taxa on oceanic islands. We used the Gulf of
   Guinea islands to explore the biogeographical origins of island endemism
   of one species of frog, and used this to gain insights into potential
   colonization mechanisms.
   Location Sao Tome and Principe, two of the four major islands in the
   Gulf of Guinea, West Africa, are truly oceanic and have an exceptionally
   high biodiversity.
   Methods Mitochondrial DNA is used to test the endemic status of a frog
   from Sao Tome and compare it with congeneric taxa from tropical Africa.
   Existing data on surface currents, surface salinity, atmospheric
   circulation and bird migration in the Gulf of Guinea are summarized to
   address hypotheses concerning colonization mechanisms.
   Results The endemic status of Ptychadena newtoni (Bocage) is supported
   here by mitochondrial DNA sequences, and analysis of this and other
   molecular data indicates that an East African species close to
   Ptychadena mascareniensis (Dumeril and Bibron) is its nearest relative.
   We refute the possibility that this population was anthropogenically
   introduced, in favour of a natural dispersal mechanism.
   Main conclusions With six endemic frogs and one caecilian, the Gulf of
   Guinea islands harbour a diverse amphibian fauna. Five of these species
   appear to have their closest relatives in East Africa. Insufficient
   evidence exists for transportation by storms, birds or rafts alone.
   However, we propose a synergy of rafting, favourable surface currents
   and a reduction in salinity of surface waters. Catastrophic events, or
   wet periods in climatic history, could allow freshwater paths to open
   far enough to enable continental flora and fauna to reach these and
   other isolated oceanic islands.

   collected only as dead shells ranged from 13% to 52% (mean = 31.6%),

AB Dinoflagellate cysts are widespread in Australian, Papua-New Guinea, New
   Zealand and Southern Ocean Pleistocene and Recent marine sediments. They
   occur in estuaries and deltas as well as on the continental shelf and in
   ocean basins. They have proven invaluable in palaeoecology for the
   interpretation of changing temperature, salinity and distance from shore
   in particular. These changes have also been used to examine climate
   change in Quaternary sequences. A small number of First Appearance
   Datums (FADs) and Last Appearance Datums (LADs) within this time period
   allows only limited biostratigraphic definition. LADs within the
   Pleistocene of southern Australia include Achomosphaera ramulifera and
   Spiniferites rubinus. Introduction within the past 50 years of several
   taxa, such as Gymnodinium catenatum and Gymnodinium microreticulatum,
   has been attributed to ballast water import.
