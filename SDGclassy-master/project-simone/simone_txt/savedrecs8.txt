AB We classified and characterized precipitation features (PFs) at annual
   and diurnal timescales during 1998-2011 over the tropical Americas and
   adjoining oceans using data from two instruments on board the Tropical
   Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM). Our scope included geographic
   distribution, frequency, area, rainfall rate, and polarization-corrected
   temperatures (PCTs) of PFs in an effort to contrast different regions
   over Colombia, the Amazon River Basin, and the adjoining oceanic regions
   (Pacific Ocean and Caribbean Sea). Our results showed that mesoscale
   convective systems (MCSs) over the Caribbean Sea exhibited colder
   minimum PCTs than Pacific Ocean MCSs. Pacific Ocean MCSs had higher
   rainfall rates, however, than Caribbean Sea MCSs. Despite the fact that
   MCSs represented <1% of the total precipitation systems found, the MCSs
   contributed more rainfall over the study regions. Over the Pacific
   Ocean, for example, MCSs contributed approximately 57% of the total
   rainfall contributed by all precipitation systems identified over that
   region. Additionally, MCSs over the Pacific coast have their maximum
   frequency during the morning hours (0000-0600 Local Time) offshore and
   centred over the Pacific Ocean at 77.5 degrees W. The annual cycle of
   PFs showed a marked bimodal annual cycle over Colombia, whereas over the
   Amazon Basin, Pacific Ocean, and Caribbean Sea, PFs were characterized
   by a unimodal annual cycle.

AB Kick 'em Jenny is the only known currently active submarine volcano in
   the Lesser Antilles. The volcano has erupted at least 10 times since
   first being discovered in 1939 and the summit has shoaled from a depth
   of similar to 232 m in 1962 to its present-day depth of similar to 150
   m. Kick 'em Jenny is located in a province of explosive volcanism, has a
   known history of explosive eruptions and erupts magma of an explosive
   type. Future eruptions are likely to become increasingly more violent as
   the effect of the overlying water pressure becomes less. A preliminary
   study (Smith and Shepherd, 1993) suggests that Kick 'em Jenny is a prime
   candidate for tsunamigenic eruptions on a potentially hazardous scale,
   possibly affecting the whole of the eastern Caribbean region.
   The classic approach to problems of water waves generated by sudden
   disturbances of the free surface makes use of the Cauchy-Poisson-Lamb
   theory. A large number of theoretical developments to this theory have
   been made for specific forms of surface disturbance. A development by
   Unoki and Nakano (1953a, b) considers both two- and three-dimensional
   Cauchy-Poisson waves generated by finite initial elevations and impulses
   applied to a free surface of infinitely deep water. Unoki and Nakano's
   results compared well to the wave systems recorded following submarine
   eruptions of the Myojinsho Reef volcano in 1952-53.
   Given the similarity of the two situations, Unoki and Nakano's theory is
   applied to Kick 'em Jenny to provide estimates of potential
   Cauchy-Poisson wave heights throughout the eastern Caribbean for a range
   of eruption magnitudes. The results show that, although the waves
   generated are unlikely to pose much of a threat to the eastern Caribbean
   as a whole, they should be considered a hazard to the islands
   immediately adjacent to the volcano including Grenada, the Grenadines,
   and St Vincent.

AB This analysis examines temporal changes in water quality of the Port
   Honduras Marine Reserve (PHMR), Belize from 1998 to 2015. Trends in
   dissolved oxygen (DO), salinity, temperature and pH were analyzed from
   ten sites throughout PHMR for statistically significant relationships.
   Maintaining satisfactory water quality is critical for sustaining
   healthy fisheries. PHMR represents a unique link between upland
   watersheds and coastal wetlands, mangroves, coral reefs, and seagrass
   beds. These ecosystems comprise important habitat for many fisheries
   including the economically valuable sport fish species of Megalops
   atlanticus (Atlantic tarpon), Albula vulpes (bonefish) and Trachinotus
   falcatus (permit). Sport fishing in the PHMR area has become
   increasingly popular in recent decades and is responsible for generating
   direct and indirect income opportunities for local communities,
   including Punta Gorda, the largest town in southern Belize. As a result,
   degradation of water quality of PHMR through land-based human activities
   could have ecological and economic consequences for southern Belize. The
   results of the analyses revealed significant seasonal variations and
   slight increasing trends in DO and salinity at several sampling sites.
   These relatively stable results are likely related to several factors
   including limited coastal development and low population density of
   southern Belize. This study provides baseline information for future
   research and outlines recommendations for management strategies of PHMR
   to mitigate impacts from current and future threats to water quality.

   heavily upon a rich biodiversity, of which the marine environment is an
   obvious example. Marine natural product research has spawned several
   drugs and many other candidates, some of which are the focus of current
   clinical trials. The sponge megadiversity of Papua New Guinea is a rich
   but underexplored source of bioactive natural products. Here, we review
   some of the many natural products derived from PNG sponges with an
   emphasis on those with interesting biological activity and, therefore,
   drug potential. Many bioactive natural products discussed here appear to
   be derived from non-ribosomal peptide and polyketide biosynthesis
   pathways, strongly suggesting a microbial origin of these compounds.
   With this in mind, we also explore the notion of sponge-symbiont
   biosynthesis of these bioactive compounds and present examples to
   support the working hypothesis.

AB The Caribbean region shows maxima in easterly winds greater than 12 in
   s(-1) at 925 hPa in July and February, herein referred to as the summer
   and winter Caribbean low-level jet (LLJ), respectively. It is important
   to understand the controls and influences of the Caribbean LLJ because
   other LLJs have been observed to be related to precipitation
   variability. The purpose of this study is to identify the mechanisms of
   the Caribbean LLJ formation and variability and their association to the
   regional hydroclimate. Climatological fields are calculated from the
   North American Regional Reanalysis and the 40-yr ECMWF Re-Analysis from
   1979 to 2001. It is observed that the low-level (925 hPa) zonal wind
   over the Caribbean basin has a semiannual cycle and an interannual
   variability, with greater standard deviation during boreal summer. The
   semiannual cycle has peaks in February and July, which are regional
   amplifications of the large-scale circulation. High mountains to the
   south of the Caribbean Sea influence the air temperature meridional
   gradient, providing a baroclinic structure that favors a stronger
   easterly wind. The boreal summer strengthening of the Caribbean LLJ is
   associated with subsidence over the subtropical North Atlantic from the
   May-to-July shift of the ITCZ and the evolution of the Central American
   monsoon. Additionally, the midsummer minimum of Caribbean precipitation
   is related to the Caribbean LLJ through greater moisture flux
   divergence. From May to September the moisture carried by the Caribbean
   LLJ into the Gulf of Mexico is strongest. The summer interannual
   variability of the Caribbean LLJ is due to the variability of the
   meridional pressure gradient across the Caribbean basin, influenced by
   tropical Pacific variability during summer.

AB Resource specialization is a key concept in ecology, but it is
   unexpectedly difficult to parameterize. Differences in resource
   availability, sampling effort and abundances preclude comparisons of
   incompletely sampled biotic interaction webs. Here, we extend the
   distance-based specialization index (DSI) that measures trophic
   specialization by taking resource phylogenetic relatedness and
   availability into account into a rescaled version, DSI*. It is a
   versatile metric of specialization that expands considerably the scope
   and applicability, hence the usefulness, of DSI. The new metric also
   accounts for differences in abundance and sampling effort of consumers,
   which enables robust comparisons among distinct guilds of consumers. It
   also provides an abundance threshold for the reliability of the metric
   for rare species, a very desirable property given the difficulty of
   assessing any aspect of rare species accurately. We apply DSI* to an
   extensive dataset on interactions between insect herbivores from four
   folivorous guilds and their host plants in Papua New Guinean
   rainforests. We demonstrate that DSI*, contrary to the original DSI, is
   largely independent of sample size and weakly and non-linearly related
   with several host specificity measures that do not adjust for plant
   phylogeny. Thus, DSI* provides further insights into host specificity
   patterns; moreover, it is robust to the number and phylogenetic
   diversity of plant species selected to be sampled for herbivores. DSI*
   can be used for a broad range of comparisons of distinct feeding guilds,
   geographical locations and ecological conditions. This is a key advance
   in elucidating the interaction structure and evolution of highly
   diversified systems.

AB Invasive predators typically have larger effects on native prey
   populations than native predators, yet the potential roles of their
   consumptive versus non-consumptive effects (CEs vs. NCEs) in structuring
   invaded systems remains unclear. Invasive lionfish (Pterois volitans)
   may have ecosystem-level effects by altering native fish grazing on
   benthic algae that could otherwise displace corals. Lionfish could
   reduce grazing by decreasing the abundance of herbivorous fishes (CEs),
   and/or the predation risk posed by lionfish could alter grazing behavior
   of fishes (NCEs). To test for these CEs, we manipulated lionfish
   densities on large reefs in The Bahamas and surveyed fish populations
   throughout June 2009-2011. In July 2011, NCEs of lionfish were measured
   by observing fish grazing behavior on algal-covered substrata placed in
   microhabitats varying in lionfish presence at different spatial scales,
   and quantifying any resulting algal loss. Lionfish reduced small
   herbivorous fish density by the end of the 2010 summer recruitment
   season. Grazing by small and large fishes was reduced on
   high-lionfish-density reefs, and small fish grazing further decreased
   when in the immediate presence of lionfish within-reefs. Lionfish had a
   negative indirect effect on algal loss, with 66-80 % less algae removed
   from substrata in high-lionfish-density reefs. Parrotfishes were likely
   driving the response of herbivorous fishes to both CEs and NCEs of
   lionfish. These results demonstrate the importance of considering NCEs
   in addition to CEs of invasive predators when assessing the effects of
   invasions.

   (climatic wet season) and April 2011 (climatic dry season). Observations
   are based on helicopterborne and ground-based measurements in an area of

   observations at the Barbados Cloud Observatory located at the East coast
   of Barbados since early in 2010 and which provides a longer-term context
   for the CARRIBA measurements. The deployed instrumentation and sampling
   strategy are presented together with a classification of the
   meteorological conditions. The two campaigns were influenced by
   different air masses advected from the Caribbean area, the Atlantic
   Ocean, and the African continent which led to distinct aerosol
   conditions. Pristine conditions with low aerosol particle number
   concentrations of similar to 100 cm(3) were alternating with periods
   influenced by Saharan dust or aerosol from biomass burning resulting in
   comparably high number concentrations of similar to 500 cm(3). The
   biomass burning aerosol was originating from both the Caribbean area and
   Africa. The shallow cumulus clouds responded to the different aerosol
   conditions with a wide range of mean droplet sizes and number
   concentrations. Two days with different aerosol and cloud microphysical
   properties but almost identical meteorological conditions have been
   analyzed in detail. The differences in the droplet number concentration
   and droplet sizes appear not to show any significant change for
   turbulent cloud mixing, but the relative roles of droplet inertia and
   sedimentation in initiating coalescence, as well as the cloud
   reflectivity, do change substantially.

   for the estimation of coal consumption data for twenty countries from
   1856 to 2000, plus Cuba and Chile from 1840. The conclusion is that coal
   consumption was a matter of the large and medium sized economies
   (Brazil, Mexico, Argentina, Chile, Colombia, Venezuela). The six small
   Central American republics, all together, never got above the 1% of the
   regional consumption. The Dominican Republic did not reach 0,5% and
   Haiti rarely surpassed 0,01% of the coal consumed in the region, a high
   figure for Bolivia, Ecuador and Paraguay in some years. The exception
   among the small ones being Uruguay, which behaved as the large ones.
   What is behind coal consumption in fact was not size but economic
   backwardness.

   average accessible good land per household. Although Vanuatu is often
   considered as not densely populated (19 hab/km(2)), results indicate
   great variation among islands. The average area of good land per
   household varies from 530 ha on the island of Tegua (North) to 0.5 ha on
   Futuna (South). Shifting cultivation does not appear to be a serious
   threat to the environment. The establishment of coconut plantations and
   permanent pastures represents the main cause of deforestation and
   contributes to increased pressure on land used for food production. The
   integration of layers of data is a powerful tool for improving
   environmental planning in an archipelago under growing human pressure
   and natural changes.

AB Existing archaeobotanical and palynological records of plant use in the
   northern New Guinea lowlands are reviewed in light of recent work at Kuk
   and theoretical refocusing on plant use practice. A practice-based
   approach is supported as the most useful way of investigating the highly
   problematical area of tropical plant food production. The existing
   direct record of past plant use in lowland New Guinea is considered
   woefully inadequate to achieve this task, as is that in Near Oceania and
   Island Southeast Asia. Archaeobotanical methods exist to fill the void,
   but full implementation requires a change in general archaeological and

AB Optimal foraging models predict that large predators should concentrate
   on large prey in order to maximize their net gain of energy intake.
   Here, we show that the largest species of sea turtle, Dermochelys
   coriacea, does not strictly adhere to this general pattern. Field
   observations combined with a theoretical model suggest that a 300 kg
   leatherback turtle would meet its energetic requirements by feeding for
   3-4 h a day on 4 g jellyfish, but only if prey were aggregated in
   high-density patches. Therefore, prey abundance rather than prey size
   may, in some cases, be the overriding parameter for foraging
   leatherbacks. This is a classic example where the presence of small prey
   in the diet of a large marine predator may reflect profitable foraging
   decisions if the relatively low energy intake per small individual prey
   is offset by high encounter rates and minimal capture and handling
   costs. This study provides, to our knowledge, the first quantitative
   estimates of intake rate for this species.

AB Variability in spatial and temporal patterning of flowering by
   populations of rainforest trees fed upon by honeyeaters and
   flower-visiting parrots was studied for 2 years in lowland tropical hill
   forest in Papua New Guinea. All 2200 trees in a 3 ha plot were tagged,
   identified, mapped and monitored monthly. Of 274 tree species present,
   86 flowered during the course of the study; during any given month,
   approximately 20% of the species flowering that month were visited by
   nectarivorous birds. Results showed that overall flower resources (total
   number of species, and number of bird-pollinated species, individuals
   and flowers) fluctuated during the year, decreased during the dry season
   and increased during the wet season. In addition, there was a wide range
   of temporal variation within and among tree species in length and timing
   of flowering period, percentage of each conspecific population flowering
   from year to year, and degree of synchrony among flowering conspecifics.
   Spatial dispersion of tree populations also varied, from clumps to
   scattered single individuals. Resident bird species were correlated with
   synchronously flowering trees, whereas nomadic bird species were
   correlated with asynchronously flowering trees. Resident birds were also
   associated with smaller blooming displays per tree, whereas nomadic
   birds were associated with trees that bloomed massively. There was no
   correlation between avian nomadism and spatial dispersion of tree
   populations. Thus nomadic birds seem to range in search of rich but
   unpredictable resources; resident birds may rely more on predictable,
   but smaller resources.

AB Alpheid shrimp represent an abundant and diverse, but poorly
   characterized, component of the cryptic biodiversity of coral reefs
   worldwide. Sponge-inhabiting alpheids provide a promising model system
   for exploring patterns of cryptic reef biodiversity because their
   habitats (hosts) are discrete and qualitatively distinct units. We
   tabulated data from 14 years of collections at Carrie Bow Cay, Belize to
   quantify patterns of diversity, host specificity, and dominance among
   sponge-dwelling shrimp (Synalpheus), with special attention to eusocial
   species. From > 600 sampled sponges of 17 species, we recognized at
   least 36 Synalpheus shrimp species. Of these, 15 (42%) were new to
   science. Species accumulation curves suggest that we have sampled most
   of the Synalpheus diversity at Carrie Bow Cay. Diversity of
   sponge-dwelling Synalpheus was slightly higher in shallow water,
   probably because of greater habitat diversity, than in deep water. Host
   specificity was surprisingly high, with > 50% of all shrimp species
   found in only a single sponge species each, although some shrimp species
   used as many as six hosts. Cohabitation of individual sponges by
   multiple shrimp species was rarer than expected by chance, supporting
   previous distributional and behavioural evidence that competition for
   hosts is strong and moulds patterns of host association. The fauna of
   most well-sampled sponge species was dominated, both in numbers of
   individuals and in frequency of occurrence, by eusocial species.
   Eusocial shrimp species also inhabited a significantly greater number of
   sponge species than did non-social shrimp. Consequently, > 65% of shrimp
   in our quantitative samples belonged to the four eusocial species, and
   on a per-species basis, eusocial species were 17 times as abundant as
   non-social species. Our data suggest that the highly diverse
   sponge-dwelling shrimp assemblage of the Belize Barrier Reef is
   structured by competition, and that eusociality has allowed a small
   number of species to dominate the sponge resource.

AB Migratory animals endure high stress during long-distance travel in
   order to benefit from spatio-temporally fluctuating resources, including
   food and shelter or from colonization of unoccupied habitats. Along with
   some fishes and shrimps, nerite snails in tropical to temperate
   freshwater systems are examples of amphidromous animals that migrate
   upstream for growth and reproduction after a marine larval phase. Here I
   report, to my knowledge, the first example of 'hitchhiking' behaviour in
   the obligatory migration of animals: the nerite snail Neritina
   asperulata appears to travel several kilometres as minute juveniles by
   firmly attaching to the shells of congeneric, subadult snails in streams
   of Melanesian Islands, presumably to increase the success rate of
   migration.

AB Empirical evidence indicates that both niche breadth and resource
   availability are key drivers of a species' local abundance patterns.
   However, most studies have considered the influence of either niche
   breath or resource availability in isolation, while it is the
   interactive effects that are likely to influence local abundance. We
   examined geographic variation in the feeding ecology and distribution of
   coral-feeding butterflyfish to determine the influence of dietary
   specialization and dietary resource availability on their local
   abundance. Dietary composition and abundance of five butterflyfish and
   coral dietary resource availability were determined at 45 sites across
   five locations (Lizard Island and Heron Island, Great Barrier Reef;
   Kimbe Bay, Papua New Guinea; Noumea, New Caledonia; and Moorea, French
   Polynesia). Multiple regression models using variables representative of
   total dietary resource availability, availability of specific dietary
   resources, and interspecific competition were used to determine the best
   predictors of local abundance across all sites and locations for each
   species. Factors influencing local abundance varied between
   butterflyfish with specialized and generalized diets. Dietary resource
   availability had the strongest influence on the abundance of Chaetodon
   trifascialis-the most specialized species. Local abundance of C.
   trifascialis was best predicted by availability of the Acropora corals
   that it preferentially feeds on. In contrast, abundance of generalist
   butterflyfish was poorly described by variation in availability of
   specific resources. Rather, indices of total dietary resource
   availability best predicted their abundance. Overall, multiple
   regression models only explained a small proportion of the variation in
   local abundance for all five species. Despite their relatively
   specialized diets, dietary resource availability has limited influence
   on the local abundance of butterflyfish. Only the most specialized
   species appear to be consistently limited by prey availability. Local
   and total abundance of species are influenced by a wide range of
   different factors and there is definite need to conduct independent
   species assessments.

AB Background: Kiribati, a remote atoll island country of the Pacific, has
   serious problems of vitamin A deficiency (VAD). Thus, it is important to
   identify locally grown acceptable foods that might be promoted to
   alleviate this problem. Pandanus fruit (Pandanus tectorius) is a
   well-liked indigenous Kiribati food with many cultivars that have
   orange/yellow flesh, indicative of carotenoid content. Few have been
   previously analysed.
   Aim: This study was conducted to identify cultivars of pandanus and
   other foods that could be promoted to alleviate VAD in Kiribati.
   Method: Ethnography was used to select foods and assess acceptability
   factors. Pandanus and other foods were analysed for beta- and
   alpha-carotene, beta-cryptoxanthin, lutein, zeaxanthin, lycopene and
   total carotenoids using high-performance liquid chromatography.
   Results: Of the nine pandanus cultivars investigated there was a great
   range of provitamin A carotenoid levels (from 62 to 19 086 mu g
   beta-carotene/100 g), generally with higher levels in those more deeply
   coloured. Seven pandanus cultivars, one giant swamp taro (Cyrtosperma
   chamissonis) cultivar and native fig (Ficus tinctoria) had significant
   provitamin A carotenoid content, meeting all or half of estimated daily
   vitamin A requirements within normal consumption patterns. Analyses in
   different laboratories confirmed high carotenoid levels in pandanus but
   showed that there are still questions as to how high the levels might
   be, owing to variation arising from different
   handling/preparation/analytical techniques.
   Conclusions: These carotenoid-rich acceptable foods should be promoted
   for alleviating VAD in Kiribati and possibly other Pacific contexts
   where these foods are important. Further research in the Pacific is
   needed to identify additional indigenous foods with potential health
   benefits.

AB The ability for small islands to meet sustainability goals is
   exacerbated by the costs of transporting goods on, and then, wastes off
   the islands. At small scales, recycling can be prohibitive and
   complicated by labor costs; the need to profitably recycle and manage
   solid waste output from tourism is complicated by scale and available
   technologies. A multi-year study documents the amount of solid waste
   generated on Great Exuma (Exuma), The Commonwealth of The Bahamas since
   2010 with one year of benchmarking, then limited recycling of food waste
   generation by an all-inclusive resort, Sandals Emerald Bay (SEB). For
   the island of Exuma, the rapid increase in the rate of accumulation of
   solid waste associated with a large destination resort has led to an
   increase in pests such as rats and flies, along with an increased
   occurrence of fires associated with unburied solid waste. Solid waste
   has accumulated faster than the island solid waste management can
   absorb. SEB kitchen and hotel operations contributes an estimated 36% of
   all solid waste generated on the island, about 1752t(1) out of a total
   of 4841 t generated on the island in 2013 (exclusive of vegetation
   waste). Based on 4 weeks of benchmarking, 48.5% of all the waste coming
   out of the SEB resort is compostable, organic waste, but waste
   composition varies widely over time. Exuma Waste Management (EWM) and
   Recycle Exuma (RE), both privately-held Bahamian businesses, worked for
   one year (2012-2013) with SEB resort to implement a benchmarking and
   pilot recycling project to meet Earth Check green resort certification
   requirements. This paper outlines the costs and resources required for
   food waste recycling and some barriers to implementing more effective
   solid waste management for the tourism industry on small islands. (C)

AB Aims To examine species richness patterns in Papua New Guinea's
   terrestrial vertebrates and test for geographical congruence between the
   four classes, and between lizard and snake subgroups. To assess the
   environmental correlates of Papua New Guinean terrestrial-vertebrate
   richness, and contrast effects of varying analytical resolution and
   correction for spatial autocorrelation. We predict congruence in the
   bird, mammal and to a lesser extent amphibian richness, with weak
   congruence or incongruence between reptiles and the other taxonomic
   groups. We further predict these patterns will stem from relative or in
   the case of reptiles dissimilar, correlative trends with environmental
   predictors such as elevation and temperature.
   Location Papua New Guinea.
   Methods Having created and updated distribution maps for reptiles, we
   compare them with known ranges of amphibians, birds and mammals and
   generate species richness grids at quarter-, half- and one- degree
   spatial resolutions. We examine congruence in species richness between
   vertebrate groups and between reptile subgroups. We employed
   spreading-dye models to simulate species richness according to eight
   environmental predictors and one random model. We accounted for spatial
   autocorrelation in all analyses.
   Results Papua New Guinean amphibian, bird and mammal species richness
   are spatially congruent, a trend which strengthens with decreasing
   spatial resolution. Reptiles and the lizard and snake subgroups reveal
   remarkably different spatial-richness trends. Elevational predictors,
   particularly elevational range at coarse resolutions, provide the
   strongest correlates of species richness. Terrestrial-vertebrate
   richness increases with elevation, whereas reptile richness decreases.
   Main conclusions Congruent species richness gradients in Papua New
   Guinea are observed in most terrestrial vertebrates, except reptiles.
   Topographic heterogeneity and associated climatic clines promote
   diversity in most terrestrial vertebrates but appear to strongly
   constrain reptile diversity. The topographical complexity and climatic
   stratification of tropical mountains clearly present a wealth of
   opportunities for diversification in most terrestrial vertebrate groups.
   As reptiles are strongly constrained by temperature, tropical mountains
   present more of a diversification barrier for them.

AB Companion vector-borne diseases (CVBDs) are an important threat for pet
   life, but may also have an impact on human health, due to their often
   zoonotic character. The importance and awareness of CVBDs continuously
   increased during the last years. However, information on their
   occurrence is often limited in several parts of the world, which are
   often especially affected. Latin America (LATAM), a region with large
   biodiversity, is one of these regions, where information on CVBDs for
   pet owners, veterinarians, medical doctors and health workers is often
   obsolete, limited or non-existent. In the present review, a
   comprehensive literature search for CVBDs in companion animals (dogs and
   cats) was performed for several countries in Central America (Belize,
   Caribbean Islands, Costa Rica, Cuba, Dominican Republic, El Salvador,
   Guatemala, Honduras, Mexico, Nicaragua, Panama, Puerto Rico) as well as
   in South America (Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Ecuador,
   French Guiana, Guyana (British Guyana), Paraguay, Peru, Suriname,
   Uruguay, Venezuela) regarding the occurrence of the following parasitic
   and bacterial diseases: babesiosis, heartworm disease, subcutaneous
   dirofilariosis, hepatozoonosis, leishmaniosis, trypanosomosis,
   anaplasmosis, bartonellosis, borreliosis, ehrlichiosis, mycoplasmosis
   and rickettsiosis. An overview on the specific diseases, followed by a
   short summary on their occurrence per country is given. Additionally, a
   tabular listing on positive or non-reported occurrence is presented.
   None of the countries is completely free from CVBDs. The data presented
   in the review confirm a wide distribution of the CVBDs in focus in
   LATAM. This wide occurrence and the fact that most of the CVBDs can have
   a quite severe clinical outcome and their diagnostic as well as
   therapeutic options in the region are often difficult to access and to
   afford, demands a strong call for the prevention of pathogen
   transmission by the use of ectoparasiticidal and anti-feeding products
   as well as by performing behavioural changes.

   at investigating the gastrotrich diversity of the Tropical North-Western
   Atlantic (TNWA). A new macrodasyidan gastrotrich is described from
   fine-medium sand collected at Duncans Bay, Jamaica. The description is
   based on observations carried out on living specimens using differential
   interference contrast microscopy. Paraturbanella xaymacana sp. n., the
   third gastrotrich taxon reported from Jamaica, is a mid-sized species,
   up to 564 mu m long, with a feeble peribuccal swelling. The most obvious
   autapomorphic traits pertain to the testes and the male pore, both of
   which are located approximately at mid body, rather than at-or near the
   pharyngo-intestinal junction as occur in the other species of the genus.
   Additional differences with congeners are discussed and a key to the
   Paraturbanella species is provided, in the hope it will be useful to
   both gastrotrich experts and marine ecologists who discover these
   microscopic metazoans during their research.

AB In this article, I argue for placing the politics of translation and
   theories of value and spatial production at the center of environmental
   anthropology. For the past ten years, the Gimi-speaking peoples living
   in Maimafu village, Papua New Guinea, have taken part in an integrated
   conservation and development project attempting to foster a local system
   of valuing "nature" by tying biological diversity to economic markets
   through the creation of "eco-enterprises." However, the project fails to
   consider how Gimi produce, theorize, transmit, and express knowledge.
   Using ethnographic material concerned with hunting and song composition,
   I show that Gimi under-stand their forests to be part of a series of
   transactive dialectical relationships that work to produce identity and
   space. I also demonstrate that, as part of this project, Gimi social
   relations with their forests have been translated in ways that fit their
   beliefs into generic and easily understandable categories. This has been
   detrimental to the conservation project and it is politically
   problematic for an engaged environmental anthropology.

   life-history traits of Caribbean gambusia, Gambusia puncticulata
   puncticulata, using collections representing dry and wet periods from
   eight pond sites located across the three Cayman Islands. Caribbean
   gambusia exhibited a seasonal life-history response over the 5-month
   interval between the relatively dry and wet periods, marked by shifts to
   larger adult sizes and smaller broods made up of larger offspring. This
   seasonal shift in the life-history pattern coincided with increased
   rainfall, lower salinity, lower water temperature, and higher food
   availability. Overall, there was a reproductive trade-off involving a
   reciprocal relationship between brood size and mean embryo mass, and a
   direct relationship between brood size and total embryo mass. Levels of
   various environmental variables, including salinity, submerged aquatic
   vegetation cover, and capture depth, were apparently unrelated to the
   life-history pattern. Furthermore, the life-history pattern did not
   reflect an island effect. However, a correlation between the seasonal
   difference in salinity and offspring size suggested that the Cayman
   Island life-history pattern may correspond in part with the
   environmental stability hypothesis.

AB INTRODUCTION: The epidemiologic transition has made chronic disease a
   major health threat in the Caribbean and throughout the world. Our
   objective was to examine the pattern of lifestyle factors associated
   with cardiovascular disease (CVD) in Grenada and to determine whether
   the prevalence of CVD risk factors differs by subgroups.
   METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional study of adult Grenadians
   between 2005 and 2007. We used a population-wide, community-based
   approach by adapting the World Health Organization's STEPwise Approach
   to the Surveillance of Chronic Disease survey for a local context. We
   collected behavioral, anthropometric, and blood sample data to assess
   the prevalence of CVD risk factors.
   RESULTS: An estimated 64% (n = 2,017) of 3,167 eligible adults
   participated in our study (60% women). With increasing age, consumption
   of fried foods declined, whereas fish intake increased. Adults aged 45
   to 54 years had the highest obesity rate (39%). Large waist
   circumference was more common among women than among men. According to
   National Cholesterol Education Program criteria, 29% of participants had
   metabolic syndrome (47% ≥ 65 y; 36% women vs 17% men). Approximately
   one-fifth of participants had lived outside Grenada for more than 10
   years. Participants who had migrated tended to be older and have
   different CVD risk factors than those who had never migrated.
   CONCLUSION: In the midst of an epidemiologic transition in the Caribbean
   nation of Grenada in which CVD risk is increasing, dietary risk factors
   are most prevalent among women and among all adults younger than 55.

AB There are few published studies quantifying the volume of wildlife being
   traded through Singapore. We report on Singapore's involvement in the
   trade of avifauna listed on CITES based on government-reported data to
   CITES, with particular emphasis on Singapore's role in the trade of the
   globally threatened African grey parrot Psittacus erithacus. During
   2005-2014 Singapore reported commercial import permits for 225,561
   birds, from 35 countries, listed on CITES Appendices I and II, and the
   export of 136,912 similarly listed birds to 37 countries, highlighting
   the country's role as a major international transshipment hub for the
   global aviculture industry. Major exporters to Singapore included the
   Solomon Islands, the Netherlands, Taiwan, the Democratic Republic of the
   Congo, and South Africa. Major importers from Singapore included Taiwan,
   the United Arab Emirates and Japan. Singapore imported significant
   quantities of CITES-listed birds from African countries, including the
   Central African Republic, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Guinea
   and South Africa, a number of which have a history of abuse of CITES
   export permits, discrepancies in reported trade data, or an acknowledged
   lack of wildlife law enforcement capacity. Significant discrepancies
   were detected between import and export figures of CITES-listed avifauna
   reported by Singapore and its trading partners. Based on these findings
   we present three recommendations to improve the regulation and
   monitoring of the trade in CITES-listed bird species in Singapore.

AB Leptachirus is described as a new genus of Soleidae for Aseraggodes
   klunzingeri (Weber) and eight new species from fresh or brackish water
   habitats in southern New Guinea and northern Australia formerly
   identified as A. klunzingeri. Leptachirus is differentiated from
   Aseraggodes, all species of which are marine, by its more slender body
   (depth 2.7-3.55 in SL), the corner of its jaws exposed on the cheek,
   usually 3 or 4 pelvic rays, shorter pelvic fins, each usually with 3 or
   4 rays, and different pattern of its cephalic lateralis sensory system.
   The type species, L. alleni, is from the Bintung River, New Guinea; L.
   bensbach, L. kikori, and L. lorentz are named for the rivers in New
   Guinea in which they were collected; L. robertsi is from the Fly River
   in Papua New Guinea; L. darwinensis, very similar to L. bensbach, from
   the East and South Alligator Rivers and the Adelaide River of the
   Northern Territory of Australia; L. polylepis, with a high lateral-line
   scale count of 103-111, from the East, West, and South Alligator Rivers
   and the Mary River; and L. triramus from the Victoria River of Northern
   Territory and the nearby Ord River of Western Australia. The last
   species is the most divergent, having three instead of two branches of
   the lateral line on the ocular side of the head, and the pelvic fin of
   that side attached to the genital papilla. The holotype of L.
   klunzingeri Weber, described from one specimen collected in the mouth of
   the Merauke River, New Guinea, has been lost. Weber's illustration shows
   a fish with a deeper body and broader interorbital space than the other
   eight species. Additional species of Leptachirus might be expected from
   other rivers of New Guinea and northern Australia are better collected.

   larvae to replenish the shallower reefs. Yet, the distribution, status,
   and ecological roles of deep (> 30 in) Caribbean reefs are not well
   known. In this report, an observation of a deep reef which has undergone
   a recent extensive loss of coral cover is presented. In stark contrast
   to the typical pattern of coral loss in shallow reefs, the deeper corals
   were most affected. This report is the first description of such a

AB The 'drive hunting' of dolphins has a long history in the Solomon
   Islands, specifically at the island of Malaita. In 2010, the most active
   village, Fanalei, suspended hunting in exchange for financial
   compensation from an international non-governmental organization but
   resumed hunting again in early 2013. Here, we report on a visit to
   Fanalei in March 2013 to document the species and number of dolphins
   killed in the renewed hunting. Detailed records for the 2013 hunting, up
   to the time of our visit, included at least 1500 pantropical spotted
   dolphins (Stenella attenuata), 159 spinner dolphins (Stenella
   longirostris) and 15 'bottlenose' dolphins, probably Tursiops truncatus.
   Molecular identification confirmed two of the species, pantropical
   spotted and spinner dolphins. A summary of all available records from
   1976 to 2013 documented a minimum total of 15 454 dolphins killed by the
   Fanalei villagers alone. We also found the local price of a dolphin
   tooth had increased from about US$0.14 (SBD$1) in 2004 to about US$0.70
   (SBD$5) in 2013. The large number of dolphins killed and the apparent
   incentive for future hunting offered by the increasing commercial value
   of teeth, highlight an urgent need to monitor hunts and assess the
   abundance and trends in local populations.

AB To investigate the paternal population history of New Guinea, 183
   individuals from 11 regional populations of West New Guinea (WNG) and
   131 individuals from Papua New Guinea (PNG) were analyzed at 26 binary
   markers and seven short-tandem-repeat loci from the nonrecombining part
   of the human Y chromosome and were compared with 14 populations of
   eastern and southeastern Asia, Polynesia, and Australia. Y-chromosomal
   diversity was low in WNG compared with PNG and with most other
   populations from Asia/Oceania; a single haplogroup (M-M4) accounts for
   75% of WNG Y chromosomes, and many WNG populations have just one Y
   haplogroup. Four Y-chromosomal lineages (haplogroups M-M4, C-M208,
   C-M38, and K-M230) account for 94% of WNG Y chromosomes and 78% of all
   Melanesian Y chromosomes and were identified to have most likely arisen
   in Melanesia. Haplogroup C-M208, which in WNG is restricted to the Dani
   and Lani, two linguistically closely related populations from the
   central and western highlands of WNG, was identified as the major
   Polynesian Y-chromosome lineage. A network analysis of associated
   Y-chromosomal short-tandem-repeat haplotypes suggests two distinct
   population expansions involving C-M208-one in New Guinea and one in
   Polynesia. The observed low levels of Y-chromosome diversity in WNG
   contrast with high levels of mtDNA diversity reported for the same
   populations. This most likely reflects extreme patrilocality and/or
   biased male reproductive success (polygyny). Our data further provide
   evidence for primarily female-mediated gene flow within the highlands of
   New Guinea but primarily male-mediated gene flow between highland and
   lowland/coastal regions.

AB Approximately 56 species of land and freshwater birds have been recorded
   as migrants or vagrants in the Mariana Islands, but few occur in
   substantial numbers. Common migrants include the Tufted Duck (Aythya
   fuligula), Northern Pintail (Anas acuta), and Cattle Egret (Bubulcus
   ibis). Several other heron and duck species appear most years in small
   numbers. The Barn Swallow (Hirundo rustica) is the only regular migrant
   land bird. A similar assemblage of herons and waterfowl has been
   reported from the Ogasawara and Iwo Islands to the north. Many more
   species of migrant land birds occur in the Ogasawara and Iwo groups and
   in Palau to the southwest, which are closer to large land masses.

AB The study of genetic variation in fungi has been poor since the
   development of the theoretical underpinnings of population genetics,
   specifically in marine taxa. Corollospora maritima sensu lato is an
   abundant cosmopolitan marine fungus, playing a crucial ecological role
   in the intertidal environment. We evaluated the extent and distribution
   of the genetic diversity in the nuclear ribosomal internal transcribed
   spacer region of 110 isolates of this ascomycete from 19 locations in
   the Gulf of Mexico, Caribbean Sea and Pacific Ocean. The diversity
   estimates demonstrated that C. maritima sensu lato possesses a high
   genetic diversity compared to other cosmopolitan fungi, with the highest
   levels of variability in the Caribbean Sea. Globally, we registered 28
   haplotypes, out of which 11 were specific to the Caribbean Sea, implying
   these populations are genetically unique. We detected populations
   inhabiting human-impacted sites with null genetic variation. As
   long-term exposure to contaminants has been proven to decrease genetic
   diversity, a conservation genetics approach to assess this matter is
   urgent. Our results revealed the occurrence of five genetic lineages
   with distinctive environmental preferences and an overlapping
   geographical distribution, agreeing with previous studies reporting
   physiological races within this species.

AB Trinidad and Tobago are continental shelf islands, connected with South

   became isolated from South America only similar to 1.5 kya and Tobago
   became isolated similar to 12 kya. Because of this former connection,
   these islands have many South American species not found on islands of
   the Lesser Antilles that were never connected to South America. I
   collected nine species of acrobat ants (Crematogaster) in Trinidad and
   Tobago: Crematogaster brasiliensis, Crematogaster carinata,
   Crematogaster crinosa, Crematogaster crucis, Crematogaster curvispinosa,
   Crematogaster limata, Crematogaster nigropilosa, Crematogaster rochai,
   and Crematogaster tenuicula. All these species have broad ranges in
   South and Central America. Only two, C. crinosa and C. curvispinosa, are
   also known from multiple islands of the Lesser Antilles north of

AB Elasmobranch populations in The Bahamas offer a unique juxtaposition to
   the widespread decline of many species around the world, largely due to
   management and conservation initiatives implemented over the last 25
   years. Several industries have been built around the diverse and
   abundant elasmobranch assemblages found in The Bahanias, however a
   comprehensive assessment of the non-consumptive economic value of this
   resource has yet to be undertaken. In this study, we identified various
   sectors that benefit from elasmobranch populations in The Bahamas, which
   included tourism, film and television and research. We incorporated data
   from operator and participant surveys, government sources and
   information available on the Internet to calculate the economic value
   and location of these various sectors. This study establishes The
   Bahamas dive industry as the largest in the world, contributing
   approximately $113.8 million USD annually to the Bahamian economy in
   direct and value added expenditures. Elasmobranch tourism generated 99%
   of the total revenue, and the balance generated by film and television
   and research. The relative economic importance of shark diving was
   greater in economically disadvantaged out-islands where specific
   charismatic species are sought. This was also in locations where a large
   proportion of the revenue generated by those activities does not enter
   the Bahamian economy. The sustained national stewardship demonstrated by
   the Bahamian government will ensure that this important economic
   resource continues to be productive, but also highlights the need for
   regional Caribbean-wide commitment to the management of highly migratory
   species that are important to many economically depressed areas of The
   Bahamas. (C) 2017 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB The sea urchin Diadema antillarum was the most important herbivore on
   Caribbean reefs until 1983, when mass mortality reduced its populations
   by more than 97%. Knowledge of its past demography is essential to
   reconstruct reef ecology as it was before human impact, which has been
   implicated as having caused high pre-mortality Diadema abundance. To
   determine the history of its population size, we sequenced the ATPase 6
   and 8 region of mitochondrial DNA from populations in the Caribbean and
   in the eastern Atlantic (which was not affected by the mass mortality),
   as well as from the eastern Pacific D. mexicanum. The Caribbean
   population harbours an order of magnitude more molecular diversity than
   those of the eastern Pacific or the eastern Atlantic and, despite the
   recent mass mortality, its DNA sequences bear the genetic signature of a
   previous population expansion. By estimating mutation rates front
   divergence between D. antillarum and D. mexicanum, that were separated
   at a known time by the Isthmus of Panama, and by using estimates of
   effective population size derived from mismatch distributions and a
   maximum likelihood coalescence algorithm, we date the expansion as
   having occurred no more recently than 100 000 years before the present.
   Thus, Diadema was abundant in the Caribbean long before humans could
   have affected ecological processes; the genetic data contain no evidence
   of a recent, anthropogenically caused, population increase.

AB Natural geochemical signatures in calcified structures are commonly
   employed to retrospectively estimate dispersal pathways of larval fish
   and invertebrates. However, the accuracy of the approach is generally
   untested due to the absence of individuals with known dispersal
   histories. We used genetic parentage analysis (genotyping) to divide 110
   new recruits of the orange clownfish, Amphiprion percula, from Kimbe
   Island, Papua New Guinea, into two groups: "self-recruiters" spawned by
   parents on Kimbe Island and "immigrants" that had dispersed from distant
   reefs (> 10 km away). Analysis of daily increments in sagittal otoliths
   found no significant difference in PLDs or otolith growth rates between
   self-recruiting and immigrant larvae. We also quantified otolith Sr/Ca
   and Ba/Ca ratios during the larval phase using laser ablation
   inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry. Again, we found no
   significant differences in larval profiles of either element between
   self-recruits and immigrants. Our results highlight the need for caution
   when interpreting otolith dispersal histories based on natural
   geochemical tags in the absence of water chemistry data or known-origin
   larvae with which to test the discriminatory ability of natural tags.

AB Many rural households in the developing world are subject to chronic
   seasonal food insecurity. Often cited among coping strategies is
   foraging for wild foods. This study was to understand the role of wild
   food in household food security in Timor-Leste. Information on wild food
   use comes from three sources: a) a longitudinal study of food
   consumption among 14 subsistence farmer households across four districts
   in 2006-2007; b) a survey in 2011 of 1,800 farmer households across all
   13 districts in Timor-Leste; and c) a survey of 64 households from eight
   community seed groups in three districts in 2013. The consumption of
   wild food fluctuated widely across the year with consumption much
   reduced in the wet season (December - April) compared to the dry season
   (May - November). Wild food use in a normal year - 2006-2007 and a
   food-deficit year - 2011, characterized by a severe hungry season, were
   compared. In the normal year the maize grain store was exhausted in 50 %
   of households (expressed as cumulative percentage of 'at risk'
   households) during the month of August and the percent of households
   consuming wild food was 9.2 %. By contrast in the food deficit year,
   maize grain stores were typically exhausted 2 months earlier than in a
   normal year, and 50 % of all interviewed households were foraging for
   wild food by May in four districts. Clearly in the food deficit season
   wild food foraging was dramatically increased compared to a normal year,
   particularly by poor at-risk households. The early depletion of grains
   store stocks under food insecurity resulted in greater coincidence of
   the period of wild food foraging with the hungry season than in a normal
   year. In two surveys there were clear differences between districts in
   the extent of wild food foraging. The most widely eaten wild plant foods
   in Timor-Leste are lesser yam (Dioscorea esculenta considered wild in
   Timor-Leste) followed by elephant's foot yam (Amorphophallus
   paeoniifolius) and bitter bean (Phaseolus lunatus). Looking to the
   future in Timor-Leste, the wild food resource will continue to provide
   an important food buffer in deficit years especially to poor at-risk
   households, increasing their resilience and reducing their
   vulnerability.

AB Large cyclonic and anticyclonic eddies are found in the Caribbean Sea.
   Analysis of sea level data from the TOPEX/POSEIDON altimeter shows that
   the eddies are quite regular, appearing at near 3-month intervals west
   of the southern Lesser Antilles. These eddies progress westward at
   average speeds of 12 cm s(-1), growing in amplitude up to 20 cm. Many
   eddies dissipate in the coastal waters of Nicaragua a half year after
   they appear. A 1/6 degrees x 1/6 degrees general circulation model of
   the Atlantic is shown to reproduce major features of the eddy life
   cycle, including their amplitudes, temporal scales, and propagation
   speed. Analysis of the model output further suggests that the eddies are
   mainly limited to the thermocline and above, with little phase lag in
   the vertical. The simulated eddies have sufficiently strong currents
   that the horizontal gradient of total vorticity changes sign, suggesting
   that conversions from mean to eddy kinetic energy may be contributing to
   their growth. Analysis of the simulation links eddies in the Caribbean
   with eddies formed outside the Caribbean at the confluence of the North
   Brazil Current and North Equatorial Countercurrent systems.

AB An area of rainforest in Trinidad (10 degrees N, 61 degrees W) is
   remarkably rich in biodiversity, and receives the highest amount of
   rainfall in the island due to its orography and the dominant northeast
   trade winds. However, a year-round transfer of water from its pristine
   rivers is likely in the future, with ecological consequences. The
   results of a pilot study are presented, based on a simple, and
   graphical, segment-scale multi-objective methodology for the estimation
   of the optimal instream flow of the 13 rivers in this area. This
   methodology is based on a dimensionless ecohydrological factor, A, which
   enables the required hydraulic mean depth at a river cross-section to be
   expressed in terms of the average species length at maturity for a
   target group of amphibians, birds, fish, mammals and reptiles. Moreover,
   the methodology considers the socio-economic cost of ecological
   degradation brought about by streamflow abstraction, as well as the
   economic benefit of the same. An example illustrates the estimation of
   optimal instream flow for a value of A and, thereby, the corresponding
   optimal river intake operating rule, based on the hydraulic
   characteristics of a 0.1 km segment of one of the rivers, for the
   20-year average dry (January-May) and wet (June-December) seasons. The
   limitations of the pilot study, and areas for further research, are also
   highlighted with a hope that it will ultimately evolve into a
   decision-making tool for water resources management.

AB Parasitic micro-organisms can influence multiple ecological processes,
   from growth, mortality, and behavior, to community structure and trophic
   interactions, yet are typically ignored components of marine
   biodiversity. We collected 1298 blood samples from reef fishes off 6
   eastern Caribbean islands, representing 27 families, 57 genera and 103
   species, including invasive Indo-Pacific lionfish. Members of 14 species
   from 8 families were infected, comprising damselfishes (Pomacentridae),
   parrotfishes (Scaridae), mullet (Mugilidae), jacks (Caranjidae),
   Blennies (Blenneidae and Labrisomidae), snappers (Lutjanidae), and
   angelfishes (Pomacanthidae). None of the 8 distinct blood parasites
   found fit descriptions of other Caribbean parasites, but resembled
   typical Haemogregarina-like intraerythrocytic parasites and
   Haemohormidium-like parasites collected from fishes on the Great Barrier
   Reef (GBR), Australia. No blood parasites were found in lionfish and
   there was surprisingly little overlap in the families of Caribbean and
   GBR fishes. Most infected species were strongly diurnal. The high
   incidence of infection in Stegastes damselfishes was particularly
   surprising and has potentially important ecological consequences, given
   that damselfishes influence benthic community structure and are prey for
   reef piscivores. Gnathiid isopods, an apparent vector of apicomplexan
   blood parasites in other systems, were common at sampling sites and
   collected for use in transmission experiments. Haemogregarina-like
   parasites were taken up by gnathiids that fed on infected blennies. By
   comparison, when gnathiids fed on Stegastes damselfish infected with a
   Haemohormidium-like parasite, no parasites were found. This study
   reveals the high biodiversity of haemoparasites infecting eastern
   Caribbean reef fishes, and highlights the need for additional research
   throughout the Caribbean and in other tropical reef systems.

AB The planthopper Zophiuma butawengi (Heller) causes Finschhafen Disorder
   (FD) of coconut and oil palm in Papua New Guinea (PNG). Field surveys
   for parasitoids of Z. butawengi were conducted between November 2007 and
   February 2009. Of the 1059 egg masses collected, 41% were found to be
   parasitized by an encyrtid (Ooencyrtus sp.) or a mymarid (Parastethynium
   maxwelli (Girault)) while no parasitoids were recovered from nymphs or
   adults. Wasps of Ooencyrtus sp. were responsible for 74.8% of the
   parasitism with the remaining 24.6% caused by P. maxwelli. The average
   progeny produced per egg mass by Ooencyrtus sp. and P. maxwelli was 20
   and 23, respectively, both with female biased sex ratios of 70% and 68%,
   respectively. P. maxwelli was common on the island of West New Britain
   but absent from mainland PNG sites, hence offering an opportunity for
   classical biological control. Laboratory experiments showed that adult
   longevity of both parasitoids was markedly enhanced by honey and this
   finding will prove important in future mass rearing attempts for
   inundative biological control of Z. butawengi. Further experiments
   involved testing nectar plants as potential food source to the
   parasitoids. Access to flowers of potential food plants did not
   significantly improve longevity over a no-food and water treatment.
   There was a strong response to honey diet, suggesting that screening a
   wider range of plants is worthwhile to develop conservation biological
   control. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB The Caribbean islands contain an enormous ecological variety, and with
   the influx of people, they are left with denuded forests and
   disappearance of animals and people.  Despite their limited size, these
   islands could sustain development with their own water, vegetation,
   soil, air, and wildlife resources.  The Exclusive Economic Zones,
   approved by the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea, extends the
   coastline up to 200 miles, thus providing an increased amount of
   resource area.  However, these natural resources are abused in various
   ways.  Some of the white sand beaches are disappearing due to growing
   tourism.  Furthermore, these islands are vulnerable to hazardous wastes
   and nuclear tests and other destructive natural forces that produce a
   dramatic change in the climate.  To counteract this environmental
   degradation, the government implemented environmental initiatives that
   protect these natural resources with the aid of international agencies
   and organizations.  These islands, though seen as a small capsule,
   represent the problems of the world magnified many times.

AB Disturbance can impact natural communities in multiple ways. However,
   there has been a tendency to focus on single indicators of change when
   examining the effects of disturbance. This is problematic as classical
   diversity measures, such as Shannon and Simpson indices, do not always
   detect the effects of disturbance. Here, we instead take a multilevel,
   hierarchical approach, looking for signatures of disturbance in the
   capacity and diversity of the community, and also in allocation and
   demography at the population level. Using recreational use as an example
   of disturbance, and the freshwater streams of Trinidad as a model
   ecosystem, we repeatedly sampled the fish communities and physical
   parameters of eight pairs of recreational and nonrecreational sites
   every 3months over a 28-month period. We also chose the Trinidadian
   guppy (Poecilia reticulata) as the subject of our population-level
   analyses. Regression tree analysis, together with analysis of deviance,
   revealed that community capacity and community species richness were
   greater at sites with higher levels of recreational use. Interestingly,
   measures of community diversity that took into account the proportional
   abundance of each species were not significantly associated with
   recreational use. Neither did we find any direct association between
   recreational use and proportion of guppy biomass in the community.
   However, population-level differences were detected in the guppy: Sex
   ratio was significantly more female-biased at more disturbed sites. Our
   findings emphasize the importance of considering multiple levels when
   asking how disturbance impacts a community. We advocate the use of a
   multilevel approach when monitoring the effects of disturbance, and
   highlight gaps in our knowledge when it comes to interpreting these
   effects.

   dominated by the shrub Piper aduncum L. that originates from South
   America. Here we report on its seed bank, growth rate and biomass
   accumulation. P. aduncum accounted for 69 % (408 m(-2)) of the seed bank
   in the forest and 53 % (1559 m(-2)) of the seed bank under fallow. About
   90 % of the tree seed bank at the fallow site was dominated by P.
   aduncum whereas this was 78 % in the forest soil. Two-year-old P.
   aduncum had grown to 4.5 m height and had accumulated 48 Mg dry matter
   (DM) per ha of above ground biomass. The rate of biomass accumulation
   increased from 10 Mg DM ha(-1) y(-1) in the first year to 40 Mg DM
   ha(-1) y(-1) in the second year when 76 % of the biomass consisted of
   mainstems. The highest growth rate of 134 kg DM ha(-1) d(-1) occurred
   when P. aduncum was 17-mo-old. Aggressive invasion and monospecific
   stands of P. aduncum are explained by its dominance in the seed bank,
   fast growth, and high rates of biomass accumulation. P. aduncum is a
   major competitor to indigenous tree species and presents a threat to
   Papua New Guinea's rich biodiversity.

   mudstone unit which extends the palaeoecological distribution of this
   crinoid. Uintacrinus socialis proves that the Inoceramus Shales are of

AB Knowledge of the spatial ecology and movement of animals contributes to
   our understanding of intra- and inter-specific interactions and
   ecosystem dynamics, and can inform conservation actions. Here we
   assessed the space use and activity levels of a marine predator, the
   Caribbean reef shark (Carcharhinus perezi), in coastal regions of
   Eleuthera, The Bahamas over a 60-day period using acoustic telemetry. Of
   the 14 adult sharks (eight males, six females) tagged with acoustic
   transmitters (equipped with accelerometer sensor), nine were detected in
   a 14 km(2) gridded receiver array. Male sharks were significantly less
   likely to be detected over time relative to females. Given post-release
   survival is typically high in C. perezi, this finding may indicate that
   males have larger home ranges and may exhibit lower site fidelity
   compared to females. Patterns of space use indicated C. perezi primarily
   occupied the outer reef shelf and were rarely detected on the interior
   of the reef. Shark activity levels (inferred from acceleration profiles)
   were highest in close proximity to the reef shelf. Our findings indicate
   C. perezi individuals frequently occupy deeper water habitats, but make
   forays into reef shelf habitats where high activity levels are likely
   related to foraging.

AB This study contrasts the pattern of low-frequency (LF) and
   high-frequency (HF) climate variability in the eastern Caribbean. A
   low-pass Butterworth filter is used to study oscillations in rainfall
   and regional SST on time scales of greater and less than 8 yr in the
   period 1901-2002. The results show that the southern and northern
   Antilles are dominated by HF variability, whereas rainfall fluctuations
   in the eastern Antilles oscillate at quasi-decadal periods over the
   102-yr record. In the southern Antilles, the HF rainfall signal derives
   from a late-summer response to the ENSO phase: warm and dry versus cool
   and wet. In the northern Antilles, the HF signal relates to a
   combination of an ENSO and North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) phase: a
   warm ENSO and a negative NAO bring wetter conditions, while a cool ENSO
   and a positive NAO bring drier conditions. The early rainfall LF signal
   in SST is characterized by a dipole between the North Atlantic and South
   Atlantic and is associated with cross-equatorial winds that promote
   convection in the Caribbean. The study analyzes the upper-ocean
   structure-in particular, a low (high) salinity signal in the tropical
   North Atlantic (North Pacific) that relates to LF (HF) climate
   variability.

AB Background: The prevalence of chronic diseases is increasing in West
   Africa, the Caribbean and its migrants to Britain. This trend may be due
   to the transition in the habitual diet, with increasing (saturated) fat
   and decreasing fruit and vegetable intakes, both within and between
   countries. Objective: We have tested this hypothesis by comparing
   habitual diet in four African-origin populations with a similar genetic
   background at different stages in this transition.
   Design: The study populations included subjects from rural Cameroon (n =
   743), urban Cameroon (n = 1042), Jamaica (n = 857) and
   African-Caribbeans in Manchester, UK (n = 243), all aged 25-74 years.
   Habitual diet was assessed by a food-frequency questionnaire,
   specifically developed for each country separately. Results: Total
   energy intake was greatest in rural Cameroon and lowest in Manchester
   for all age/sex groups. A tendency towards the same pattern was seen for
   carbohydrates, protein and total fat intake. Saturated and
   polyunsaturated fat intake and alcohol intake were highest in rural
   Cameroon, and lowest in Jamaica, with the intakes in the UK lower than
   those in urban Cameroon. The percentage of energy from total fat was
   higher in rural and urban Cameroon than in Jamaica and the UK for all
   age/sex groups. The opposite was seen for percentage of energy from
   carbohydrate intake, the intake being highest in Jamaica and lowest in
   rural Cameroon. The percentage of energy from protein increased
   gradually from rural Cameroon to the UK.
   Conclusions: These results do not support our hypothesis that
   carbohydrate intake increased, while (saturated) fat intake decreased,
   from rural Cameroon to the UK.

AB Jamaica is a small island of 4,440sq. miles in the Caribbean Sea. In its
   effort to provide meaningful control of pesticide use within limited
   resources, regulations were recently passed through the Ministry of
   Health to license the pesticide industry including manufacturers,
   importers, retailers and pest control operators. To attain financial
   self-reliance for the Pesticides Control Authority (PCA) - the statutory
   agency mandated to carry out this control, a fee of 2% of CIF value of
   each pesticide imported was embodied within the regulatory framework.
   The industry, along with the agricultural sector vigorously opposed the
   fee claiming excessive increases in cost of production of food. As the
   PCA carries out regulation to improve pesticide efficiency, is it to the
   benefit of the farmers to accept this cost? Is not the consumer the
   final group that pays? Is the increase in efficiency from training and
   awareness programmes along with quality control not far more valuable
   than the cost of the import fee? Is it time for the international
   community to collectively endorse such measures toward reducing
   pesticide misuse and abuse so as to reduce risks to users, consumers and
   the environment in food production in developing countries?

AB We occupied 38 fish stations at Navassa Island in April-May 1999: 22
   rotenone collections, mostly by scuba diving; 4 night light/dip net
   stations; 5 hook and line, trolling and hand-lining stations; and 7
   visual underwater surveys. Eight new cryptic species were collected with
   rotenone - five blennioids, two clingfishes, and a goby. Five have
   already been described and three are described in papers currently in
   press. New information is given on the behaviour and life colours of one
   of the recently described blennioids, Emblemaria vitta. We collected or
   recorded 224 species of fishes from 66 families, verifying most earlier
   records and adding another 160 species, making a current total of 237
   species known from Navassa. Of the 224 species recorded, 102 (45.5%)
   were taken only with rotenone, and 56 others were collected using
   rotenone and other techniques. Thus a total of 158 species (70.5%) were
   collected using rotenone, supporting the need for this technique in
   obtaining a complete inventory. Most fishes found at Navassa are
   reef-associated species that are widely distributed in the Caribbean
   Sea. Navassa is relatively depauperate when compared with Bermuda (433
   species of fishes) and four western Caribbean oceanic atolls (273
   fishes). Navassa shares 140 fish species with Bermuda and 139 fish
   species with the western Caribbean atolls. Navassa, like Bermuda and the
   western Caribbean atolls, lacks families associated with the continental
   shelf such as toadfishes, searobins, and snooks. Navassa also lacks
   families associated with shallow seagrass beds and forage fishes such as
   herrings and anchovies. Navassa has similar numbers of gobioids (14 vs.
   19 species in Bermuda), damselfishes (9 vs. 10), surgeonfishes (3),
   triggerfishes (5 vs. 6), squirrelfishes (7 vs. 8), and cardinalfishes
   (11 vs. 12); but fewer eels (14 vs. 32), jacks (7 vs. 17), grunts (3 vs.
   7), wrasses (10 vs. 16), snappers (4 vs. 11), parrotfishes (9 vs. 13),
   and serranids (21 vs. 29); and more blennioids (24 vs. 11), plus
   clingfishes (6) and jawfishes (2), families that are absent from
   Bermuda.

AB The relationship between HIV (human immunodeficiency virus), food
   security and nutrition has become increasingly important to
   practitioners, policy makers and people living with HIV. In this paper
   we describe for the first time the connection between HIV and
   antiretroviral therapies, the extent of nutritional counselling for
   HIV-positive people and food security in Papua New Guinea (PNG). A total
   of 374 HIV-positive people who were over the age of 16 and who had been
   on antiretroviral therapy (ART) for more than two weeks were recruited
   from six provinces, using a non-probability, convenience sampling
   methodology. A subsample of 36 participants also completed an in-depth
   qualitative interview. Participants received nutritional advice when
   beginning ART which focused on three main domains, of which the first
   two were the most frequently mentioned: what foods to avoid; what foods
   to eat; and how frequently to eat. 72% of the sample reported that they
   had experienced an increase in their appetite. Of those who reported
   that their appetite had increased on ART 33% reported that they did not
   have enough food to satisfy hunger. People who lived in the capital
   city, Port Moresby, within the Southern Region of PNG, had significantly
   more difficulty with food security than those who lived in other regions
   of the country. Not having enough food was the third most commonly
   recorded reason for non-adherence to ART. Responses to the HIV epidemic
   in Papua New Guinea must also begin to address the phenomenon of food
   insecurity for people with HIV, in particular those who are receiving
   antiretroviral therapies and who live in the urban areas.

   established which were visited in January and February 1999. The
   samplings were made by emersions with light diving equipment and by
   qualitative visual census in situ. Samples of complex identification
   were collected for their laboratory classification. The salinity
   variation was of 37 part for a thousand in the stations nearer to the
   open sea and 48 part for a thousand in periferic water. Four species of
   marine fanerogamas were found, 17 species of algae, 49 of invertebrates
   (9 belonging to Phylum Porifera, 7 to Phylum Cnidaria, 18 to Phylum
   Mollusca, 2 to Phylum Annelida, 7 to Phylum Artropoda, 5 to Phylum
   Echinodermata y 1 to Phylum Chordata) and 28 species of fish. None of
   the species identified in this study belong only to this zone, nore are
   they in danger of extinction nor over exploited. In spite of the intense
   nautical activity and of the previous drilling work the nature of the
   system has allowed the maintenance of a phase not different from natural
   situations.

AB The Maldives is one of the most vulnerable countries to the projected
   impacts of climate change, due to a combination of the small sizes of
   the islands and their low height above sea level. Like other small
   island developing states, the Maldives depends overwhelmingly on
   petroleum imports for their electricity production, which creates
   serious economic and financial difficulties. The Government of Maldives
   is therefore committed to promote sustainable energy and has been
   actively pursuing several inter-related initiatives to overcome the
   existing barriers to the utilization of renewable energy technologies.
   To assist this, the quantification and evaluation of the potentials of
   available solar and wind resources in the country for electricity
   applications has been performed. The hybrid system design tool HOMER has
   been used to create optimal renewable energy (RE) system designs. In
   order to evaluate these different RE alternatives a multi-criteria
   analysis is performed using a number of criteria that are likely to be
   decisive in implementation decisions. The evaluation shows that fully RE
   system configurations are not financially viable in the Maldives while
   the RE-diesel hybrid systems could bring down the price of electricity
   with 5-10$cent/kWh in smaller outer islands. Assuming that these latter
   systems with a high probability of adoption are implemented, the results
   show that. 10% of the electricity in the Maldives could be supplied by
   RE based systems in a cost effective way. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All

AB The present study investigates the Caribbean Sea rainfall variability
   during the early and late rainy seasons and its association with sea
   surface temperature (SST) and air-sea interaction based on observational
   estimates, the NCEP Climate Forecast System (CFS) and Global Forecast
   System (GFS) simulations, and the CFS retrospective forecasts. Analysis
   of the observational estimates indicates that air-sea interaction is
   important over the Caribbean Sea, whereas the atmospheric forcing of SST
   dominates over the Gulf of Mexico. The CFS simulation captures the basic
   elements of this observed air-sea relationship. The GFS simulation
   produces spurious SST forcing of the atmosphere over the Gulf of Mexico
   largely due to prescribing SST. The CFS forecasts capture the air-sea
   relationship in the late rainy season (August-October), but cannot
   reproduce the SST forcing of atmosphere over the Caribbean Sea in the
   early rainy season (May-July). An empirical orthogonal function (EOF)
   analysis indicates that the leading modes of percent anomalies of the
   rainy season precipitation have the largest loading in the southern
   Caribbean Sea in observations. The model simulations and forecasts
   skillfully reproduce the spatial pattern, but not the temporal
   evolution. The Caribbean Sea rainfall variability in the early rainy
   season is mainly due to the tropical North Atlantic (TNA) SST anomalies
   in observations, is contributed by both the TNA and eastern equatorial
   Pacific (EEP) SST anomalies in the CFS simulation, and has an overly
   large impact from the EEP SST anomalies in the GFS simulation and the
   CFS forecasts. The observed Caribbean Sea rainfall variability in the
   late rainy season has a leading impact from the EEP SST anomalies, with
   a secondary contribution from the TNA SST anomalies. In comparison, the
   model simulations and forecasts overestimate the impacts of the EEP SST
   anomalies due to an earlier development and longer duration of the El
   Nio-Southern Oscillation in the CFS compared to observations.

AB Several studies have shown that urbanization usually leads to severe
   biotic homogenizing, i.e. the local extirpation of many native species
   and the expansion to regional scales of a small group of
   "urban-adaptors", some of them exotics. Margarita Island (Venezuela) is
   a tropical Caribbean island that has undergone an accelerated urban
   development in the last 40 years. Because the island also has a high
   bird diversity with several endemic and threatened species, we evaluated
   the effect of urban development on bird species richness, assemblage
   structure, seasonal changes and feeding guilds. We defined an urban
   gradient from areas with high vegetation cover (remnant woodlands)
   through areas with intermediate vegetation (traditional towns) to areas
   with next to no vegetation (recent suburbs). Each experimental unit was
   replicated 3 times and birds were surveyed during the dry and rainy
   seasons. Richness decreased as urbanization increased, being severely
   depleted in the recent suburbs. The bird assemblage consisted of native
   species, including six endemic sub-species, but only one exotic, Columba
   livia. There were no seasonal changes in assemblage structure. We
   identified the species most tolerant and most sensitive to urbanization.
   Omnivorous birds were common along the gradient and granivores were also
   tolerant to urban development. Specialized insectivores and frugivores
   were the most negatively affected groups. The considerable amount of
   native woodland and other vegetation present in the traditional towns we
   evaluated, and their proximity to natural protected areas, favors the
   persistence of native bird species in these urban areas on Margarita
   Island.

   interrogate Solomon Islands' engagement in the Coral Triangle Initiative
   on Coral Reefs, Fisheries and Food Security to contribute new insight on
   the scalar politics of multi-level marine governance. We show how
   regional objectives are re-interpreted and prioritized as they translate
   into national policy and practice. Our data suggest that enhanced
   coordination of finances and activities, integration of objectives in
   shared protocols and priority geographies, and a subtle shift in power
   relations between the state, donors, and implementation partners have
   resulted from processes of re-scaling. We discuss important procedural
   adjustments in cross-level and cross-scale governance across
   jurisdictional, institutional, and sectoral scales. We also reflect on
   the changing role of national governments in shifts toward large-scale,

   detected in fish tissue from Point Lisas and Caroni. Metal
   concentrations in fish tissue showed significant correlation with
   sediment metals concentration, which suggests that tissue levels are
   influenced by sediment concentration. Of the metals, only Zn. Hg and Cu
   had a bioaccumulation factor (BAF) greater than one, which suggests a
   high bioaccumulation potential for these metals. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

AB In the easternmost part of the Insulindian arc, domestic economies
   display a high level of local diversity, resulting from past
   introductions and experiences; their combination determines flexible
   systems designed to adapt to environments that can be difficult. Besides
   what are presented as main staples such as rice or corn, domestic
   farming systems rely on other crops such as different kinds of tubers or
   beans, while more or less spontaneous plants (palm trees principally)
   provide regular and important food supplies. All of this forms, across
   the region, complete systems based on a combination of plants that
   respond to different social and economic logics and vary over time and
   space. These systems fit into a specific territorial framework that is
   periodically reactivated by specific rituals: the first harvest
   ceremony, the ceremonies to call for rain, etc., found throughout the
   geographical area. The article presents some of these exploitation
   systems specific to the region, notably the ones based upon cereals,
   tubers or palm trees; and focuses on a few rituals that accompany them
   in Timor-Leste, supplemented by some interpretations based on other
   examples derived from the scientific literature on the region.

AB Since the mass mortality of the urchin Diadema antillarum in 1983,
   parrotfishes have become the dominant grazer on Caribbean reefs. The
   grazing capacity of these fishes could be impaired if marine reserves
   achieve their long-term goal of restoring large consumers, several of
   which prey on parrotfishes. Here we compare the negative impacts of
   enhanced predation with the positive impacts of reduced fishing
   mortality on parrotfishes inside reserves. Because large-bodied
   parrotfishes escape the risk of predation from a large piscivore (the
   Nassau grouper), the predation effect reduced grazing by only 4 to 8%.
   This impact was overwhelmed by the increase in density of large
   parrotfishes, resulting in a net doubling of grazing. Increased grazing
   caused a fourfold reduction in the cover of macroalgae, which, because
   they are the principal competitors of corals, highlights the potential
   importance of reserves for coral reef resilience.

AB Gambierdiscus spp. are epiphytic, benthic dinoflagellates. Some species
   have been shown to be toxic and cause ciguatera fish poisoning. We
   report, for the first time, the occurrence of Gambierdiscus caribaeus
   isolated from the waters off Jeju Island in Korea. Its morphology was
   similar to that of the original Belize strains of G. caribaeus.
   Gambierdiscus caribaeus has been reported in the tropical and
   subtropical waters of the Pacific, Gulf of Mexico, Caribbean Sea, and
   Floridian coast. Our report extends its range to the North Pacific
   Ocean. The plates of the Korean strain were arranged in a Kofoidian
   series of Po, 3', 7'', 6c, 6s, 5''', 1p, and 2'''', morphologically
   closer to other strains of G. caribaeus than to G. carpenteri. When
   properly aligned, its small subunit (SSU) rDNA was 0.5% different from
   those of Gambierdiscus sp. C-1, a strain that was isolated from the
   waters off eastern Japan, but was 2.44.0% different from those of the
   NOAA strains of G. caribaeus and 3.13.4% different from those of the
   NOAA strains of G. carpenteri. Additionally, the D1D3 large subunit
   (LSU) rDNA sequence of the Korean strain of G. caribaeus was 4.75.3%
   different from those of the NOAA strains of G. caribaeus and 7.17.5%
   different from those of all reported G. carpenteri strains, including
   the NOAA strains. In phylogenetic trees based on SSU and LSU rDNA
   sequences, our Korean strain was basal to the clade consisting of the
   NOAA strains of G. caribaeus, which in turn was sister clade to all
   reported G. carpenteri strains.

AB The larvacean community was observed during an 18 month period at the
   mouth of eutrophic Kingston Harbour, Jamaica. During this period,
   larvaceans averaged 3607 m(-3) with a biomass of 2.2 mg ash-free dry
   weight m(-3) (32.6 mg AFDW m(-2)) in a community dominated by
   Oiko-pleura longicauda. There were no relationships between larvacean
   biomass and any size fraction of chlorophyll, suggesting that other
   factors must normally regulate larvacean communities. The evidence
   indicates that this regulation is by predation. Annual production by
   larvaceans was 586 kJ m(-2) year(-1) (29.3 g AFDW m(-2) year(-1));
   production of houses could represent an added 300-600 kJ m(-2) year(-1).
   While copepod biomass was 10 times higher than that of the larvaceans
   during the same period, copepod growth rates were only one-third those
   of larvaceans. Thus, larvacean annual production is at least 30% that of
   the copepods, due to their rapid growth rates, and at least 50% that of
   the copepods when house production is considered. The contribution of
   larvaceans to plankton production has been underappreciated historically
   when only their biomass is considered.

AB Radio tracking technology has, for many years, been applied successfully
   to studies of vertebrates. particularly mammals and birds. Recent
   reductions in transmitter size have enabled these techniques to include
   invertebrates. However, perhaps because the radio tracking of
   invertebrates is especially problematic, relatively few studies have
   been carried out. In particular, there are relatively few radio tracking
   studies of decapod crustaceans, especially terrestrial species, Here we
   report the practical use of radio transmitters to track a tropical,
   amphibious fresh-water land crab, Eudaniela garmani, in the rainforests
   of the Caribbean island of Tobago. We include a method for gluing tags
   to the crabs' carapaces which allows individuals to be tracked for
   periods of up to 12 months.

   nov., T. doni sp. nov., T. longidonta sp. nov. and T. taiwanus sp. nov.,
   are described. These species are found in West Pacific waters including
   Japan, Taiwan (mainland and adjacent outlying islands including Dongsha
   Atoll) and Papua New Guinea. The species exhibit morphological
   differences in the scutum, the tergum, and cirri II and III, and form
   distinct clades in a phylogenetic tree based on DNA sequences of two
   genes, 12S rDNA and cytochrome C oxidase subunit I. Three of the five
   species, T. dongshaensis sp. nov., T. conica sp. nov. and T. taiwanus
   sp. nov., have relatively narrow distribution ranges and were recorded
   from the Dongsha Atoll (T. dongshaensis sp. nov. and T. conica sp. nov.)
   and the Taiwanese mainland (T. taiwanus sp. nov.). Trevathana longidonta
   sp. nov. and T. doni sp. nov. have wider distributions. Trevathana
   longidonta sp. nov. was collected from Japan, Taiwan and Dongsha Atoll
   and T. doni sp. nov. was collected from Taiwan, Dongsha Atoll and Papua
   New Guinea. In the waters of Japan, Taiwan and Dongsha Atoll, all the
   recorded Trevathana species inhabit corals of the family Merulinidae.
   However, in Papua New Guinea, T. doni sp. nov. is also recorded in the
   coral Oxypora, belonging to the family Lobophylliidae, and individuals
   living on Lobophyllidae and Merulinidae did not exhibit great variation
   in the divergence of the COI and 12S genes.

AB This paper quantitatively compares water infrastructure interventions
   that prioritize equity with those that prioritize efficiency. The
   community-based model developed by Haiti Outreach (HO) trains
   communities to operate and maintain wells and has clear efficiency gains
   over the status quo aid model in Haiti that gives communities wells:
   HO's wells were 8.7 percentage points more likely to be functioning
   after one year than similarly-constructed wells managed under the status
   quo model. Because HO's model includes user fees, which raise concerns
   about equity, I quantify the equity-efficiency tradeoff posed by
   community-based and aid interventions by determining the preferences of
   a social planner indifferent between these types of water infrastructure
   interventions. Since HO's user fees are only 0.6 percent of median
   income in rural Haiti, under most specifications the efficiency gains of
   the community-based model outweigh the equity concerns addressed by the
   aid model.

AB Agricultural production is a significant contributor to the economy of
   Jamaica, which is situated in the northwestern Caribbean Sea; this
   production is heavily dependent on seasonal rainfall because only
   approximately 10% of Jamaica's cultivated lands are irrigated. Drought
   is a disastrous natural phenomenon that has a significant impact on
   socioeconomics, agriculture, and the environment. In the 2000-2001
   drought experienced in Jamaica, there were crop losses amounting up to
   US$6million. Hence, drought index information is essential for better
   planning for drought impacts and allows for the introduction of
   mitigation measures in the agricultural sector. Therefore, the objective
   of this paper is to evaluate the suitability of both the Standardized
   Precipitation Index (SPI) and the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index
   (NDVI) in reflecting water stressed conditions and irrigation demand
   requirements for three agricultural sites: Savanna-la-Mar in the parish
   of Westmoreland, Beckford Kraal in the parish of Clarendon, and Serge
   Island in the parish of St. Thomas, all in Jamaica. These sites were
   selected based on soil characteristics, historical rainfall data, and
   farming practices. The results indicate that the NDVI provides a
   suitable representation of these areas for only the driest months of the
   year, and that either the one-month or three-month SPI was found to be
   more representative of soil moisture conditions. Furthermore, a
   correlation analysis was also conducted between the SPI and soil
   moisture for El Nino years only, because the El Nino/Southern
   Oscillation phenomenon has been responsible for many of the droughts
   Jamaica has experienced. In these years, good correlations between soil
   moisture and the one-month and three-month SPI were obtained in some wet
   months, in addition to the dry months. This paper provides soil moisture
   values for all of the different categories and values of the SPI
   relating to water scarcity. It also provides irrigation requirements for
   the moderately dry and severely dry SPI drought categories.

AB The Pacific Equatorial Undercurrent (EUC) transports water originating
   from a number of distinct source regions, eastward across the Pacific
   Ocean. It is responsible for supplying nutrients to the productive
   eastern Equatorial Pacific Ocean. Of particular importance is the
   transport of iron by the EUC; the limiting nutrient in that region.
   Although the mean circulation and sources of EUC water are reasonably
   well understood, it is unclear how the contribution of water from these
   sources to the EUC vary on seasonal to interannual timescales. Here a
   Lagrangian analysis is applied to the eddy-resolving OFAM3 ocean
   simulation in order to identity variability in the makeup of the EUC
   over an 18 year period (1993-2010). While ENSO has an influence on the
   variability of source transport contributions to the EUC, the signal of
   increased (decreased) transport of water from the LLWBCs during El Nino
   (La Nina) periods does not translate to substantial changes in the
   makeup of the EUC between 165 degrees E and 140 degrees W. It is
   hypothesized that this is due to the large spread in travel times of
   water parcels as they travel from the source regions into the EUC. The
   consequent erosion of transport anomalies generated at the different
   western boundary source regions associated with ENSO may help explain
   why previous studies found little relationship between variability in
   iron fluxes off Papua New Guinea shelves and the chlorophyll response in
   the eastern tropical Pacific.

AB We report an intertidal, bone-rich peat deposit on the windward
   (Atlantic Ocean) coast of Abaco, The Bahamas. The age of the Gilpin
   Point peat (c. 950-900 cal. yr BP) is based on five overlapping
   radiocarbon dates (one each from single pieces of wood of buttonwood
   Conocarpus erectus and sabal palm Sabal palmetto, and single bones of
   the Cuban crocodile Crocodylus rhombifer, Albury's tortoise Chelonoidis
   alburyorum, and green turtle Chelonia mydas). The short time interval
   represented by the charcoal-rich peat suggests rapid sedimentation
   following initial anthropogenic fires on Abaco. The site's diverse snail
   assemblage is dominated by terrestrial and freshwater species. The peat
   is exposed today only during exceptionally low tides, suggesting a lower
   sea level at the time of deposition as well as a degrading shoreline
   during the past millennium. Fossils from Gilpin Point represent a
   late-Holocene vertebrate community at the time of first human presence;
   only 10 of the 17 identified species of amphibians, reptiles, birds, and
   mammals still live on Abaco. Numerous unhealed bite marks on the inside
   of the thick carapaces of the green turtle attest to consumption by
   Cuban crocodiles, which probably scavenged turtles butchered by humans.
   This concept, along with the dense concentration of bones in the peat,
   and charring on some bones of the green turtle and Abaco tortoise,
   suggests a cultural origin of the bone deposit at Gilpin Point, where
   the only Amerindian artifact recovered thus far is a shell bead.

AB The original description of Mugil gaimardianus has created various
   taxonomic problems in the past since the description is ambiguous and
   the type specimen is apparently lost. The name M. gaimardianus could not
   be reliably applied to any known species and was suppressed by the
   International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature (ICZN) (Bulletin of
   Zoological Nomenclature, 51: 286-287, 1994). Nevertheless, karyological
   evidence has shown that there is a species of mullet in Venezuelan
   coastal waters that does not conform to the description of any other
   mullet from the Western Central Atlantic and has the feature of a red
   eye that was often used by earlier authors to define nominal M.
   gaimardianus. The purpose of this study was to make a morphological
   description of these unusual specimens, provide a morphological
   diagnosis from other species of Mugil present in the Caribbean and
   Western Central Atlantic and establish a valid name for the species. (c)

AB Climate change may affect important environmental components of holiday
   destinations, which might have repercussions for tourism-dependent
   economics. This study documents the importance of environmental
   attributes in determining the choice and holiday enjoyment. of tourists
   visiting Bonaire and Barbados, two Caribbean islands with markedly
   different tourism markets and infrastructure. Three hundred and sixteen
   and 338 participants from Bonaire and Barbados, respectively, completed
   standardized questionnaires. Warm temperatures, clear waters and low
   health risks were the most important environmental features determining
   holiday destination choice. However, tourists in Bonaire thereafter
   prioritized marine wildlife attributes (i.e. coral and fish diversity
   and abundance) over other environmental features, whereas tourists in
   Barbados exhibited stronger preferences for terrestrial features,
   particularly beach characteristics. The willingness of tourists to
   revisit these islands was strongly linked to the state of the preferred
   environmental attributes. More than 80% of tourists in Bonaire and
   Barbados would be unwilling to return for the same holiday price in the
   event, respectively, of coral bleaching as a result of elevated sea
   surface temperatures and reduced beach area as a result of sea level
   rise. Climate change might have a significant impact on Caribbean
   tourism economy through alteration of environmental features important
   to destination selection. Island-specific management strategies,, such
   as focusing resources on the protection of key marine or terrestrial
   features, may provide a means of reducing the environmental and economic
   impacts of climate change.

AB Cocos nucifera Linn. was introduced to Mexico by Spanish navigators in
   the middle of the 16th century, from Cape Verde and Santo Domingo to the
   Atlantic coast, and from the Solomon Islands and the Philippines to the
   Pacific coast. These populations remained isolated from one another for
   almost 500 years. Morphological studies on fruit characteristics show
   that coconuts from the two populations are contrasting forms. The
   Atlantic coast populations show a wild type fruit, with angular shape,
   thick husk, thick shell, thick endosperm and low water content. The
   Pacific populations have a domesticated type fruit, with fruit and nut
   more spherical, with a much thinner husk and shell, and higher water
   content. The higher variability observed in the Pacific coast raises the
   possibility of later introductions, also from the Philippines or other
   Pacific islands.

AB Over the past decade, Timor-Leste has aimed to identify and execute
   numerous peace-building and state-building initiatives. Central to the
   country's strategic development plan is the careful management of its
   resources and exports. While the development of downstream industries in
   the oil and gas sector is the tiny nation's strongest source of revenue,
   rehabilitation of its coffee sector has also been flagged for
   development. Although a relatively small player in the global coffee
   trade producing under 0.2 percent of the global coffee supply
   Timor-Leste's coffee sector enjoys one comparative advantage: it
   constitutes the largest single-source producer of organic coffee in the
   world. However, despite attempts to boost this sector's viability
   through fair-trade partnerships and development-oriented agents, the
   complex interplay of myriad structural bulwarks shows just how
   formidable the challenge facing Timor-Leste is. This phenomenon is
   situated within the fraught history of Timor-Leste and the current
   plight of its coffee sector sits within a larger narrative of extreme
   deprivation and asymmetries of power. This article thus considers the
   limits of fair-trade organic coffee exports to address Timor-Leste's
   acute poverty.

AB The mtDNA haplogroup L3e, which is identified by the restriction site
   +2349 MboI within the Afro-Eurasian superhaplogroup M (-3592 HpaI), is
   omnipresent, in Africa but virtually absent in Eurasia (except for
   neighbouring areas with limited genetic exchange). L3e was hitherto
   poorly characterised in terms of HVS-I motifs, as the ancestral HVS-I
   type of L3e cannot be distinguished from the putative HVS-I ancestor of
   the entire L3 (differing from the CRS by a transition at np 16223). An
   MboI screening at np 2349 of a large number of Brazilian and Caribbean
   mtDNAs (encompassing numerous mtDNAs of African ancestry), now reveals
   that L3e is subdivided into four principal clades, each characterised by
   a single mutation in HVS-I, with additional support coming from HVS-II
   and partial RFLP analysis. The apparently oldest of these clades
   (transition at np 16327) occurs mainly in central Africa and was
   probably carried to southern Africa with the Bantu expansion(s). The
   most frequent clade (transition at np 16320) testifies to a pronounced
   expansion event in the mid-Holocene and seems to be prominent in many
   Bantu groups from all of Africa. In contrast, one clade (transition at
   np 16264) is essentially restricted to Atlantic western Africa
   (including Cabo Verde). We propose a tentative L3e phylogeny that is
   based on 197 HVS-I sequences. We conclude that haplogroup Me originated
   in central or eastern Africa about 46,000 (+/- 14,000) years ago, and
   was a hitchhiker of much later dispersal and local expansion events,
   with the rise of food production and iron smelting. Enforced migration
   of African slaves to the Americas translocated L3e mitochondria, the
   descendants of which in Brazil and the Caribbean still reflect their
   different regional African ancestries.

AB The ways that people experience, respond to and pattern recovery from
   major climatic aberrations must be understood within the context of
   existing socioeconomic arrangements and the ethos that informs these.
   This paper describes immediate and longer term impacts of a major
   drought on two populations-Bedamuni and Kubo-Konai-in the interior
   lowlands of Papua New Guinea. Though they occupy similar environments,
   are culturally related and reliant on similar technology and resources,
   these two populations differ in density, intensity of land use, and
   social complexity. The drought of 1997 affected one of the populations
   much more severely, than the other. A comparison of effects on
   subsistence regimes, mobility and social life in the two areas suggests
   that these were mediated by understandings people held of relationships
   with both the environment and other people. Bedamuni pattern their lives
   around an expectation of favorable returns on effort, emphasising
   security of tenure to protect those returns. Kubo-Konai, in contrast,
   pattern their lives around an expectation that availability of resources
   will be often in flux, and emphasise means of ensuring security of
   supply. These understandings are reflected, respectively, in risk-prone
   and risk-averse strategies of subsistence and sociality which directly
   influence vulnerability and responses to disruptive events.

AB Indonesia lies at the centre of biodiversity for corals. However, the
   reefs suffered from extensive human exploitation. Marine Protected Areas
   is thought to be best solution to protect coral reefs ecosystem.
   Understanding genetic diversity is crucial for effective management of
   the MPAs, however genetic diversity is rarely been corporate in
   designing an MPA. Moreover, many MPAs are uneffectively manage due to
   poor designated and demarcated. Raja Ampat which is located in western
   tip of West Papua, was designated as a park to mitigatethreatsand
   protect the valuable marine resources. Scleractinian corals in the genus
   Acropora are among the most dominant distributed in Raja Ampat waters,
   including the species of Acroporahyacinthus. The research aimed to
   analyze genetic diversity and to describe the kinship relationship of
   Acroporahyacinthus between 2 populations: Boo Island and Deer Island,
   Raja Ampat. Genetic marker Cytochrome Oxidase I (CO I) of the
   mitochondrial genome DNA (mtDNA) was used to analyze genetic diversity.
   Reconstruction of phylogenetic tree and genetic diversity were made by
   usingsoftware MEGA 5.05 (Moleculer Evolutionary Genetics Analysis). The
   results of this research indicatecorals A. hyacinthus from Boo Island
   and Deer Island Raja Ampat are in the low category of genetic diversity
   and overall had a close genetic relationship of kinship. This is likely
   due to the small size of the population and few numbers of samples that
   may not represent the population.

AB Sixteen nearshore (<= 1 m water depth) sediment samples, termed Sample
   Set 1, were collected from the eastern and south-western coasts of the
   South East Peninsula (SEP) of St. Kitts. Twelve samples termed Sample
   Set 2 were taken from nearby fringing (6-17 m) and offshore (similar to
   18-25 m) reefs. The sample sets were analysed separately using SHE
   Analysis for Biozone Identification (SHEBI). alpha and beta diversities
   and complementarity. SHEBI is a statistical technique that determines
   abundance biozones (ABs) using the entire vector of species abundances
   in samples, species richness S, the information function H. and the
   equitability index E. Alpha diversity expresses the diversity within an
   AB, while beta, diversity quantifies diversity changes between adjacent
   ABs. Complementarity assesses the permeability of AB boundaries.
   SHEBI divided Sample Set 1 into five ABs but did not distinguish
   separate bays. Beta diversities reflected the highest and lowest a
   diversities at Mosquito Bay and South Friar's Beach \ Frigate Bay
   respectively. Complementarity was highest between two ABs in South
   Friar's Bay, indicating a close relationship between shoreline sediment
   and material marginally farther offshore. It was lowest between
   Whitehouse and South Friar's Bays. The assemblages along this transect
   were rich in Discorbis rosea.
   For Sample Set 2, samples were accumulated for SHEBI by depth. SHEBI
   distinguished four ABs (three on the fringing reefs) characterised by
   differing percentages of Asterigerino carinata, Archaias angulatus and
   Amphistegina gibbosa. Comparison between Sample Sets 1 and 2 indicates
   that during storms sediment moves shoreward from the fringing reefs.
   Foraminifera show that there is less movement of sediment> 63 mu m from
   the shoreline (Sample Set 1) to the fringing and deeper reefs. (C) 2011

AB During 1955-2003, flipper tags were attached to 46,983 green turtles and
   ten turtles were fitted with satellite transmitters at Tortuguero, Costa
   Rica. Eight satellite-tracked turtles stayed within 135 km of the beach
   and probably returned to nest after release. The internesting area is
   more extensive than previously documented. Post-nesting migration routes
   of satellite-tracked turtles varied. Seven turtles swam close to the
   coast and three turtles swam through oceanic waters before moving toward
   nearshore areas. Sea surface height anomaly maps indicate that oceanic
   movements were consistent with the southwestern Caribbean gyre. Circling
   and semi-circling turtles could have been disoriented but submergence
   and surface times suggest they may have been feeding in Sargassum sp.
   concentrations. Rapid post-nesting migrations (mean 2.2 km hr(-1)) ended
   on benthic feeding grounds in shallow waters (< 20 m) off Belize (n =
   1), Honduras (n = 1) and Nicaragua (n = 8). The spatial distribution of
   migration end points (n = 10) and tag returns (n = 4,669) are similar.
   Fishermen in Nicaragua target green turtles along migratory corridors
   and on foraging grounds. Management efforts are urgently needed in
   Nicaragua, particularly in the high-density feeding areas south and east
   of the Witties (N14 degrees 09 W82 degrees 45). The proximity of
   foraging grounds to the nesting beach (mean 512 km) may permit female
   turtles to invest more energy in reproduction and hence the Tortuguero
   population may have greater potential for recovery than other green
   turtle nesting populations. Recovery of the Tortuguero green turtle
   population will benefit countries and marine ecosystems throughout the
   Caribbean, especially Nicaragua.

AB Countries in the Caribbean region, including Belize, are vulnerable to
   coastal erosion. Experts and scholars have assessed the effects of
   coastal erosion in the region in physical and economic terms, most often
   from a sectoral perspective. However, less attention has been directed
   to the localized and nonquantifiable effects of coastal erosion in the
   region. We address this research gap by presenting an empirical study of
   a village in southern Belize that has experienced significant coastal
   erosion since the mid-1980s. Drawing on interviews, a mapping exercise,
   and a literature review, we analyze how villagers are experiencing the
   impacts of coastal change, and what the resulting risks and losses mean
   for the socioeconomic stability of the village. We identify five
   categories of local values affected by coastal erosion, ranging from
   alteration of social activities to the loss of properties. We
   demonstrate that the totality of impacts bear consequences to the
   village's continued viability, which adds uncertainty to the lives of
   local residents.

AB The Indo-Pacific lionfish species Pterois volitans and P. miles are
   piscivorous predators that were introduced probably via aquarium release
   to the northwestern Atlantic approximately 15 yr ago and rapidly spread
   and established through the Greater Caribbean. Possible ecological
   impacts of this invasion on native species are a legitimate cause for
   concern. Despite predictions that lionfishes will extend their range
   throughout most of the eastern coast of South America, they are yet to
   be recorded in Brazil. We present a perspective analysis of the lionfish
   invasion in the southwestern Atlantic by investigating patterns of fish
   species movement across the Amazon-Orinoco plume (AOP), a large
   freshwater and sediment runoff between the Caribbean and the Brazilian
   Provinces that represents a 'porous' barrier to dispersal for reef
   organisms. We analyzed records of species that have recently crossed the
   barrier and found that the Brazilian Pro vince contributes a
   significantly higher proportion of its endemic fauna to the pool of
   crossers, indicating that movements of vagrant species across the AOP
   are more common from Brazil towards the Caribbean than vice versa.
   Nevertheless, despite infrequent migration south wards against the
   currents, our analysis indicates that such migration has occurred
   historically and has resulted in the establishment of new populations.
   Our analysis indicates that a combination of the effects of the AOP and
   prevailing currents along northern Brazil may slow the pace of the
   potential invasion, which could help eradication programs if action is
   taken before lionfishes become widespread and established in Brazil.

   Ocean: L. laurentae Wicksten, 2010 from the East Pacific Rise 13 degrees
   N; L. wera Ahyong, 2009 from the Brothers Seamount, Kermadec Ridge, New
   Zealand; L. pacmanus sp. nov. from the Manus Basin, Bismarck Sea; L.
   shinkaiae sp. nov. from the Okinawa Trough, Japan; and L. thermophilus
   sp. nov. from the Manus and Lau basins, southwestern Pacific. Lebbeus
   laurentae is fully redescribed because the original and subsequent
   descriptions are not totally detailed. Differentiating characters among
   the three new species and close allies are discussed. Previous records
   of Lebbeus species from hydrothermal vents are reviewed.

AB A study of the fauna associated with holothurians from Hansa Bay (Papua
   New Guinea) reveals a new symbiotic association between the holothuroid
   Holothuria (Metriatyla) scabra and the crab Hapalonotus reticulatus. All
   the collected holothurians were infested, but with only one crab per
   holothurian, always in the right respiratory tree near the cloaca.
   Because of its size, H. reticulatus considerably expands the wall of the
   respiratory tree, forming a membranaceous cyst. This association,
   therefore, appears to be parasitic. However, the crab does not feed upon
   host tissue but seems to filter its food from water passing through the
   respiratory tree of its host. The description of two males allows to
   comment upon the taxonomical position of H. reticulatus. We classify H.
   reticulatus in the recently re-established family Eumedonidae. This is
   the first record of a species of Eumedonidae living an association with
   a holothurian.

AB Sea turtles are globally endangered and face daily anthropogenic
   threats, including pollution. However, there is a lack of
   ecotoxicological information on sea turtles, especially in the
   Asia-Pacific region. This study aims to determine pollutant levels of
   foraging green turtles (Chelonia mydas) in South China, including Hong
   Kong, Guangdong and Taiwan, as a basis for their conservation. Scute,
   liver and muscle tissues of stranded green turtles were analysed for
   levels of 17 trace elements and methylmercury (MeHg) (n = 86 for scute
   and n = 14 for liver) and polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) (n = 11
   for muscle and n = 13 for liver). Ten-fold higher levels of Pb, Ba, V
   and Tl and 40-fold greater Cd levels were measured in green turtle
   livers in South China relative to other studies conducted over 10 years
   ago. Measured PBDE levels were also 27-fold and 50-fold greater than
   those reported in Australia and Japan. These results warrant further
   investigation of potential toxicological risks to green turtles in South
   China and their source rookeries in Malaysia, Micronesia, Indonesia,
   Marshall Islands, Japan and Taiwan. Research should target monitoring
   pollutant levels in sea turtles within the West Pacific/Southeast Asia
   regional management unit spanning East Asia to Southeast Asia to fill in
   knowledge gaps, in particular in areas such as Thailand, Vietnam,
   Indonesia, Malaysia and the Philippines where less or no data is
   available and where foraging grounds of sea turtles have been
   identified. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Seabirds, as foragers in marine waters for at least part of their
   lifecycle, encounter the global fishing fleet in search of marine
   resources. While fishing gear is designed to catch fish and
   invertebrates, it also catches unintended species, including seabirds.
   We reviewed bycatch incidence for 378 marine and coastal bird species in
   18 different gear types, and found that 60% (228 species) have been
   recorded interacting with at least one type of fishing gear. At least
   one species from each of the taxonomic groups analyzed (generally at the
   family level) has been documented interacting with fishing gear. With
   respect to two measures of degree of interaction, four families have a
   high degree of documented interaction: Gaviidae (loons or divers),
   Podicipedidae (grebes), Diomedeidae (albatrosses) and Sulidae (boobies
   and gannets). Set and drift gillnets (among the most studied gear
   types), have the greatest number of documented species interactions: 92
   and 88 species, respectively. Hook gear (longlines and handlines) have
   documented interactions with 127 species. Together these four gear types
   have documented bycatch of 193 species. The waters of the Arctic, the
   Caribbean, the Guinea and Canary Currents in the Atlantic, the Indian
   Ocean and Asia have been poorly studied. Particular gear types,
   including industrially deployed seines, and the artisanal fisheries
   sector also constitute significant gaps in our knowledge of seabird
   bycatch patterns worldwide.

AB The surface ocean circulation in the Caribbean Sea is characterized by
   the interaction between anticyclonic eddies and the Caribbean Upwelling
   System (CUS). These interactions lead to instabilities that modulate the
   transfer of kinetic energy up- or down-cascade. The interaction of North
   Brazil Current rings with the islands leads to the formation of
   submesoscale vorticity filaments leeward of the Lesser Antilles, thus
   transferring kinetic energy from large to small scales. Within the
   Caribbean, the upper ocean dynamic ranges from large-scale currents to
   coastal upwelling filaments and allow the vertical exchange of physical
   properties and supply KE to larger scales. In this study, we use a
   regional model with different spatial resolutions (6, 3, and 1 km),
   focusing on the Guajira Peninsula and the Lesser Antilles in the
   Caribbean Sea, in order to evaluate the impact of submesoscale processes
   on the regional KE energy cascade. Ageostrophic velocities emerge as the
   Rossby number becomes O(1). As model resolution is increased
   submesoscale motions are more energetic, as seen by the flatter KE
   spectra when compared to the lower resolution run. KE injection at the
   large scales is greater in the Guajira region than in the others
   regions, being more effectively transferred to smaller scales, thus
   showing that submesoscale dynamics is key in modulating eddy kinetic
   energy and the energy cascade within the Caribbean Sea.

AB Malnutrition is a significant problem in parts of Papua New Guinea,
   including the Lower Jimi Valley. There is evidence of specific
   nutritional deficiencies, such as endemic cretinism, but this study
   focused on protein-energy malnutrition. It found that, in the 1-4 year
   old population of three remote villages in the Jimi, only 26% were
   nutritionally normal, 65% were stunted, 7% were wasted and 2% were
   stunted and wasted. With respect to weight for age, 16% were 80-100%
   weight for age, 77% were 60-80% and 7% were < 60%. These figures are
   considerably higher than those of the National Nutrition Survey of
   1982-1983; although the Survey data originated from the entire Jimi
   District rather than only the villages in this study, these findings
   suggest that malnutrition is a significant and worsening problem in the
   Lower Jimi Valley.

AB Evidence shows that the government of Papua New Guinea is failing to
   provide basic services in health to the majority of its people. Local
   non-government organisations (NGOs), partnered with international NGOs,
   are attempting to fill this gap. With limited resources, these small
   Indigenous organisations must focus much of their effort on training
   that supports self-reliance as the main strategy for communities to
   improve their quality of life. This project explored the training
   content and methodology of Touching The Untouchables (TTU), a small
   Indigenous NGO based in Goroka, Eastern Highlands Province, that has
   trained a network of village volunteers in health promotion and safe
   motherhood.
   Village life imposes multiple demands, from self-sufficiency in food to
   maintaining law and order. There are established attitudes about power
   and dependence, referred to as 'cargo thinking'. Cargo thinking stands
   as a barrier to the necessity of self-reliance, and requires training
   strategies that seek to empower participants to create change from their
   own initiative. Empowerment is understood as oriented towards individual
   people taking collective action to improve their circumstances by
   rectifying disparities in social power and control. To achieve
   self-reliance, empowerment is necessarily operational on the levels of
   person, community and society.
   In addition to being operational on all three levels of empowerment, the
   training content and methodology adopted and developed by TTU
   demonstrate that empowering practice in training employs approaches to
   knowledge that are evidence-based, reflexive, contextual and
   skill-based. Creating knowledge that is reflexive and exploring
   knowledge about the broader context uses special kinds of communicative
   tools that facilitate discussion on history, society and political
   economy. Furthermore, training methodologies that are oriented to
   empowerment create settings that require the use of all three types of
   communication required for cooperative action: dramaturgical, normative
   and teleological communication.
   The success of TTU's training content and methodology demonstrates that
   creating the conditions for achieving collective self-reliance through
   empowerment is a necessary part of primary health promotion in Papua New
   Guinea, and that underlying the success of empowerment oriented training
   are definable types of knowledge and communication.

AB Dolphinfish in the Caribbean are fast growing and short-lived, living
   for about 12 to 18 months in the southern Caribbean and a maximum of 2-3
   years in the north of the region. They are believed to be highly
   migratory, are seasonally abundant, and likely to have a more complex
   stock structure than the larger oceanic epipelagic species. Most of the
   information on dolphinfish in the western central Atlantic comes from
   studies in the waters of the USA and the eastern Caribbean, and there is
   a general paucity of information particularly for stock-based management
   of this species. No Caribbean country undertakes regular assessment of
   dolphinfish, or has put in place any species-specific management
   program. Yield-per-reemit analyses for this species in the eastern
   Caribbean suggest that maximization of Y/R is likely to lead to very low
   levels of mature stock biomass. A stock recruitment analysis does not
   show any dependency of recruitment on stock size within the observed
   stock size range. This suggests that recruitment failure could be sudden
   at some threshold below the minimum observed stock size, probably at
   about one third of the average observed stock size. Given the trends
   observed in landings of dolphinfish, a precautionary approach to
   management is needed for this species in the western central Atlantic.
   Given the migratory, shared nature of the dolphinfish resource, a
   regional approach to assessment and management is required. However, the
   institutional basis for this approach does not currently exist within
   the region in a form that is functional. The membership of the
   International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas (ICCAT)
   does not include any of the small island states where dolphinfish is of
   primary importance. ICCAT would need to establish a regional presence in
   order to serve the needs of Caribbean states. The FAO Western Central
   Atlantic Fishery Commission (WECAFC) does not operate in a mode which
   would allow it to address this issue. The Association of Caribbean
   States is too new to address it within the near future. Subregional
   organizations with fisheries programs, such as the Caribbean Community
   (CARICOM) and the Organisation of Eastern Caribbean States (OECS),
   represent only a subset of states. However, given the ratification of
   United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) and the recent
   International Agreement on Highly Migratory Stocks and Straddling
   Stocks, these organisations could take the initiative to establish a
   regional management programme for dolphinfish.

AB The Upper Miocene to present day Gallego Volcanic Field (GVF) is located
   in northwest Guadalcanal. Solomon Islands, SW Pacific, and potentially
   includes the offshore Savo volcano. The GVF is a multi-centred complex
   covering an area of similar to 800 km(2) on Guadalcanal and a further
   similar to 30 km(2) on the island of Savo, north of west Guadalcanal.
   GVF volcanism is characterised by effusive eruptions of lava, intrusion
   of sub-volcanic plutons, as well as pyroclastic flow and fall deposits
   dominated by block and ash flow deposits. Geochemical analysis of a
   representative suite of samples from the GVF demonstrates that the GVF
   comprise largely a 'main suite' of basalts to andesites and minor
   trachyandesites. The predominant mineralogy of the GVF comprises
   plagioclase, amphibole, clinopyroxene and magnetite-ilmenite. Associated
   with the 'main suite' are cognate nodules composed of hornblendite,
   gabbros, and clinopyroxenite. Interpretation of major and trace element
   geochemistry and petrographic studies suggests that fractionation was
   dominated by early clinopyroxene, and later amphibole + clinopyroxene +
   minor plagioclase. Geochemical features such as the incompatibility of
   Sr suggest that plagioclase largely crystallised en-masse late in the
   fractionation sequence. The presence of amphibole and late fractionation
   of plagioclase is suggestive of derivation from initially water-rich
   magmas. The region is characterised by strong geographically-related
   geochemical variations as evidenced by the Woodlark (and Manus) basins:
   basalts become more arc-like within the ocean basins with decreasing
   distance to the subducting trench. The GVF-Savo volcanoes are spatially
   and geochemically affected by deep N-S fractures that show some evidence
   of sympathetic geochemical variations with distance from the trench
   (e.g. Sr/Y ratios). Comparison with a range of international data for
   Th/Nb vs Pb/Nb and Dy/Yb vs SiO(2) indicate that: amphibole was indeed a
   strong controlling phase on magmatic evolution; garnet had no obvious
   role; there was little sediment input into the source region; that
   relative Pb/Nb enrichments may be linked to similar enrichments within
   the subducting Woodlark basin (and by analogy with the Manus basin and
   its abundant hydrothermal Pb-rich sulphide deposits); and the
   predominant influence on the source region for GVF-Savo was from
   metasomatic fluids and/or melts from the slab subducting at the southern
   trench. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB We examine how sweet sorghum implementation in Haiti could be a
   successful innovation. The hypothesis is that sweet sorghum multiuse
   would permit the combination of its several uses: in food industry
   (grain, fodder), energy producing (biofuel or cooking gel and
   cogeneration) and potable alcohol value chain. We mobilize an analytical
   frame of reference of value chains to study in itinere the conditions
   for a sectorial development of an experimental implementation. The data
   were collected from face-to-face surveys with experts. The results
   revealed that the functioning of sugar cane industry determines specific
   constraints, conditioning the choice of sorghum varieties. These results

AB Papua New Guinea (PNG) is an island state with sovereign rights over
   valuable tuna resources. Historically, PNG captured value from tuna only
   by charging licensing fees to foreign fishing fleets, which relegated
   PNG as a source of raw material for the global tuna industry. To capture
   more value from tuna including much-needed jobs and infrastructure the
   PNG government now offers firms that invest in domestic tuna processing
   plants strategic, long-term fishing licences. This strategy of
   obligating embeddedness enables PNG to reorder the international
   division of labour in the canned tuna sector, but socio-economic
   outcomes are shaped by competition within the global tuna industry, the
   core business strategies of foreign firms and domestic conditions in
   PNG. Ultimately, a state's right to control the terms of access to tuna
   is not synonymous with its ability to shape the local-level consequences
   that emerge as firms comply. These findings reveal the peculiar nature
   of state sovereignty over pelagic marine resources and the complications
   of exploiting them to achieve domestic economic and social objectives.

AB The size composition of green turtles Chelonia mydas in their foraging
   grounds (FGs) in Japanese waters of the northwestern Pacific Ocean has
   suggested that turtles shift their FGs according to their size. To
   elucidate the size-related movements among FGs, we examined whether the
   origin of turtles differed depending on their size at 2 FGs in the
   Ryukyu Archipelago by performing mixed stock analysis using a 380 bp
   fragment of the mitochondrial DNA. At both sites, the Japanese stock
   primarily contributed to the 50-70 cm straight carapace length (SCL)
   size class, while the contribution of the southern stock from Micronesia
   and the Marshall Islands was higher in turtles <50 and >70 cm SCL. Since
   the above size-related differences in stock contribution were maintained
   for at least a decade, they were not attributable to the population
   trends in the Japanese stock. The higher contribution of the Japanese
   stock to the 50-70 cm SCL class suggests the possibility of juvenile
   natal homing by turtles from the Japanese stock, possibly from the main
   islands of Japan. The shift in the contribution of different stocks of
   origin to turtles >70 cm SCL might have resulted from the movements of
   turtles to settle in their adult FGs. Additionally, the present results
   revealed that the Ryukyus are situated at the northern limit of the FGs
   for turtles from southern stocks. We hypothesize that this boundary may
   be created by a lack of adaptation of turtles from southern stocks to
   northern seasonal water temperatures.

AB Food choice of Diadema antillarum Philippi was investigated in 1995 at
   Discovery Bay, Jamaica, using a variety of laboratory experiments. In
   two food choice experiments, D. antillarum was offered five species of
   macroalgae common on shallow fore-reefs away from resident populations.
   The urchin was attracted towards water passing over heavily calcified
   Halimeda opuntia and also over less-calcified species such as Lobophora
   variegata. Sargassum sp. and Galaxaura sp. provoked no response when
   tested against pure seawater. The urchin was not selective when offered
   a variety of algae for consumption. However, when offered H. opuntia or
   Galaxaura sp. alone over a 24-hour period, it consumed more of the
   heavily calcified alga. During six-week experiments, D. antillarum
   consumed considerably more Galaxaura sp. than any other species. For D.
   antillarum to gain enough nutrition to live, it seems that it must feed
   on heavily calcified species at a greater rate than fleshier brown algal
   species. However, prolonged consumption of the heavily calcified H.
   opuntia led to spine loss and test decay in half of the test animals.
   Implications for community development are significant because D.
   antillarum consumed macroalgae previously considered unfavourable to
   other coral reef herbivores. With the slow rise of D. antillarum numbers
   over the Caribbean region, there is the potential for these animals to
   reduce the cover of macroalgae from coral reefs.

AB Groupers (Pisces: Serranidae) of littoral environments of warm-temperate
   and tropical regions have experienced intense fishery exploitation.
   Indicators of intense fishing include declines or change in abundance,
   size, spawning aggregations, and species composition. Surveys of grouper
   were carried out from 1995 to 1997 in the Florida Keys, central Bahamas,
   southeastern Cuba, and the southeastern Dominican Republic to illuminate
   patterns in species composition, abundance, and size, along a gradient
   of relative fishing pressure. We assumed that the diversity,
   composition, density, and size would serve as indicators of fishing
   pressure in these areas. The study locations included 2 national parks
   and a national marine sanctuary, and were categorized as: (1)
   intensively fished with little or no management for groupers
   (southeastern Cuba, southeastern Dominican Republic), (2) intensively
   fished with numerous gear and effort regulations (Florida Keys), (3)
   lightly fished with some gear and effort regulations (northern and
   southern Exuma Gays, Bahamas), and (4) a no-take marine fishery reserve
   closed to fishing (Exuma Gays Land and Sea Park, Bahamas). On each site
   10 to 20 strip transects (20 m x 5 m) were surveyed in water of 1 to 20
   m depth over rocky hard-bottom habitats for density and size of grouper.
   Nine grouper species (2 Cephalopholis spp., 4 Epinephelus spp., and 3
   Mycteroperca spp.) were documented among all areas. Results show that
   areas where grouper fishing was relatively light had greater numbers of
   species, density, and biomass, particularly for larger species such as
   Nassau grouper E. striatus. Classification of groupers by 3 life history
   categories or growth strategies (small, intermediate, and large)
   indicated significant differences in density and biomass among study
   areas. The density and biomass of larger grouper species were
   significantly greater in the no-take marine reserve and lightly fished
   areas than in the more intensively fished areas. In 3 of the areas
   characterized as intensively fished, one of which has several grouper
   fishery regulations, grouper density and biomass were dominated by
   small, non-targeted species such as the graysby C. cruentatus and the
   coney C. fulva. This pattern may indicate a second-order effect of
   fishing, indicative of potential changes in competition or predation.
   No-take marine fishery reserves represent a viable means to protect
   grouper resources, simplifying enforcement relative to complex catch and
   effort regulation, but also potentially alleviating the need to gather
   fisheries-dependent data.

   the subject of attention and controversy during the past 10 years due to
   the efforts of some nations to re-open banned international trade. The
   most recent debate has centred on whether it is appropriate for Cuba to
   harvest hawksbills from shared foraging aggregations within her national
   waters. In this issue of Molecular Ecology, Bowen et al. have used
   molecular genetic data to show that such harvests are likely to have
   deleterious effects on the health of hawksbill populations throughout

AB The Caribbean Sea and adjacent land areas are highly sensitive to the
   projected impacts of global climate change. The countries bordering the
   Caribbean Sea depend heavily on coastal and marine assets as a major
   source of livelihood support. Rising sea surface temperatures (SSTs) are
   known to be associated with coral bleaching, ocean acidification, and
   other phenomena that threaten livelihoods in the region. The paucity of
   SST systematic observations in both the Caribbean Sea and adjoining
   Western Atlantic waters is a limiting factor in the projection of future
   climate change impacts on the region's marine resources. Remote sensing
   of SST by satellites began only within the last three decades and
   although the data collected so far might be insufficient to provide
   conclusive definitions of long-term SST variations in the Caribbean
   waters, these data along with the output from climate model simulations
   provide a useful basis for gaining further insights into plausible SST
   futures under IPCC SRES scenarios. In this paper, we examine the recent
   SST records from the NESDIS AVHRR satellite data and NOAA Optimum
   Interpolation (OI) sea surface temperature V2 and provide a comparative
   analysis of projected SST changes for the Caribbean Sea up to the end of
   the twenty-first century, under the SRES A2 and B2 scenarios'
   simulations of the sea surface skin temperatures (SSsT) using the Hadley
   Centre's regional model, PRECIS. The implications of these projected SST
   changes for bleaching of coral reefs, one of the region's most valuable
   marine resource, and for rainfall are also discussed.

   assessments of food, water, and health show variation between locations,
   but with an overall tendency for the drought's effects to spread from
   lower to higher elevations as the drought progresses. This zone is in
   the hinterland of the Ok Tedi Mine, and the drought's regional impact
   was intensified by Ok Tedi's abrupt closure when low water in the Fly
   River stopped shipments of concentrate and cut off fuel and food
   supplies. The decision to close the mine was accompanied by the
   mandatory repatriation' of workers and their families to home'
   communities in the drought-stricken hinterland. This, combined with
   deteriorating regional links, has eroded the capacity of Min communities
   to weather the drought, suggesting that we must look beyond the garden
   when calculating El Nino's costs.

   on lymphoid depletion, lymphoid necrosis, splenitis, and macrophage
   accumulation. A general linear model approach was used to estimate the
   effect of isolate source (cattle versus water buffalo) on virulence.
   Isolates of water buffalo origin were significantly less virulent in the
   mouse model based on recovered B. abortus from splenic tissues,
   spleen/weight ratio, and lymphoid necrosis but not overall

AB Large islands typically have more species than comparable smaller
   islands. Ecological theories, the most influential being the equilibrium
   theory of island biogeography(1), explain the species-area relationship
   as the outcome of the effect of area on immigration and extinction
   rates. However, these theories do not apply to taxa on land masses,
   including continents and large islands, that generate most of their
   species in situ. In this case, species-area relationships should be
   driven by higher speciation rates in larger areas(2-6), a theory that
   has never been quantitatively tested. Here we show that Anolis lizards
   on Caribbean islands meet several expectations of the evolutionary
   theory. Within-island speciation exceeds immigration as a source of new
   species on all islands larger than 3,000 km(2), whereas speciation is
   rare on smaller islands. Above this threshold island size, the rate of
   species proliferation increases with island area, a process that results
   principally from the positive effects of area on speciation rate. Also
   as expected, the slope of the species-area relationship jumps sharply
   above the threshold. Although Anolis lizards have been present on large
   Caribbean islands for over 30 million years, there are indications that
   the current number of species still falls below the
   speciation-extinction equilibrium.

AB Forty South American aquatic plant species were selected and categorised
   in four a priori status classes (alien naturalised, alien invasive,
   native and absent) according to expert opinion, for 16 South American
   regions (Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Ecuador, Falklands
   Islands, French Guiana, Galapagos, Guyana, Paraguay, Peru, South Georgia
   and South Sandwich Islands, Suriname, Uruguay and Venezuela). The 40
   aquatic plant species were assessed using the US Aquatic Weed Risk
   Assessment (USAqWRA) scheme for each of the 16 South American regions,
   for a total number of 644 assessments and for South America (153
   assessments). The method was benchmarked against expert opinion
   (invasive, non-invasive). We ranked 17 of them as naturalised, and 15 as
   invasive species in at least one South American region. The USAqWRA
   distinguished between non-invaders and invaders with an overall accuracy
   of 84.9% in South America and 54.1% in the 16 regions, with areas under
   the curves equal to 0.893 and 0.853, at a threshold score of 51.5 and
   43.5, respectively. The study highlights that the USAqWRA could
   represent a suitable screening protocol to prioritise aquatic species
   that have the potential to cause negative impacts, prevent attempts of
   introduction and to manage risky aquatic plants in South America.

AB This study assessed the coral reef condition of two marine protected
   areas in the Caribbean: Guanahacabibes National Park, Cuba, and Costa
   Occidental de Isla Mujeres-Punta Cancun-Punta Nizuc National Park,
   Mexico, in a two-year period. The analyzed indicators for corals were
   live coral cover, diameter and height of the colonies, ancient and
   recent mortalities and abundance of recruits, which were evaluated in
   quadrats of 1 m(2). In addition, it was estimated the coverage by
   morphofunctional groups of macroalgae in 25 x 25 cm quadrats and the
   density of the Diadema antillarum urchin in 1 m(2) quadrats. The results
   showed differences between countries at broad spatial scales (hundreds
   of kilometers). Reefs of both MPAs seem to be in different stages of
   changes, which have been associated with deterioration of Caribbean
   reefs, toward the dominance of more resistant, non tridimensional coral
   species, causing a decrease of the reef complexity that may leads to the
   reefs to collapse. At scales of kilometers (within MPAs), a similar
   pattern was found in reefs of GNP-Cuba and different trends were
   observed in reefs of CNP-Mexico. The observed differences between
   CNP-Mexico sites appear to be associated with the current tourism use
   patterns.

AB Plankton nets moored in tidal channels around Lee Stocking Island,

   habitats on Great Bahama Bank in the winter months (December-February)
   of 1990-1991 and 1991-1992. A total of 10376 fishes were collected in
   1990-1991 from 58 taxa; in 1991-1992, 13 358 fishes were collected from
   56 taxa. Vertical distributions of 16 dominant taxa suggested that most
   settlement-stage fishes were concentrated in surface waters. Six taxa
   showed no year x depth interaction; of these, five were significantly
   more abundant in the surface nets. Eight of the ten taxa with
   significant year x depth interactions displayed a tendency to be more
   abundant in surface layers than in sub-surface collections during the
   first year, but were more evenly distributed across surface and
   sub-surface collections in the second year of sampling. Larval supply of
   six taxa showed significant coherency over spatial scales from 0.5 to
   1.5 km. Over scales up to 5 km, however, larval supply became largely
   decoupled at the daily level. Significant inter-annual variability in
   the vertical and horizontal distributions of settlement-stage fishes
   suggests that behavior may play a major role in determining larval
   supply in tropical shorefishes.

AB Rainfall variability in the eastern Caribbean during the 20th century is
   analyzed using principal component analysis and singular value
   decomposition. In contrast to earlier studies that used seasonal data,
   here we employ continuous signal processing. The leading mode is a
   decadal oscillation related to third and fourth modes of sea level
   pressure (SLP) and sea surface temperatures (SST) which together
   identify three zones of action in the Atlantic: 35 degrees N-20 degrees
   N, 20 degrees N-5 degrees N, and 5 degrees N-20 degrees S. The ability
   of the ECHAM4.5 model to simulate this signal is investigated. Its
   decadal variability is also represented through lower-order SLP and SST
   modes that comprise an Atlantic tripole pattern with lower pressure east
   of the Caribbean. Composite analysis of high and low phases of the
   decadal mode reflects a cool east Pacific and a more active Atlantic
   Intertropical Convergence Zone during boreal summer, conditions that
   favor the intensification of African easterly waves. The decadal signal
   has strengthened since 1970, yet the three centers of action in Atlantic
   SST are relatively unsynchronized.

AB The relative importance of equilibrium and nonequilibrium processes in
   shaping patterns of species richness is one of the most fundamental
   questions in biodiversity studies. If equilibrium processes predominate,
   then ecological interactions presumably limit species diversity,
   potentially through diversity dependence of immigration, speciation, and
   extinction rates. Alternatively, species richness may be limited by the
   rate at which diversity arises or by the amount of time available for
   diversification. These latter explanations constitute nonequilibrium
   processes and can apply only to biotas that are unsaturated or far from
   diversity equilibria. Recent studies have challenged whether equilibrium
   models apply to biotas assembled through in situ speciation, as this
   process may be too slow to achieve steady-state diversities. Here we
   demonstrate that speciation rates in replicate Caribbean lizard
   radiations have undergone parallel declines to equilibrium conditions on
   three of four major islands. Our results suggest that feedback between
   total island diversity and per-capita speciation rates scales inversely
   with island area, with proportionately greater declines occurring on
   smaller islands. These results are consistent with strong ecological
   controls on species richness and suggest that the iconic adaptive
   radiation of Caribbean anoles may have reached an endpoint.

AB Wave-driven flooding is a serious hazard on coral reef-fringed
   coastlines that will be exacerbated by global sea-level rise. Despite
   the global awareness of atoll island vulnerability, little is known
   about the physical processes that control wave induced flooding on reef
   environments. To resolve the primary controls on wave-driven flooding at
   present and future sea levels, we present a globally applicable method
   for calculating wave overtopping thresholds on reef coastlines. A unique
   dataset of 60,000 fully nonlinear wave transformation simulations
   representing a wide range of wave energy, morphology and sea levels
   conditions was analysed to develop a tool for exploring the future
   trajectory of atoll island vulnerability to sea-level rise. The proposed
   reef-island overtopping threshold (RIOT) provides a widely applicable
   first-order assessment of reef-coast vulnerability to wave hazards with
   sea-level. Future overtopping thresholds identified for different atoll
   islands reveal marked spatial variability and highlight distinct
   morphological characteristics that enhance coastal resilience.

AB The Palauan archipelago contains one of the most ecologically diverse
   coral reef systems in the Indo-Pacific that was as attractive for humans
   prehistorically as it is today. New evidence is emerging that during the
   past few thousand years there has been increasing exploitation of coral
   reef resources, particularly finfish and mollusks, leading to a decline
   in taxa numbers, richness, and diversity in various locales. This paper
   examines the historical interactions between human populations and coral
   reef ecologies in Palau by combining known archaeological data and
   results from modern biological data of different reef fauna. The
   integration of these data sources provides a framework for attempting to
   explain variations in taxa composition between islands in the
   archipelago and how this may relate to human exploitation or other
   phenomena through time. By using this perspective to link past events
   with present-day conditions, we can gain a better sense of the extent to
   which anthropogenic changes may have affected island environments in
   western Micronesia during the Late Holocene. The study also illustrates
   the many difficulties researchers face in attempting to synthesize and
   explain past and present human predation behavior when using disparate
   sources of data.

AB Islands of the West Indies are among the most historically impacted by
   agriculture, yet agricultural influences on forests there have been
   little studied. This research compared tree species richness and
   vegetation structure between farmed lands, post-agriculture secondary
   forests and mature remnant forests in two watersheds in Saint Lucia, and
   sought to understand the current distribution of these habitats in terms
   of land use and watershed topography. Farms devoted to annual crops had
   few trees and much exposed soil. By contrast, agroforests had abundant
   (mostly planted) trees and vegetation structure comparable to secondary
   forests. Secondary forests had highest overall species richness, but
   mature forests had the most developed vegetation structure. Variations
   in habitat distribution reflected different land use histories, with the
   more rugged west coast long dominated by tree crop farming and the east
   coast experiencing a recent boom bust cycle in bananas. Mature and
   secondary forests were more likely found at higher altitude, further
   from roads and at sites more difficult to access, the combined result of
   government protection of key forest and watershed reserves and farmers'
   preferential abandonment of marginal lands. For conservationists, this
   return of forests is reason for optimism and it presents strategic
   opportunities for public land acquisition or collaborative management to
   further forest and watershed protection objectives.

AB Environmental, biological, social, economic and political values
   influence the creation of protected areas. In some instances, the main
   aim of protected areas is to conserve a particular threatened species.
   The pig-nosed turtle (Carettochelys insculpta) in Papua New Guinea is a
   typical example of a species that would benefit from the introduction of
   small protected areas aimed to reduce overharvest. This species is
   highly prized as food and it is the most exploited turtle in the
   country. This study aims to identify priority areas for C. insculpta
   conservation in the Kikori region, taking into account the data
   available on biology, demography and harvest, as well as the
   distribution and demography of the Kikori human population. We
   identified seven potential priority areas for conservation and no-take
   areas, which comprise remote nesting sandbanks and feeding grounds. The
   conservation goals of these protected areas should be clearly linked
   with the local community aspirations of maintaining and increasing the
   number of eggs and adult turtles for future harvest. Monitoring of human
   and C. insculpta populations inside and outside priority areas are
   crucial to ensure that the vital areas for C insculpta life cycle are
   maintained and protected, since feeding and nesting areas, as well as
   hunting areas, are likely to change in response to food and sandbank
   availability. The method presented in this paper has the potential to be
   adapted and applied while defining priorities in remote locations, where
   the implementation of protected areas are likely to affect communities
   livelihoods. (C) 2015 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.

AB Twenty biallelic Y chromosome markers were analyzed in Angolares, Forros
   and Tongas, three population groups from the African archipelago of Sao
   Tome e Principe. While most male lineages belonged to sub-Saharan
   haplogroups, the component of European origin added up 23.9% in the
   archipelago. This contrasts with the reported absence of European mtDNA
   lineages, and the combined findings testify to a strong sex-biased
   admixture process during the long-lasting colonial period in Sao Tome e
   Principe. Furthermore, the male mediated European component was clearly
   found to be out of proportion to the small demographic impact of the
   Portuguese on the islands, reflecting high variance in the reproductive
   success of the individuals that contributed to its peopling.
   The male portion of European ancestry was 33.3% in Forros, 27.3% in
   Tongas and approximately two-fold less, 14.5%, in Angolares. The
   Angolares also showed the lowest haplogroup diversity and the most
   reduced number of different haplogroups. The current results reinforce
   our previous evidence pointing to remarkable restrictions in gene flow
   between Angolares and other Sao Tomean inhabitants, in agreement with
   their considerable isolation and confinement to the south-eastern tip of
   Sao Tome until recently.

AB Centrophorus specimens with a distinctive long-based first dorsal fin
   (long-finned species) have previously been considered to be Centrophorus
   lusitanicus first described from Portugal. Critical examination of the
   original description and illustration reveal that C. lusitanicus should
   be considered a junior synonym of C. granulosus. However, the specimen
   considered to be the syntype of C. lusitanicus in the Natural History
   Museum in London is clearly a long-finned species and not conspecific
   with C. granulosus. A more detailed investigation revealed that this
   specimen should not be considered a syntype and was likely not
   originally collected off the coast of Portugal. Investigation of
   long-finned specimens of Centrophorus from the Indo-West Pacific and
   Eastern Atlantic revealed that two undescribed species exist and are
   herein formally described as C. lesliei and C. longipinnis. The two
   species are similar morphologically and belong to the long-snout
   Centrophorus group (e.g. C. isodon and C. harrissoni) but are clearly
   separable based on their very long first dorsal fins. The two species
   differ in relative length of the first dorsal fin and several other
   characters. They also differ genetically. Nonmetric multidimensional
   ordination based on morphometric data reveals both species level and
   ontogenetic differences. A short erratum is also provided for Part 1 of
   this revision of the Centrophorus due to two figure related errors which
   may cause some confusion.

AB Energetic responses of zooxanthellate reef corals along depth gradients
   have relevance to the refugia potential of mesophotic coral ecosystems
   (MCEs). Previous observations suggested that MCEs in the Caribbean are
   thermally buffered during the warmest parts of the year and occur within
   or just below the chlorophyll maximum, suggesting abundant trophic
   resources. However, it is not known if mesophotic corals can maintain
   constant energy needs throughout the year with changing environmental
   and biological conditions. The energetic content of tissues from the
   stony coral species Orbicella faveolata and Agaricia lamarcki was
   measured on the southern insular shelf of St. Thomas, US Virgin Islands
   (USVI), using micro-bomb calorimetry. Three sites for each species, at
   depths of 6m, 25m, 38m and 63m, were selected to capture energetic
   differences across the major vertical range extent of both species in
   the USVI-and sampled over five periods from April 2013 to April 2014.
   Mesophotic colonies of O. faveolata exhibited a significant reduction in
   energetic content during the month of September 2013 compared to
   mid-depth and shallow colonies (p = 0.032), whereas A. lamarcki
   experienced similar energetic variability, but with a significant
   reduction in energy content that occurred in July 2013 for colonies at
   sites deeper than 25m (p = 0.014). The results of calorimetric analyses
   indicate that O. faveolata may be at risk during late summer stress
   events, possibly due to the timing of reproductive activities. The
   low-point of A. lamarcki energy content, which may also coincide with
   reproduction, occurs prior to seasonal stress events, indicating
   contrasting, species-specific responses to environmental variability on
   MCEs.

AB This study examines the biogeography of the ant fauna of Timor and of
   stepping stone Nusa Tenggara islands to the north (Wetar, Atauro, Alor,
   Pantar and Lembata) that are geographically closer to continental South
   East Asia. Timor is of outstanding biogeographical significance because
   it is the second largest island within the Wallacean transitional zone
   between the closely approximated but geologically distinct
   Indo-Australasian and South East Asian continental plates. It represents
   a potential overlap zone between the otherwise disjunct ant faunas of
   Australia and South East Asia. A total of 154 ant species from 32 genera
   and six subfamilies were collected through a combination of systematic
   sampling in evergreen forest, dry forest, savanna and grassland at 23
   locations in the Lautem district of Timor-Leste, and opportunistic
   collections at 29 sites elsewhere on Timor and on the neighbouring
   islands. The most species-rich genera were Camponotus and Polyrhachis
   (both 28 species), Tetramorium (14 species), Diacamma and Paratrechina
   (both 8 species). On Timor, 111 ant species were recorded, including 64
   species in the Lautem district. The Timor ant fauna is dominated by taxa
   of South East Asian origin (76% of native species), and has only weak
   Australian affinities (18%). The latter figure is even smaller (14%) for
   the neighbouring islands, reflecting their closer proximity to South
   East Asia. In contrast to Australia, there was no clear disjunction
   between the ant faunas of contrasting tropical forest and savanna
   habitats sampled in Lautem district. This can be explained by the Timor
   ant fauna being dominated by South East Asian tropical forest taxa, with
   Australian savanna woodland taxa being poorly represented.

AB Thiamine pyrophosphate (TPP) is the major biologically active form of
   thiamine (vitamin B1). This cross-sectional study assessed whole-blood
   thiamine pyrophosphate concentration (WBTPPC) in boarding school
   students in the Southern Region of Papua New Guinea. Sample size for
   each of the five boarding schools was calculated using the
   'proportionate to population size' cluster sampling technique. The
   'Clin-Rep' reagent kit was used for the extraction of thiamine
   pyrophosphate from whole blood. Reverse phase high performance liquid
   chromatography with post-column derivatization was used to determine the
   thiamine pyrophosphate concentration. Informed consent was obtained from
   468 students, mean age 17.7 +/- 1.5 years. The gender distribution of
   these students was 274 (58.5%) males and 194 (41.5%) females. The median
   and interquartile range of WBTPPC for all students was 95.41 microg/l
   (82.27-113.55). Severe to marginal status of thiamine deficiency was
   present in 6.4% of all the students. The mean WBTPPC for female students
   was significantly lower than that for the male students (p < 0.001),
   with a mean difference of 14.17 microg/l (95% CI of the difference:
   9.85-18.50). Severe to marginal status of thiamine deficiency was
   present in 9.8% of female students and 4.0% of male students. The data
   strongly support the need for effective implementation and monitoring of
   food fortification legislation in Papua New Guinea. Withdrawal of
   fortification or suboptimal thiamine fortification of rice and other
   cereal products in Papua New Guinea would have serious negative public
   health implications, especially among students in boarding schools.

AB In northern Australia and nearby Timor-Leste, saltwater crocodile
   (Crocodylus porosus) populations were seriously depleted historically
   but recovered rapidly after protection: 1969-1974 in northern Australia,
   and 2000-2005 in Timor-Leste. In both places, recovery caused increased
   rates of human-crocodile conflict (HCC). Within northern Australia, the
   crocodile recovery and HCC have been documented over time. In contrast,
   this has not been the situation in Timor-Leste, where we investigated
   HCC based on 130 attack records (1996-2014; 52% fatal). In 1996-2006,
   0.55 attacks/year were reported in Timor-Leste. By 2007-2014, 9 years
   later, a 23-fold increase had occurred (13 attacks/year). Traditional
   subsistence fishing (82.5% of all attack records) is the highest risk
   activity, followed by bathing (7.5%) and water collecting (4.2%).
   Although the human population was correlated with crocodile attacks in
   Timor-Leste, it likely does not explain the dramatic increase in
   crocodile attacks. Alternatively, crocodile numbers may have increased,
   either in the remnant resident crocodile population, or via migrants
   from elsewhere. Permanent crocodile habitat is limited, and limited
   breeding does not explain the high number of large crocodiles, and
   consequent increase in attacks in such a short time. A plausible
   explanation, consistent with traditional knowledge in Timor-Leste, is
   that the influx of large crocodiles attacking people are migrants from
   Australia. We examined this possibility from available sources. Within
   Australia crocodiles have recovered since protection and they regularly
   invade adjacent habitats, such as Darwin harbor, where they are removed
   to prevent attacks on people. Saltwater crocodiles have been sighted at
   oil rigs, in the open ocean, moving between northern Australia and the
   south coast of Timor-Leste. The likelihood of crocodiles migrating from
   Australia to Timor-Leste raises obvious conservation, moral, and ethical
   dilemmas when conserving a large dangerous predator in one country to
   increase abundance results in dispersal to another country, where the
   predator attacks and kills people. (c) 2018 The Wildlife Society.
   We recorded 130 crocodile attacks between 1996 and 2014 in the Southeast
   Asian nation of Timor-Leste, located approximately 450km north of
   Australia. Our results indicated that an increase in the numbers of
   large saltwater crocodiles is the primary factor driving the
   accelerating human-crocodile conflict in the country and that dispersing
   crocodiles from Australia may add to the rapid recovery of the Timorese
   saltwater crocodile population after protection (2000-2005).

AB The Sahara and Sahel regions of Africa are important sources of dust
   particles into the atmosphere. Dust particles from these regions are
   transported over the Atlantic Ocean to the Eastern American Coasts. This
   transportation shows temporal and spatial variability and often reaches
   its peak during the boreal summer (June-July-August). The regional
   climate model (RegCM 4.0), containing a module of dust emission,
   transport, and deposition processes, is used in this study. Saharan and
   Sahelian dusts emissions, transports, and climatic impact on
   precipitations during the spring (March-April-May) and summer
   (June-July-August) were studied using this model. The results showed
   that the simulation were coherent with observations made by the MISR
   satellite and the AERONET ground stations, within the domain of Africa
   (Banizoumba, Cinzana, and M'Bour) and Ragged-point (Barbados Islands).
   The transport of dust particles was predominantly from North-East to
   South-West over the studied period (2005-2010). The seasonality of dust
   plumes' trajectories was influenced by the altitudes reached by dusts in
   the troposphere. The impact of dusts on climate consisted of a cooling
   effect both during the boreal summer and spring over West Africa (
   except Southern-Guinea and Northern-Liberia), Central Africa,
   South-America, and Caribbean where increased precipitations were
   observed.

AB Local knowledge has played an active role in the lives of rural
   communities in virtually every part of the world. In Jamaica,
   traditional cropping systems based on local informal knowledge have been
   practiced since the days of slavery and play a vital role in meeting
   food security. Yet, some negative attitudes remain about the legitimacy
   and relevance of small-scale farmers' local and traditional knowledge.
   This paper discusses some conceptual and empirical issues related to the
   application of local knowledge among small-scale food farmers in central
   Jamaica. The paper argues that contextually speaking, local and
   traditional knowledge is valuable, adaptable and necessary in coping
   with risk and uncertainty in a changing world, while cautioning against
   a misguided notion of traditional knowledge as a panacea to all the ills
   of local agriculture.

AB The current worldwide degradation of coral reefs constitutes an
   international problem that calls for immediate attention. A multitude of
   conservation hotspots scattered over the circumtropical seas have been
   identified, but there has been no general agreement as to how to attack
   the problem. The major difficulty seems to be the lack of a priority
   system. Are some reefs more important than others? If so, where are they
   located and what needs to be done? Some reefs are located in areas where
   the biodiversity (species, genera, families) is exceptionally high and
   where there is evidence of past and present evolutionary production.
   These areas are called centres of origin and one. is located in the
   Indo-Pacific Ocean and the other in the Atlantic. The Indo-Pacific
   centre, located in the East Indies Triangle, is considered to be the
   primary tropical center due to its broad geographic influence. The
   Atlantic centre, located in the southern Caribbean Sea, is considered a
   secondary centre because its influence is restricted to the tropical
   Atlantic. These centres, although occupying relatively small geographic
   areas, are evidently the source of dominant species that have played the
   major role in assembling coral reef communities across each ocean. The
   existence of the two centres permits one to realize that, in the coral
   reef environment, there is, a geographical separation between process
   and pattern. Recognition of the separation will allow significant
   improvements in conservation planning. The evolutionary process in the
   centres must be protected in order to maintain the outlying diversity
   patterns. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

   homogeneous morphology and this is supposed to be a result of a limited
   habitat preference shown in this genus. Nearly all species only occur on
   rocky intertidal shores, except for F. rotunda dwelling in mangrove
   habitats and F. smiti found in riverine environments. Fortuynia smiti
   was now also found in a typical littoral habitat in Singapore and hence
   the remarkably broad ecological range of this species is discussed. The
   records of further fortuyniid species in the Indo-Pacific affirm that
   this taxon may be continuously distributed along shores of this
   geographic region.

   categories based on the IUCN guidelines from 2001, and E category
   established according to the IUCN guidelines from 1980) is presented. A
   database of over 1,300 endemic species that are either Critically
   Endangered or Endangered sensu IUCN was created. There are molecular
   systematic studies available for 112 of them. Six of these species (in
   six genera) are the only members of early divergent lineages that are
   sister to groups composed of a large number of clades. Seven of the
   species (in seven genera) belong to clades that have a small number of
   taxa but are sister to species/genus-rich clades. Ten of the species (in
   six genera) are sister to taxa restricted to South America or nested in
   clades endemic to this region. Fifty-seven of the species (in 35 genera)
   are sister to Caribbean Island endemic species. Erigeron belliastroides,
   an Endangered (EN) Cuban endemic, is sister to the Galapagos genus
   Darwiniothamnus. The phylogenetic placement of four of the threatened
   species resulted in changes in their taxonomic placement; they belong to
   polyphyletic or paraphyletic genera.

AB The colonial stony coral genus Madracis is cosmopolitan, lives in
   shallow and deep water habitats, and includes zooxanthellate,
   azooxanthellate and facultative symbiotic species. One of its species,
   Madracis pharensis, has been recorded from the Mediterranean and East
   Atlantic, where it forms small knobby and facultative zooxanthellate
   colonies (also named M. pharensis f. pharensis), and from the tropical
   Caribbean, where it also occurs in a massive and zooxanthellate form
   (named M. pharensis f. luciphila by some). These two forms have been
   previously found to host different Symbiodinium species. In this study,
   species boundaries and phylogenetic relationships between these two
   Madracis pharensis forms (from the Mediterranean Sea and the Caribbean),
   M. senaria, and the Indo-west Pacific M. kirbyi were analyzed through an
   integrated systematics approach, including corallite dimensions,
   micromorphology and two molecular markers (ITS and ATP8). Significant
   genetic and morphological differences were found between all the
   examined Madracis species, and between M. pharensis from the
   Mediterranean Sea and M. pharensis f. luciphila from the Caribbean in
   particular. Based on these results, the latter does not represent a
   zooxanthellate ecomorph of the former but a different species. Its
   identity remains to be ascertained and its relationship with the
   Caribbean M. decactis, with which it bears morphologic resemblance, must
   be investigated in further studies. Overall, the presence of cryptic
   Madracis species in the Easter and Central Atlantic Ocean remains to be
   evaluated.

   studies evaluated the types of messages that adolescents received in
   relation to body image, physical activity and eating. The participants
   were male and female adolescents from Fiji (two cultural groups), Tonga,
   New Zealand (Tongans) and Australia (European Australians). Three
   studies were conducted: interviews with 48 adolescents (24 male, 24
   female) from each cultural group, questionnaires with 600 adolescents
   (300 male, 300 female) from each cultural group and the perceptual
   distortion study with 100 adolescents (50 male, 50 female) from the two
   cultural groups in Fiji and European Australians. The results
   demonstrate that parents, peers, the media, as well as religious
   influences impact on the type of body valued by adolescents in each of
   the cultural groups, as well as their levels of body satisfaction. These
   influences also shape the type and volume of food consumed, and the type
   and frequency of physical activity. The results of these studies
   highlight the major role played by the broader societal values in
   shaping the nature of the messages that adolescents receive in relation
   to their body size, eating and physical activity.

AB In recent years, marine scientists have become increasingly alarmed over
   the decline of live coral cover throughout the Caribbean and tropical
   western Atlantic region. The Holocene and Pleistocene fossil record of
   coral reefs from this region potentially provides a wealth of long-term
   ecologic information with which to assess the historical record of
   changes in shallow water coral reef communities. Before fossil data can
   be applied to the modern reef system, critical problems involving fossil
   preservation must be addressed. Moreover, it must be demonstrated that
   the classic reef coral zonation patterns described in the early days of
   coral reef ecology, and upon which "healthy" versus "unhealthy" reefs
   are determined, are themselves representative of reefs that existed
   prior to any human influence. To address these issues, we have conducted
   systematic censuses of life and death assemblages on modern "healthy"
   patch reefs in the Florida reef tract that conform to the classic
   Caribbean model of reef coral zonation, and a patch reef in the Bahamas
   that is currently undergoing a transition in coral dominance that is
   part of a greater Caribbean-wide phenomenon. Results were compared to
   censuses of ancient reef assemblages preserved in Pleistocene limestones
   in close proximity to each modern reef. We have determined that the
   Pleistocene fossil record of coral reefs may be used to calibrate an
   ecological baseline with which to compare modern reef assemblages, and
   suggest that the current and rapid decline of Acropora cervicornis
   observed on a Bahamian patch reef may be a unique event that contrasts
   with the long-term persistence of this taxon during Pleistocene and
   Holocene time.

AB Queen conch is an important marine resource in the Bahamas, however
   stocks around some of the islands are being threatened. In south
   Eleuthera, a downturn in the local economy during recent decades has
   caused fishing pressure to increase, and local stocks are showing signs
   of stress. In response, a fully-protected marine reserve is proposed for
   the waters near Cape Eleuthera in an attempt to rebuild local conch
   populations and other commercially valuable fish stocks. Analysis of
   shell midden data from Cape Eleuthera revealed that over 30% of the
   conch were juveniles. Additionally, visual shoreline surveys of conch
   shells and anecdotal observations of fishing patterns suggest that
   juvenile conch are actively being harvested from nursery grounds.
   Nevertheless, preliminary results from visual surveys conducted in and
   around a frequently fished nursery ground indicate that the density of
   juveniles is relatively high ([approximately]970 conch/ha). This
   suggests that larval supply to the area is currently sufficient to
   maintain densities of small juveniles, although current fishing
   practices likely curtail the dispersal of juveniles to adult habitat,
   affecting the breeding stock. Further visual surveys of conch in this
   area will increase understanding of local population dynamics and
   improve the ability to assess the effectiveness of the proposed reserve.

AB We report two vertical profiles of the concentration and isotopic

   degrees S and 30 degrees S along a longitude of 170 degrees W in the

   values are less radiogenic than those obtained from the subtropical
   North Pacific. The minimum epsilon(Nd) values of -8.0 and -6.9 at depths
   of 800 to 1000 m correspond to Antarctic Intermediate Water (AAIW). The
   differences in eNd values between upper deep water (2000-3000 m) and
   lower deep water (>4000 m) seem to be associated with Upper and Lower
   Circumpolar Deep Waters (UCDW and LCDW, respectively). The radiogenic Nd
   supply to AAIW from the Society Islands is estimated to be 30 +/- 22
   tons Nd/yr, which is consistent with the estimates from previous studies
   conducted in the same location and the oceanic region close to the

AB National and transboundary adverse effects of competition for land are
   being increasingly recognized by researchers and decision-makers,
   however the consideration of these impacts within national planning
   strategies is not yet commonplace. To estimate how increasing
   agricultural production can be conciliated with protection of natural
   resources at the national scale, we analyzed current land use in
   Suriname, and investigated opportunities for, and constraints to
   developing a sustainable agricultural sector.
   Suriname is a remarkable case study. To date, Suriname has retained most
   of its natural resources with forest areas covering over 90% of the
   country. Surinamese forests combine extremely high levels of both
   biodiversity and carbon, making them top priority from a global
   ecosystem services perspective. Among other national and international
   pressures from increased demand for agricultural products, the country
   is also considering significant expansion of agricultural output to both
   diminish imports and become a 'bread basket' for the Caribbean region,
   which collectively may pose risks to natural resources.
   In this study, combining locally-obtained primary data, expert
   consultation and secondary data from the Food and Agriculture
   Organization we analyzed a range of scenarios, we show the complexities
   associated with current land management and we discuss alternatives for
   developing a sustainable agricultural sector in Suriname. We show that
   Suriname can increase the production of rice, which is the most
   important agricultural activity in the country, without expanding rice
   area. Rather, future increase in rice production could be promoted
   through an increase in rice productivity, and the employment of more
   environmentally-favorable management methods, in order to both diminish
   pollution and avoid encroachment of the agriculture into pristine areas.
   Further, we show a potential to both contribute to greening of the
   agricultural sector and to higher economic returns through expanding the
   production of 'safe food' and through possible development of organic
   agriculture in Suriname.
   If Suriname develops a 'greener' agricultural sector, it may both
   increase economic returns from the agricultural sector and benefit from
   continuing protection of natural resources. Because most of Suriname
   forests present top levels of carbon and biodiversity, the country could
   benefit from so-called 'early-action' Reducing Emissions from
   Deforestation and Forest Degradation (REDD) finance, which is already
   being paid mostly through bilateral agreements. Further, by adopting
   land-use planning that protects natural resources, Suriname may be in
   extraordinary position to benefit from both improved-quality
   agricultural production and from incentives to conserve forest carbon
   and biodiversity, such as payments for ecosystem services. Given the
   high stakes and the severe lack of both primary data and applied
   analyses in Suriname, further research focused on better informing
   land-use policies would be a valuable investment for the country.
   Although this analysis was performed for Suriname, conclusions drawn
   here are transferrable and may assist formulation of policy
   recommendations for land use elsewhere. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All

   a remarkable difference from those collected at the 12 other localities,
   and those from Tahiti showed a significant difference from those

   Furthermore, significant differences were found between the North

   regions and Reunion island, while there were few differences between
   specimens from the Indian and South Pacific Ocean regions. It appears
   likely, based on this morphological analysis and the geographic range of

AB The Tenkile Conservation Alliance (TCA) was established in 2001, with
   the initial motivation to safeguard the future of the critically
   endangered Papua New Guinea (PNG) endemic tree kangaroo, the tenkile. It
   rapidly became obvious that the status of a second critically endangered
   tree kangaroo species, the weimang, was equally parlous, and the TCA
   subsequently focused its work on both species. As a collateral element
   of its research and conservation programs, the TCA has also recorded
   information on the broad scale biodiversity of the Torricelli Mountain
   Range. While most such data were collected opportunistically over the
   period 2003-10, in 2011-12 six camera traps were deployed in a pilot
   study with the specific aim of building on the rudimentary baseline
   knowledge of the vertebrate fauna of the Torricelli Mountain Range.
   Nineteen species of birds and 11 mammals were identifiable from camera
   images, but many, including 134 images of rodents, could not be
   identified to species because of blurred or partial images. The results
   of the pilot camera trapping survey indicate that camera trapping for
   faunal biodiversity assessment of the region will need to proceed over
   the next 3-5 years. I also comment on the use of camera trap imagery to
   engage villagers in the monitoring and conservation of tenkile and other
   endemic fauna.

AB Atmospheric dust concentrations have been measured continuously since
   1965 at Barbados providing one of the longest records of modern
   atmospheric dust downwind the dust transport route from North Africa
   toward the Caribbean. The Barbados dust concentration (BDC) record shows
   a high variability on daily to decadal timescales. This study aims to
   assess the importance of four processes that have the potential to
   contribute to the observed day-to-day variability: (1) changes in the
   transport pathways, (2) changes in atmospheric transport time, (3)
   changes in the atmospheric dust loadings in the source regions in North
   Africa, and (4) changes in rainfall. Back-trajectories are calculated
   for low and high dust days in June (peak month in annual cycle) and
   analyzed with respect to these four processes. The results show that
   statistically significant differences exist between low and high BDC
   days for all four processes. For high BDC days we observe (1) an
   increase in the number of trajectories (especially at 100 and 150 hPa
   above the surface) which originated over the North African continent due
   to differences in the transport pathways, (2) a faster trans-Atlantic
   transport at the height of the SAL by up to 0.87 days which would mean
   less dust being removed as a result of dry deposition and less
   diffusion, (3) increased dust loadings over West Africa and the tropical
   North Atlantic, and (4) less rainfall in ITCZ region which may have a
   minor impact of dust loadings due to wet deposition. Our results support
   the findings of previous studies that changes in dust emission and
   rainfall impact dust variability over the Atlantic Ocean and the
   Caribbean. In addition to these two processes, our findings suggest that
   also changes in the synoptic meteorology over the North Atlantic and
   varying transport speed can affect BDC variability by modulating dust
   transport pattern.

AB Previously, host-parasitoid links have been unveiled almost exclusively
   by time-intensive rearing, while molecular methods were used only in
   simple agricultural host-parasitoid systems in the form of
   species-specific primers. Here, we present a general method for the
   molecular detection of these links applied to a complex
   caterpillar-parasitoid food web from tropical rainforest of Papua New
   Guinea. We DNA barcoded hosts, parasitoids and their tissue remnants and
   matched the sequences to our extensive library of local species. We were
   thus able to match 87% of host sequences and 36% of parasitoid sequences
   to species and infer subfamily or family in almost all cases. Our
   analysis affirmed 93 hitherto unknown trophic links between 37 host
   species from a wide range of Lepidoptera families and 46 parasitoid
   species from Hymenoptera and Diptera by identifying DNA sequences for
   both the host and the parasitoid involved in the interaction. Molecular
   detection proved especially useful in cases where distinguishing host
   species in caterpillar stage was difficult morphologically, or when the
   caterpillar died during rearing. We have even detected a case of extreme
   parasitoid specialization in a pair of Choreutis species that do not
   differ in caterpillar morphology and ecology. Using the molecular
   approach outlined here leads to better understanding of parasitoid host
   specificity, opens new possibilities for rapid surveys of food web
   structure and allows inference of species associations not already
   anticipated.

AB A mammal survey was carried out between 1984 and 1987 in southern West
   Sepik Province, Papua New Guinea. Eleven major collecting localities, as
   well as some more minor ones, lying at altitudes of between 120 and
   3,200 m were investigated. Voucher specimens for 87 indigenous mammal
   taxa were obtained, but research suggests that mammal diversity in the
   area may be as high as 120 species. This is the highest mammal diversity
   recorded anywhere in Australasia. A similar high bird diversity suggests
   that the area may be one of exceptionally high biodiversity overall. The
   most diverse mammal assemblages in the study area are found in the
   midmontane oak forests (between 1,500 and 2,500 m). Seven species, which
   apparently have no ecological vicars elsewhere in PNG, inhabit these
   forests. Changing patterns of human exploitation endanger some species.
   Recommendations aimed at halting this decline are made. The effect of
   the introduction of cats in one area was assessed as cats were
   introduced  in the middle of the survey period.

PY 2006
AB In the period 1986-2004, 238 common bottlenose dolphins Tursiops
   truncatus were exported from Cuba, as shown by UNEP/WCMC data, more than
   60% of these to facilities in Latin America and the Caribbean, some 32%
   to Europe and the rest to Canada and Israel. There is a very significant
   increase in exported numbers, reaching 28 individuals per annum in 2002.
   It is unclear how many T. truncatus have been used in domestic
   dolphinaria. A review of available information did not identify evidence
   to corroborate hypotheses that: (i) T. truncatus off Sabana-Camaguey
   Archipelago (where removals occur) does not show population structure;
   and (ii) virtually no bycatches occur in Cuban waters. Here it is argued
   that, considering Cuba's fully developed marine fisheries, some level of
   mortality from bycatch is inevitable. Other potential threats are also
   identified. Global phylogenetics research of T. truncatus is revealing
   unexpected and more complex, stock structures, in inshore (coastal)
   forms within relatively small areas. In Cuba, low mean group sizes (less
   than 10) suggest that one or more coastal stock(s) are exploited. Sex
   distribution of measured specimens suggest a significant bias towards
   extraction of females. It is concluded that sustainability of harvest
   levels of Cuban T. truncatus cannot be evaluated until abundance
   estimates become available and population structure is verified by
   molecular genetic methods. Perez-Cao (2004) indicated that available
   density estimates should not be used to determine [safe] catch quotas.
   The authors strongly recommend that international trade of T. truncatus
   from Cuba ceases until no-detriment can be authenticated and that more
   research be developed. Similar arguments may be applicable to other
   unassessed but exploited populations in the Wider Caribbean.

AB Modest earthquakes may trigger large submarine landslides, responsible
   for disastrous tsunami waves, as demonstrated by the Papua New Guinea
   event of July 17, 1998. The relatively small earthquake was followed by
   unexpectedly high waves, up to 15 m wiping out 3 villages and killing
   more than 2200 people. Numerical simulations show that seismic
   dislocation sources are not energetic enough to reproduce the observed
   tsunami along the coast. Tsunami generation by a submarine landslide has
   been simulated by a finite-difference model, assimilating the landslide
   to a flow of granular material. Long-wave approximation is adopted for
   both water waves and the slide. Numerical results show that observed
   inundation heights are well reproduced for a volume of 4 km(3) located
   20 km offshore, sliding downslope with a Coulomb-type friction.

AB Citizen science has been gaining momentum in the United States and
   Europe, where citizens are literate and often interested in science.
   However, in developing countries, which have a dire need for
   environmental data, such programs are slow to emerge, despite the large
   and untapped human resources in close proximity to areas of high
   biodiversity and poorly known floras and faunas. Thus, we propose that
   the parataxonomist and paraecologist approach, which originates from
   citizen-based science, is well suited to rural areas in developing
   countries. Being a paraecologist or a parataxonomist is a vocation and
   entails full-time employment underpinned by extensive training, whereas
   citizen science involves the temporary engagement of volunteers. Both
   approaches have their merits depending on the context and objectives of
   the research. We examined 4 ongoing paraecologist or parataxonomist
   programs in Costa Rica, India, Papua New Guinea, and southern Africa and
   compared their origins, long-term objectives, implementation strategies,
   activities, key challenges, achievements, and implications for resident
   communities. The programs supported ongoing research on biodiversity
   assessment, monitoring, and management, and participants engaged in
   non-academic capacity development in these fields. The programs in
   Southern Africa related to specific projects, whereas the programs in
   Costa Rica, India, and Papua New Guinea were designed for the long term,
   provided sufficient funding was available. The main focus of the
   paraecologists' and parataxonomists' activities ranged from collection
   and processing of specimens (Costa Rica and Papua New Guinea) or of
   socioeconomic and natural science data (India and Southern Africa) to
   communication between scientists and residents (India and Southern
   Africa). As members of both the local land user and research
   communities, paraecologists and parataxonomists can greatly improve the
   flow of biodiversity information to all users, from local stakeholders
   to international academia.

AB A Porites sp. coral growing offshore from the Sepik and Ramu Rivers in
   equatorial northern Papua New Guinea has yielded an accurate 20-year
   history (1977-1996) of sea surface temperature (SST), river discharge,
   and wind-induced mixing of the upper water column. Depressions in
   average SSTs of about 0.5-1.0degreesC (indicated by coral Sr/Ca) and
   markedly diminished freshwater runoff to the coastal ocean (indicated by
   coral delta(18)O, delta(13)C and UV fluorescence) are evident during the
   El Ni (n) over tildeo - Southern Oscillation (ENSO) events of 1982-1983,
   1987 and 1991-1993. The perturbations recorded by the coral are in good
   agreement with changes in instrumental SST and river
   discharge/precipitation records, which are known to be diagnostic of the
   response of the Pacific Warm Pool ocean-atmosphere system to El Ni (n)
   over tildeo. Consideration of coastal ocean dynamics indicates that the
   establishment of northwest monsoon winds promotes mixing of near-surface
   waters to greater depths in the first quarter of most years, making the
   coral record sensitive to changes in the Asian-Australian monsoon cycle.
   Sudden cooling of SSTs by similar to1degreesC following westerly wind
   episodes, as indicated by the coral Sr/Ca, is consistent with greater
   mixing in the upper water column at these times. Furthermore, the coral
   UV fluorescence and oxygen isotope data indicate minimal contribution of
   river runoff to surface ocean waters at the beginning of most years,
   during the time of maximum discharge. This abrupt shift in flood-plume
   behaviour appears to reflect the duration and magnitude of northwest
   monsoon winds, which tend to disperse flood plume waters to a greater
   extent in the water column when wind-mixing is enhanced. Our results
   suggest that a multi-proxy geochemical approach to the production of
   long coral records should provide comprehensive reconstructions of
   tropical paleoclimate processes operating on interannual timescales. (C)

AB During summer, large amounts of mineral dust are emitted and transported
   from North Africa over the tropical North Atlantic towards the Caribbean
   with the exact quantity varying greatly from year to year. Much effort
   has been made to explain the variability of summer season mineral dust
   load, for example, by relating dust variability to teleconnection
   indices such as ENSO and the NAO. However, only weak relationships
   between such climate indices and the abundance of mineral dust have been
   found. In this work, we demonstrate the role of the near-surface
   convergence zone over West Africa in controlling dust load and transport
   of mineral dust. We apply the 'Center of Action' approach to obtain
   indices that quantify the movement and strength of the convergence zone
   using NCEP/NCAR Reanalysis data. The latitudinal position of the
   convergence zone is significantly correlated with the quantity of
   mineral dust at Barbados over the period 1965-2003 (r = -0.47). A
   southward displacement of the convergence zone is associated with both
   increased near-surface flow and decreased precipitation over the dust
   source regions of the southern Saharan desert, Sahel and Lake Chad. This
   in turn reduces soil moisture and vegetation, furthering the potential
   for dust emission. In contrast, the intensity of the convergence zone is
   not correlated with dust concentration at Barbados. We conclude that the
   coupling of changes in near-surface winds with changes in precipitation
   in source regions driven by a southward movement of the convergence zone
   most directly influence dust load at Barbados and over the tropical
   North Atlantic during summer.

AB Avian malaria is caused by a diverse community of genetically
   differentiated parasites of the genera Plasmodium and Haemoproteus.
   Rapid seasonal and annual antigenic allele turnover resulting from
   selection by host immune systems, as observed in some parasite
   populations infecting humans, may extend analogously to dynamic species
   compositions within communities of avian malarial parasites. To address
   this issue, we examined the stability of avian malarial parasite
   lineages across multiple time-scales within two insular host
   communities. Parasite communities in Puerto Rico and St Lucia included
   20 and 14 genetically distinct parasite lineages, respectively. Lineage
   composition of the parasite community in Puerto Rico did not vary
   seasonally or over a 1 year interval. However, over intervals
   approaching a decade, the avian communities of both islands experienced
   an apparent loss or gain of one malarial parasite lineage, indicating
   the potential for relatively frequent lineage turnover. Patterns of
   temporal variation of parasite lineages in this study suggest periodic
   colonization and extinction events driven by a combination of
   host-specific immune responses, competition between lineages and drift.
   However, the occasional and ecologically dynamic lineage turnover
   exhibited by insular avian parasite communities is not as rapid as
   antigenic allele turnover within populations of human malaria.

AB While the combined forest cover of Small Island Developing States (SIDS)
   is insignificant in global terms, forests and trees on these islands are
   extremely important for the wellbeing of the inhabitants. For most of
   the larger islands, forests also contribute significantly to the
   national economy and to international trade in wood and non-wood forest
   products. In addition, forest resources on several islands are of global
   importance in terms of their role in the conservation of biological
   diversity, in particular endemic species and genetic variability. As a
   group, SIDS are well endowed with forests but the extent of forest cover
   varies greatly among island states. Despite variations in size,
   location, population density and climatic, geological and topographic
   conditions, these states share many characteristics which impose
   particular constraints, but also some which offer unique opportunities,
   for the sustainable management of their forests and trees.

AB The mesopelagic calanoid copepod Gaussia princeps ( Scott, 1894) was
   originally described from the eastern Atlantic. It has been recorded in
   tropical and subtropical latitudes of the world, but has been reported
   only occasionally from the northwestern tropical Atlantic ( NWTA).
   Comparative morphological studies, particularly of males, have not
   included specimens from the NWTA. Based on a collection of zooplankton
   from the Caribbean Sea, an adult male of G. princeps is illustrated in
   detail and its morphology compared with other sources in order to
   explore intra- and interoceanic differences within the species. The
   proportions and structure of the Caribbean specimens agree with the
   description of specimens from the eastern Atlantic and the Indian Ocean,
   except in details of the ornamentation of some appendages. Additional
   intra- and interspecific differences were found in the number of
   integumental pores on the male antennules, swimming legs 1 - 4, and
   fifth legs. Integumental pores are consistently fewer in the Caribbean
   male than in the IndoPacific and eastern Atlantic counterparts, but G.
   princeps remains as the species of the genus with the largest number of
   pores on the swimming legs, a potential species- defining character
   within the genus. The Caribbean record, at 25 - 50 m deep, is the
   shallowest occurrence known for this mesopelagic form in the NWTA and
   represents the first finding of the genus and species in the western
   Caribbean and in Mexican waters.

AB The coral genus Acropora is reviewed from Indonesia for the first time,
   following detailed collections made at 131 sites and additional material
   collected from approximately 40 sites throughout the archipelago during
   the period 1993-6. Eight-thr ee species are recorded, four of these
   (Acropora halmaherae, A. awi, A. plumosa and A. simplex) new to science,
   sis first described in 1994 and sh in 1997. Records are compared with
   specimen-based records from localities worldwide. The species of
   Acropora occurring in Indonesian waters include five recorded only from
   the Indian Ocean and Indonesia, seven recorded only from the Pacific
   Ocean, South China Sea and Indonesia, and a further 10 species
   apparently endemic to Indonesia, as well as widespread Indo-Pacific
   species. Two species (A. jacquelinae Wallace, 1994 and A. batunai
   Wallace, 1996) are recorded only from north central Indonesia and Papua
   New Guinea, and two species (A. russeili Wallace, 1994 and A. turaki
   Wallace, 1994) only from north central Indonesia and north western
   Australia. The findings contribute to a new view of the corals of the
   Indo-Pacific 'centre of diversity' as a composite fauna with origins in
   a number of events in space and time. (C) 1998 The Linnean Society of

AB This study presents the description of two Callyspongia species new to
   science, and the distribution of all Callyspongia species recorded
   during the first joint Cuba-U.S. expedition to characterize Cuban
   mesophotic coral ecosystems (May-June 2017). Additionally, we propose a
   key to identify thin branching species of the genus in the Greater
   Caribbean. The observations here presented are the result of underwater
   explorations with the Mohawk Remotely Operated Vehicle dives at 35 sites
   around the island, at depths of 25-188 m, recording images and videos,
   and collecting specimens. The depth range of five species of
   Callyspongia, reported before in Cuba, has been extended to deeper
   waters. Two specimens of branching Callyspongia were collected and
   described: Callyspongia (Callyspongia) pedroi sp. nov. and Callyspongia
   (Cladochalina) alcola doi sp. nov. Morphometric comparisons of external
   and skeletal traits show clear differences with the other Callyspongia
   species from the Central West Atlantic with a similar thin branching
   habit. Callyspongia (C.) pedroi sp. nov. consists of pinkish delicate
   cylindrical microconulose branches (3-6 mm in diameter, 10-14 cm long)
   that rarely anastomose, with relatively large oval oscules (1-3 mm in
   diameter), and a skeleton dominated by primary and secondary fiber
   reticulations, discretely cored by fusiform oxeas. Callyspongia (C.)
   alcola doi sp. nov. consists of grayish, smooth thin branches (3-8 mm in
   diameter, 20-30 cm long), profusely dividing and occasionally
   anastomosing, with few spiny projections (2-4 mm wide, 2-4 cm long). Its
   skeleton includes a highly developed ectosomal tertiary reticulation
   within the secondary and primary reticulation, and fibers discretely
   cored by predominant mucronate oxeas. Clear morphometric differences of
   spicules and their skeletal reticulation distinguish these species from
   the other six thinly branching Callyspongia species known from the
   Caribbean.

AB Category 5 tropical cyclone Pam hit Vanuatu in March 2015, affecting
   thousands of people. Three months after the event, this study compared
   the responses from both external aid agencies and the disaster-affected
   communities to identify convergences, duplications and gaps. The
   research relies on 13 interviews with aid agencies and eight focus group
   discussions with participatory activities at local community level.
   While aid agencies actively responded during and after Pam, local people
   too responded to the event with strategies based on livelihoods
   diversification, food security techniques, traditional knowledge and
   cooperation intra- and inter-communities. The study emphasizes the need
   for an integrative approach where disaster responses from the top-down
   integrate that from the bottom-up. Aid agencies should build on the
   livelihood mechanisms developed at local level so responses and recovery
   can be more effective, socioculturally acceptable and may lead to
   sustainable outcomes of disaster risk reduction including climate change
   adaptation.

AB The Bahamian archipelago has a rich flora with 89 endemic species. An
   international symposium held at Nassau in October 2012 to celebrate the
   30th anniversary of the publication of the "Flora of the Bahama
   Archipelago" provided a forum to discuss plant conservation issues on
   these islands. This article builds on conclusions from this symposium
   and results from joint plant conservation research projects among the
   authors. The two main conservation challenges for these islands are: (1)
   environmental uncertainties derived from global warming and associated
   sea level changes and (2) the need for increased plant conservation
   awareness among the predominant urban population of the archipelago.
   Legal tools and biodiversity international agreements in place for The
   Commonwealth of the Bahamas can facilitate mechanisms for effective
   plant conservation. Further legal developments need to be established in
   The United Kingdom Overseas Territory of The Turks and Caicos Islands.
   There is an urgent need to redevelop the Botanic Garden of Nassau and
   designate it as the national botanic garden of The Bahamas. Further
   research related to the taxonomy, biology, conservation status, and
   distribution of the endemic species is urgently needed. Research
   initiatives pertinent to the detrimental effect and biology of invasive
   species are also lacking. The heterogeneous environments and uneven
   distribution of human populations across the archipelago are major
   challenges for conservation. Finally because of the political and
   economic status of The Bahamas and The Turks and Caicos, conservation
   agencies from the archipelago do not have easy access to international
   or British/European Union funds for global conservation initiatives.

AB The mangrove crab Aratus pisonii was considered to have an
   amphi-American distribution; however, a recent study revealed that the
   Eastern Tropical Pacific populations were genetically distinct, thus
   representing a new species: Aratus pacificus. These species separated by
   the Isthmus of Panama have diverged under different environmental
   conditions that may have influenced their reproductive biology. As the
   available information about this genus concerns almost exclusively the
   Caribbean species, the aim of the present study was to analyse and
   compare reproductive aspects of A. pacificus and A. pisonii obtained
   from both the Pacific and Caribbean coasts of Costa Rica. Females were
   collected from April 2011 to April 2012, and reproductive features such
   as breeding season, size distribution of ovigerous females, fecundity,
   reproductive output, embryo volume and embryo water content were
   assessed. Both species produced embryos during the entire sampled
   period. Most females of A. pacificus carrying embryos close to hatching
   were found during the rainy season. Ovigerous females of A. pisonii were
   substantially larger and reached sexual maturity at a larger size than
   females of A. pacificus. Embryo production started in A. pacificus at a
   smaller female size than in A. pisonii. As fecundity increased with
   female size, the average fecundity was lower in A. pacificus. Females of
   A. pisonii produced larger embryos, which might be related to lower food
   availability: higher energy content in the embryo enhances the chances
   of larval survival. These data regarding reproductive features of the
   Pacific and Caribbean species support the conclusion to separate A.
   pacificus from A. pisonii.

AB Set in the Aramia River basin, this article explores the intimate and
   interactive relationship between communities in Western Province, Papua
   New Guinea, and the water that dominates the environment in which they
   live. Located amongst tidal rivers, creeks and lagoons, Gogodala
   villages sit high on 'islands' of land. In this environment, water is
   the site of seasonal change and the space of movement. The Aramia River
   is synonymous with an ancestral figure called Sawiya who travelled in
   her canoe, naming, creating and populating the water and land of the
   area. As the 'mother of all fish', Sawiya controls the movement and
   abundance of fish and other aquatic resources. Water is embodied in
   Sawiya, whose capacities to both nourish and punish are the basis of
   seasonal variations in fish, and in the colour and clarity of water in
   the local lagoons and rivers. Set against the backdrop of the Ok Tedi
   Mine and recent logging operations on the Aramia, the article explores
   some of the ways in which water and its resources are defined and
   experienced in this rural community and the impact this may have on the
   exploitation and development of natural resources in PNG.

AB Larval dispersal is a critical yet enigmatic process in the persistence
   and productivity of marine metapopulations. Empirical data on larval
   dispersal remain scarce, hindering the use of spatial management tools
   in efforts to sustain ocean biodiversity and fisheries. Here we document
   dispersal among subpopulations of clownfish (Amphiprion percula) and
   butterflyfish (Chaetodon vagabundus) from eight sites across a large
   seascape (10,000 km(2)) in Papua New Guinea across 2 years. Dispersal of
   clownfish was consistent between years, with mean observed dispersal
   distances of 15 km and 10 km in 2009 and 2011, respectively. A Laplacian
   statistical distribution (the dispersal kernel) predicted a mean
   dispersal distance of 13-19 km, with 90% of settlement occurring within
   31-43 km. Mean dispersal distances were considerably greater (43-64 km)
   for butterfly-fish, with kernels declining only gradually from spawning
   locations. We demonstrate that dispersal can be measured on spatial
   scales sufficient to inform the design of and test the performance of
   marine reserve networks.

AB The Solomon Islands face problems of vitamin A deficiency and infectious
   diseases, including malaria. It is essential to identify nutrient-rich
   indigenous foods for preventing and alleviating these diseases. Previous
   work in Micronesia identified yellow/orange-fleshed carotenoid-rich
   banana cultivars, in particular Fe'i cultivars (characterized by upright
   bunches), with potential to alleviate vitamin A deficiency. Although
   there is a great diversity of Solomon Islands bananas, little is
   documented about these cultivars and their nutrient content. Using an
   ethnographic approach, this study aimed to identify nutrient-rich
   cultivars and to collect information relating to production and
   consumption. Seven Fe'i cultivars (not previously analyzed) and three
   non-Fe'i cultivars were assessed for flesh color, fruit size and other
   attributes and analyzed for provitamin A carotenoids (beta- and
   alpha-carotene), total carotenoids and riboflavin. Five Fe'i and two
   non-Fe'i cultivars were identified as carotenoid-rich. Of 10 cultivars
   analyzed the concentrations of beta-carotene equivalents ranged from 45
   to 7124 mu g/100g. Compared to cultivars with light-colored flesh, the
   yellow/orange-fleshed cultivars generally contained higher carotenoid
   concentrations. All Fe'i cultivars contained riboflavin, from 0.10 to
   2.72 mg/100 g, some having substantial concentrations. The nutrient-rich
   cultivars, including Fe'i, should be promoted for their potential to
   contribute to vitamin A intake and overall health. (C) 2010 Elsevier

AB Benthic and pelagic communities in the central Gulf of Papua, a major
   deltaic clinoform located on the south coast of Papua New Guinea,
   reflect the spatial and seasonal patterns in physical sedimentation
   conditions and the availability of food resources across this system.
   The distribution of terrigenous and marine organic substrates, the
   transport of riverine-derived sediment, and seafloor dynamics are
   largely controlled by two seasons and wind patterns: the relatively
   quiescent NW Monsoon and more energetic SE Trades. The physically
   disturbed inner-topset deposits (<20 m) are dominated at all times by
   bacterial biomass and have depressed numbers of macrofauna, with
   evidence of periodic recolonization recorded in sedimentary structures.
   The inner-topset region also shows strong seasonality in the production
   and availability of labile organic matter and in bacterial activity. As
   measured by the concentrations of photopigments and microbial biomass in
   the upper 2 cm of surface sediments and in the water column, the
   comparatively quiescent NW Monsoon period is associated with net
   delivery of reactive substrates as labile organic matter to the bottom
   and net growth of the benthic microbial community, whereas the
   Transition period between the NW Monsoonal-Winds ( NW Monsoon) and SE
   Trade-Winds ( SE Trades), and the SE Trades, are periods of reactive
   substrate depletion in bottom deposits and decreased benthic bacterial
   and macroinfaunal biomass. In contrast to the inner-topset, the less
   physically disturbed outer-topset and foreset show relatively enhanced,
   but still low, abundances of large macrobenthos and possible evidence of
   variation related to food supply. The greatest observed seasonal
   variation in macrofauna occurs in the Umuda Valley off the Fly River, an
   apparent mobile sediment conduit.

   Looe Key in the Florida Keys.  This new species appears to be most
   closely related to P. iridescens Lebour, 1949, described originally from
   Bermuda.  Periclimenes patae can be separated from the holotype of P.
   iridescens by fewer rostral teeth, second pereopods equal or nearly
   equal in size, chelae of second pereopods lacking distinct teeth,
   dactyls of pereopods 3-5 entire (not bifid), and a nearly transparent
   body in life.  There is confusion over the previous northwestern
   Atlantic records for P. iridescens from Venezuela, Colombia, Curacao,
   Gulf of Mexico, and east coast of the United States.  Our observations
   and research indicate the existence of at least three additional
   undescribed species within the "iridescens" complex from the western

AB Trinidad and Tobago is plagued with a perennial flooding problem. The
   higher levels of rainfall in the wet season often lead to extensive
   flooding in the low-lying areas of the Country. This has lead to
   significant damage to livestock, agricultural produce, homes and
   businesses particularly in the Caparo River Basin. Clearly, there is a
   need for developing flood mitigation and management strategies to manage
   flooding in the areas most affected. This paper utilizes geographic
   information systems to map the extent of the flooding, estimate soil
   loss due to erosion and estimate sediment loading in the rivers in the
   Caparo River Basin. In addition. the project required the development of
   a watershed management plan and a flood control plan. The results
   indicate that flooding Was Caused by several factors including clear
   cutting or vegetative cover, especially in areas of steep slopes that
   lead to sediment filled rivers and narrow waterways. Other factors
   include poor agricultural practices, and uncontrolled development in
   floodplains. Recommendations to manage floods ill the Caparo River Basin
   have been provided. (c) 2007 published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Natural products continue to provide a diverse and unique source of
   bioactive lead compounds for drug discovery, but maintaining their
   continued eminence as source compounds is challenging in the face of the
   changing face of the pharmaceutical industry and the changing nature of
   biodiversity prospecting brought about by the Convention on Biological
   Diversity. This review provides an overview of some of these challenges
   and suggests ways in which they can be addressed so that natural
   products research can remain a viable and productive route to drug
   discovery. Results from International Cooperative Biodiversity Groups
   (ICBGs) working in Madagascar, Panama, and Suriname are used as examples
   of what can be achieved when biodiversity conservation is linked to drug
   discovery.

AB To date there have been only few case studies that specify how
   hydrological processes regulated by forests convey into benefits for
   society. The objective of this paper is to analyse the relation between
   forest cover and the reduction of flood risks on Trinidad. Our
   hypothesis is that the relation between forest cover and flood control
   is non-linear, in other words that deforestation of a watershed will
   increase flood risks in a non-linear way. This implies that the per
   hectare value of the hydrological service is determined in part by the
   remaining forest cover of the catchment. We find that this varies
   strongly between watersheds, between 16 and 268 US $ per hectare per
   year. Our results demonstrate a nonlinear relationship between
   catchment's forest cover and the generation of the flood control
   service, and indicate that even small levels of deforestation can lead
   to a significant increase in flood risks in Trinidad. (C) 2015 Elsevier

   Fauvel, Harmonia conformis (Boisduval), Menochilus duodecimpunctatus
   (Fauvel), Micraspis lineola (Fabricius), Orcus australasiae Boisduval,
   and Curinus coeruleus (Mulsant). After our investigations, the current
   described ladybird beetle fauna totals 44 named species, belonging to 18
   valid genera. The endemism rate is 47.7% (21 species), with one endemic
   subgenus, Scymnus (Caledonus). Based on comparisons of the coccinellid
   faunas of surrounding regions, the New Caledonian fauna has affinities
   with Australia and Papua New Guinea more than with the rest of the
   Pacific area. At least 19 species (43.2%) seem to have been introduced

AB Carbon and nitrogen stable isotopes (delta C-13 and delta N-15) were
   used to examine trophic niche dynamics of three co-occurring predators
   in The Bahamas. Variable estimates of core trophic niche width and total
   trophic niche overlap were observed between nurse sharks (Ginglymostoma
   cirratum), southern stingrays (Hypanus americanus), and Atlantic chupare
   stingrays (Styracura schmardae). Nurse sharks exhibited little trophic
   overlap with either species of stingray and exhibited higher delta N-15
   values, suggesting limited potential resource competition. Southern and
   Atlantic chupare stingrays exhibited higher total trophic niche overlap,
   highlighting higher levels of resource competition. Nurse sharks
   exhibited the broadest delta C-13 range, implying utilization of
   multiple resource pools to facilitate energetic requirements, compared
   with southern stingrays and Atlantic chupare stingrays. Southern
   stingrays exhibited the smallest core trophic niche width, highlighting
   reliance upon a narrower range of resource pools, likely supported by a
   single habitat type. We postulate that the persistence of the three
   sub-sampled predator populations is supported by potential resource
   partitioning and utilization of multiple trophic resource pools. Further
   information regarding trophic niche dynamics and patterns of resource
   use is required for data-poor species to identify how populations and
   communities may respond to the adverse effects of exploitation, such as
   fisheries impacts, habitat alteration, and pollution.

AB Caribbean seagrass habitats provide food and protection for
   reef-associated juvenile fish. The invasive seagrass Halophila
   stipulacea is rapidly altering these seascapes. Since its arrival in the
   Caribbean in 2002, H. stipulacea has colonized and displaced native
   sea-grasses, but the function of this invasive seagrass as a juvenile
   fish habitat remains unknown. To compare diversity, community structure,
   and abundance of juvenile fish between H. stipulacea and native seagrass
   beds, fish traps were deployed in four nearshore bays around St. Thomas,
   U.S. Virgin Islands. Traps were deployed in Frenchman, Lindbergh, and
   Sprat Bays for 24 h intervals in patches of bare sand, patches of H.
   stipulacea and patches of the native Caribbean seagrasses Thalassia
   testudinum and Syringodium filiforme. Traps were then deployed in
   Brewers Bay for 12 h intervals in stands of H. stipulacea and S.
   filiforme. Relative and total abundances of juvenile fish, identified at
   least to family, were compared across treatment habitats for each trap
   deployment period. The catch from H. stipulacea, compared to native
   seagrasses, comprised a greater abundance of nocturnal carnivores
   Lutjanus synagris (family Lutjanidae) and Haemulon flavolineatum (family
   Haemulidae). Additionally, the herbivore species Sparisoma aurofrenatum
   (family Labridae) and Acanthurus bahianus (family Acanthuridae) and the
   diurnal carnivore species Pseudopeneus maculatus (family Mullidae) were
   relatively scarce in H. stipulacea. The catch from sand was much
   smaller, compared to vegetated habitats, and comprised only L. synagris,
   H. flavolineatum, and H. aurolineatum. These results provide evidence of
   reduced family diversity and altered juvenile fish assemblages in H.
   stipulacea, driven by an abundance of some nocturnal carnivores and
   scarcity of herbivores and diurnal carnivores. The findings from the
   present work underpin the need for further investigation and mitigation
   of this invasion, particularly where H. stipulacea is driving
   seascape-alterations of key juvenile fish habitats.

   between 6.5[degree] and 7.5[degree] S latitude and 156.5[degree] and
   157.5[degree] E longitude. The central part of the island is suggested
   for inclusion in the Pacific-Asia Biodiversity Transect (PABITRA)
   system. The proposed area consists of the north-central coast, Mount
   Barokasa (850 m), Mount Maetabe (1,060 m), and the primary watershed
   systems that drain these mountains and the central plateau between them.
   Some of the concerns and expectations of traditional land owners and the
   Solomon Islands government are considered. These play important roles in
   any research activity and will be central to the success or failure of
   the project. The Solomon Islands, Lauru, and the specific study area are
   briefly described with synopses of previous research and current,
   preliminary research activities. Preliminary species checklists are
   given for plants and vertebrates in the area. Initially we propose to
   establish two transects, each passing through two biomes suitable for
   comparisons with similar biomes in other PABITRA sites: the tropical
   montane cloud forest of Mount Maetabe (the highest point in the Island),
   and the lowland rain forests, between 200 and 500 in in elevation to the
   southwest of Susuka at the base of Mount Barokasa. The two proposed
   transects will stretch through two different watersheds, one of which
   has had traditional agriculture practiced in the coastal strand area and
   the other of which has bad traditional agriculture practiced in the
   lowland forest of midelevations. A research agenda is proposed that will
   help achieve key objectives of developing local research capacity and
   internal biodiversity management systems while conserving traditional
   knowledge.

AB An index capturing the anomalies of the zonal wind at 925 hPa from 1950
   to 2010 was defined to explore the relationship between the fluctuations
   of the Caribbean low-level jet (CLLJ) and the main climate variability
   modes affecting the Intra-Americas Sea Region. El Nino Southern
   Oscillation (ENSO) events, here defined using the Nino 3.4 index, are
   found to be the most important variability modes for the jet anomalies,
   in agreement with previous studies. However, the Pacific Decadal
   Oscillation (PDO) and the Pacific/North American (PNA) teleconnection
   pattern also show significant correlations with the CLLJ anomaly index
   during February. The North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) and the Arctic
   Oscillation (AO) reveal a possible interaction with the jet anomalies
   that could be connected with the cold fronts and cold air surges
   arriving to the Caribbean basin from the Northern Hemisphere during
   winter. A composite technique is used to explain the correlations with
   the Pacific indexes. We found that ENSO events are connected to CLLJ
   anomalies by modulating the sea-level pressure (SLP) near the east coast
   of the United States and the Aleutian Low. The pattern displayed by the
   SLP anomalies (SLPa) is also associated with the PNA. During warm (cold)
   ENSO phases, negative (positive) anomalies in the SLP field over the
   east coast of North America produce cyclonic (anticyclonic) circulations
   at low levels. However, the ENSO signal in the SLPa and the PNA pattern
   are modulated by the phases of the PDO. Results indicate that when the
   ENSO and PDO are in phase (out of phase), the SLPa signal is enhanced
   (weakened or cancelled), affecting the CLLJ anomalies in both direction
   and intensity, also changing the spatial distribution of precipitation.

   cladistically to include seven Pacific and Asian species. Biogeographic
   relationships among island areas housing platynine taxa on the
   Australian and Pacific Plates are investigated using a chrono - area
   cladogram, i.e. a taxon - area cladogram for which terminals are dated
   based on geological evidence and internal nodes based on non-reversible
   temporal optimisation. Conclusions reached by constraining the ages of
   areas within the context of phylogenetic relationships of their resident
   taxa include: ( 1) Vanuatu has supported resident platynine taxa since
   the Middle to Late Miocene; ( 2) the Hawaiian Blackburnia first
   colonised that archipelago in the Miocene, long before the present
   oldest high island, Kauai, came into existence; ( 3) the New Zealand
   Ctenognathus most likely arose from Miocene colonisation of New Zealand
   via Fiji; and ( 4) the low diversity of the Tahitian platynine fauna is
   due to relatively recent, Pliocene or later, colonisation of the Society
   Island chain by this group, also from a Fijian source.

AB Cholera, present in Haiti since October 2010, persisted in early 2014 in
   several places, each with its own particular epidemiological
   characteristics. The scarcity of fresh water probably contributed to the
   spread of the disease in some rural areas. Population gatherings in
   places without an access to either safe water or sanitation
   infrastructure were another factor. Outreach activities of hygiene
   promotion and improving access to chlorinated water had positive
   results. The disappearance of cholera in areas where effective
   preventive actions were conducted supports the conclusion that its
   transmission is predominantly interhuman, without the sustainable
   installation of the pathogenic Vibrio in the Haitian environment. These
   actions must be modulated according to the various areas.

   pterotracheid heteropod molluscs was analyzed from 160 zooplankton
   samples collected during four cruises carried out in oceanic and neritic
   areas of the Mexican Caribbean Sea and the southern Gulf of Mexico. Four
   species were identified, Firoloida desmaresti being the most abundant,
   followed by Pterotrachea hippocampus, Cardiapoda placenta, and P.
   coronata. These records represent over half the number of species known
   in the entire Gulf of Mexico and the Caribbean Sea. No differences of
   abundance or species composition were recorded when spring and summer
   data were compared in neritic and oceanic waters of the Gulf of Mexico.
   The overall density of heteropods in the surveyed area is relatively
   higher than in other regions. The finding of Pterotrachea coronata in
   the Mexican Caribbean Sea represents a new geographic record for the
   heteropod fauna of the western Caribbean Sea. A dichotomic key for the
   identification of the species recorded in this survey is presented
   herein. This is the first survey of the Mexican Atlantic oceanic
   heteropod fauna.

AB Healthy coral reefs are biologically diverse and provide vital ecosystem
   services. However, decreasing water quality and global warming are key
   contributors to coral reef decline, which poses substantial
   environmental threats. In response to this degradation, an innovative
   coral reef restoration technology, called Biorock, utilizes weak direct
   current electric fields to cause limestone deposition on conductive
   materials, inevitably inducing prolific coral reef growth. Although
   expediting coral growth, research on how the associated electric fields
   may impact the behavioural patterns of teleosts and/or organisms (i.e.
   elasmobranchs) possessing electroreception capabilities is lacking.
   Therefore, we studied the behavioural responses of two shark species,
   the bull shark (Carcharhinus leucas) and the Caribbean reef shark
   (Carcharhinus perezi) and multiple teleost species towards weak direct
   current electric fields in Bimini, Bahamas. Generalized linear mixed
   model analyses based on 90 trials illustrate that both the feeding and
   avoidance behaviors of C. leucas and C. perezi were significantly
   associated with treatment type, with the weak experimental electrode
   treatments resulting in the greatest quantity of avoidances and fewest
   feedings for both species. However, data analyses illustrate that
   teleost feeding behavior was not observably impacted by experimental
   treatments. Although the Biorock technology exhibits promise in coral
   reef restoration, the findings from this study illustrate a need for
   future large-scale studies assessing shark behavioral patterns around
   these devices, since the deterrence of apex predators may impact
   ecosystem balance.

AB This study examines the water, sanitation and hygiene situation in 42
   schools in Haiti after the earthquake of January 12, 2010, by using a
   comprehensive approach, which includes participatory assessment tools
   and formal surveys. By conducting a detailed assessment of school water
   and sanitation infrastructure conditions and of the perceptions of
   students and professors, a series of recommendations are provided to
   support further project implementation towards more sustainable results.
   Direct observations showed that schools lack safe drinking water,
   appropriate sanitation and hand washing facilities. The main constraints
   to improve the water, sanitation and hygiene services were found to be
   related to lack of funding and infrastructure losses after the
   earthquake. Moreover, hygiene education is commonly not part of the
   school curriculum. Providing schools with adequate access to water and
   sanitation facilities and supporting the implementation of hygiene
   promotion programs, including a disaster risk preparedness plan, can
   play significant roles for a sustainable recovery phase.

   The present study documents new records of opisthobranchs resulting from
   fieldwork along the Caribbean coast of Costa Rica. A total of 70 species
   were collected and identified, 17 of which represent new records to
   Costa Rica. This increases the total known opisthobranch diversity to
   152 species in the studied area. Potential species complexes were
   identified and commented. Future surveys, detailed species reports and
   comparative morphological and molecular studies are needed to improve
   the knowledge on the Caribbean opisthobranch fauna.

AB A series of monoliths collected from Ambra Crater in the Upper Wahgi
   valley, Papua New Guinea have been subject to multiproxy (pollen
   microcharcoal and diatom) palaeoecological investigation. The
   palaeoecological record enables a relatively high-resolution
   construction from c. 4000-500 cal. BP. Throughout the sequence, the
   valley floor and crater area were continuously deforested and carpeted
   with a grassland-disturbance taxa mosaic. Vegetation communities in the
   valley were largely unaffected by successive tephra deposition events,
   although some muted effects occurred. Tephra deposition did have
   considerable local effects on soil water conditions and hydrology in the
   base of the crater. The Ambra Crater record is consistent with longer
   chronologies from wetlands in the Upper Wahgi valley, which document
   extensive disturbance to dryland forests and their replacement with
   grasses and other disturbance taxa from the mid Holocene. The Ambra
   Crater record, taken in conjunction with previously published multisite
   data, enables critique and discrimination of different interpretations
   of agricultural history in the highlands during the late Holocene.

AB The Australian public as well as Australian funding bodies are generally
   unsympathetic to native murids, rats and mice, in spite of the fact that
   36% have either become extinct or critically endangered since European
   settlement. The endemic Australian parasites of these rats and mice have
   been even less sympathetically regarded. Prior to 1958 very little work
   was carried out on the helminths of Australian rodents and little more
   is known today. Records are known from only 28% of the extant host
   species, comprising some 109 species of helminth identified at least to
   generic level. The rodents invaded Australia from the north, perhaps
   through New Guinea in at least two separate waves, 5-8 then about 1
   million years ago. The parasites they brought with them have adapted and
   speciated and there has been some host switching between rodent groups
   and between rodents and the Australian marsupials. This is illustrated
   particularly in the Trichostrongyloidea. The origins of the rodents from
   Southeast Asia down the Indonesian island chain are reflected in the
   presence of the nematode genus Tikusnema in both Australia and
   Indonesia, and Cyclodontostomum purvisi across Southeast Asia and into
   New Guinea. Hydromys chrysogaster, the Australian water-rat, illustrates
   how the biogeographical influences of the host's distribution and
   lifestyle can affect its parasite fauna. Most of the research to date is
   merely indicative of where more data are needed. The links between
   Australian and New Guinean helminth fauna, as well as the links between
   rodent and marsupial hosts and their fauna, cannot be determined without
   further research. (C) 1998 Australian Society for Parasitology.

AB Sexual dimorphism in bill morphology and body size of the Caribbean
   purple-throated carib hummingbird is associated with a reversal in. oral
   dimorphism of its Heliconia food plants. This hummingbird is the sole
   pollinator of H. caribaea and H. bihai, with flowers of the former
   corresponding to the short, straight bills of males, the larger sex, and
   flowers of the latter corresponding to the long, curved bills of
   females. On St. Lucia, H. bihai compensates for the rarity of H.
   caribaea by evolving a second color morph with flowers that match the
   bills of males, whereas on Dominica, H. caribaea evolves a second color
   morph with flowers that match the bills of females. The nectar rewards
   of all Heliconia morphs are consistent with each sex's choice of the
   morph that corresponds to its bill morphology and energy requirements,
   supporting the hypothesis that feeding preferences have driven their
   coadaptation.

   Islands, local biodiversity is threatened and traditional ecological
   knowledge (TEK) is in danger of being lost. Herpetofauna, in particular,
   are globally threatened, along with their associated cultural knowledge
   and beliefs. The aim of this study was to examine the species richness
   and conservation status of herpetofauna and associated TEK among the
   'Are'Are on Malaita Island, Solomon Islands. Questionnaire surveys were
   used to collect information about local perceptions and knowledge
   regarding frogs, skinks, and geckos, as well as their forest habitats.
   Local informants were distributed equally between sexes and age groups.
   A total of 18 different species of frogs and lizards were recorded and
   characterized. Seven distinct cultural uses were identified. Informants
   above the age of 60 exhibited greater herpetofaunal knowledge, as
   measured by number of species identified, with males demonstrating
   knowledge of slightly more species than females. Our results show that
   action is warranted to document and preserve community TEK in the
   Solomon Islands as step towards preserving biodiversity and supporting
   cultural conservation.

   in local food-web persistence. The conservation status of the site, in
   turn, is associated with an increase in food-web persistence. Some of
   these associations are explained through effects on food-web structure
   and total community biomass. Our results unveil a hidden footprint of
   human activities. Even when food webs may seem healthy in terms of the
   presence and abundance of their constituent species, they may be losing
   the capacity to withstand further environmental degradation.

   Vanuatu archipelago in 2006 and 2007, ten new species of tateid
   gastropods confined to springs, the upper most, slowly flowing regions
   of streams or the groundwater had been discovered. These species were
   now described based on shell morphology and anatomy. In accordance with
   geography, these characters placed the species from Vanuatu between
   those from New Caledonia and Fiji, suggesting a stepping stone-like
   dispersal across the Pacific with an origin in New Zealand and the far
   end on the Austral islands. We also assessed the threat status of the
   new species according to the IUCN Red List criteria and concluded that
   they should be amended by explicit incorporation of the scale of
   potential human impact or stochastic natural events relative to the size
   of the habitat of organisms.

   (ODP) Site 999 (12degrees44'N, 78degrees44'W, water depth 2828 m)
   spanning the interval from 8.5 to 5.3 Ma. Low epibenthic delta(13)C
   values and low amounts of sand-sized particles (mostly foraminifer
   shells) indicate a poorly ventilated deep Caribbean throughout the late
   Miocene. At this time the deep Caribbean was dominated by a
   nutrient-rich and corrosive water mass. A generally constant delta(13)C
   gradient between the Caribbean and deep Atlantic records during the late
   Miocene suggests that the fluctuations in delta(13)C reflect global
   changes in delta(13)C of the dissolved inorganic carbon due to varying
   erosion of organic carbon from terrigenous soils and shelf sediments.
   The observed 100-kyr cyclicity of epibenthic delta(13)C is in good
   accordance with the variability of terrigenous input to the equatorial
   Atlantic as recorded by magnetic susceptibility records of the Ceara
   Rise. However, some short-term gradient changes between 7.0 and 4.5 Ma
   indicate a poorer ventilation of the deep Atlantic related to a reduced
   production of deep water in the Atlantic. The Messinian Salinity Crisis
   between 6.0 and 5.3 Ma did not affect the intermediate to deep water
   gradient between the Caribbean and the Atlantic. Comparison to the
   Bahama platform record of ODP Site 1006, however, indicates a poorer
   ventilation of the shallower northern Caribbean basins coincident with
   the isolation of the Mediterranean Sea.

AB Assessing the patterns of diversity of the phylum Mollusca along the
   extensive Mexico's littoral zones represent a challenging task. However,
   one can argue that the biodiversity of a country can properly be
   expressed using descriptive variables such as species richness. With
   this in mind, the present study attempts to estimate the total number of
   species composing the marine Mexican mollusk fauna. For this purpose, an
   extensive literature search was conducted, consulting both national and
   international sources. This effort revealed the existence of a total of
   4 643 marine mollusk species distributed as follows: 2 576 in the
   Pacific and 2 067 in the Gulf of Mexico and the Caribbean. It is herein
   included a brief morphological description, nutritional and habitat
   characteristics, as well as endemic components. The historical records
   of new species of marine mollusk described in Mexico, mostly made by
   foreign scientist, dating back 250 years were reviewed. Undoubtedly, the
   marine mollusk fauna diversity of Mexico would be significantly enriched
   with the explorations of the deep sea, hidrothermal vents, islands, and
   with the increasing sampling effort in coastal lagoons and coral reef
   habitats.

AB Caffeine, a purine alkaloid drug, has been recognized as a contaminant
   of water bodies in various climatic regions, however, these
   environmental caffeine concentrations are the first to be reported in
   the tropical Caribbean. The major objective of this study was to develop
   an improved method to extract caffeine from surface and wastewaters in
   the warm Caribbean environment and measure caffeine concentrations in
   highly populated areas in Barbados. Caffeine was extracted from water
   via solid phase extraction (SPE); the acidified water samples were
   loaded onto C-18 cartridges and eluted with pure chloroform. The
   extracted caffeine was quantified using gas chromatography mass
   spectroscopy - multiple reaction monitoring (GC-MS/MS-MRM). Method
   detection limits of 0.2 ng L-1 from 1 L water samples were achieved.
   Caffeine was detected in all environmental water samples investigated.
   The concentrations of caffeine in surface waters were detected in the
   range 0.1 - 6.9 mu g L-1. The two wastewater treatment plants, primary
   and secondary treatment systems, significantly differed in their ability
   to eliminate caffeine in the raw sewage (38% and 99% caffeine removal
   efficiencies respectively). Thus, it may be essential to employ
   secondary treatment to effectively remove caffeine from wastewater
   systems in Barbados. Caffeine in water bodies are principally attributed
   to anthropogenic sources as caffeine-producing plants are not commonly
   grown on the island of Barbados. The study also shows the recalcitrance
   of caffeine to hydrolytic degradation.

AB Interspecific relationships of invasive species hosting a native
   associated species are noteworthy, particularly if the invasive does not
   have a similar relationship in its native range. The azooxanthellate
   Indo-Pacific coral Tubastraea coccinea (Dendrophylliidae) has become a
   widespread invasive in the tropical western Atlantic, where it was
   probably introduced as a fouling organism in the 1930s. During recent
   coral reef surveys this invader has been observed as host for a native
   tube worm, Spirobranchus giganteus (Serpulidae), at Curacao, where this
   association was most commonly found on a shipwreck. Although
   Spirobranchus species are known to live in association with various
   shallow-water corals in the Atlantic and the Indo-Pacific, none of them
   has been recorded as an associate of a dendrophylliid or of an
   azooxanthellate coral before. This new association may be possible
   because of the generalist host selection of S. giganteus, which could
   have been facilitated by the availability of shipwrecks and other
   man-made substrates.

AB Salmonella spp. are gram-negative bacteria capable of causing diseases
   in a wide range of aquatic and terrestrial animals, including humans.
   Sea and terrestrial turtles have been recognized as carriers of this
   zoonotic pathogen. In this project, conventional and molecular
   diagnostic methods were combined to investigate the prevalence of
   Salmonella enterica in leatherback sea turtles (Dermochelys coriacea)
   that used the island of St. Kitts, West Indies as a nesting ground
   during 2011 (n = 21). Isolates obtained from selective media were
   screened and colonies suspected of being Salmonella spp. were confirmed
   by fluorescence resonance energy transfer polymerase chain reaction. The
   prevalence of S. enterica within this sample population during this
   period was found to be 14.2%. Moreover, due to the increasing risk of
   antibiotic resistance in enteric bacteria, antimicrobial susceptibility
   was investigated in all recovered Salmonella spp. isolates utilizing the
   broth microdilution method. All isolates were susceptible to the lowest
   concentration of kanamycin, gentamicin, ciprofloxacin, enrofloxacin,
   nalidixic acid, and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole tested. Further
   research should be pursued to understand the interaction of this
   bacterial pathogen with the environment, host, and other microbial
   communities, and to further develop faster, more sensitive, and more
   specific diagnostic methods.

AB It has been 40 years since the first recorded toxic bloom of Pyrodinium
   bahamense occurred in Papua New Guinea in 1972. Subsequently this
   species has increased in importance as a paralytic shellfish poisoning
   toxin (PSTs) producer in several regions of the world, especially in the
   Indo-west Pacific. P. bahamense is a thecate tropical/subtropical
   euryhaline dinoflagellate. Available data indicate that it forms blooms
   only in waters of 20 psu or higher salinity and at temperatures above 20
   degrees C. It is monospecies with two varieties, namely var. compressum
   and var. bahamense. For many years it was widely accepted that only var.
   cornpressum is toxic and is limited to the tropical Pacific while var.
   bahamense is nontoxic and is limited to the tropical Atlantic. It is now
   known, however, that there are at least two locations where the
   varieties co-occur and it has also been proven that var. bahamense in
   Florida waters also produce PST. P. bahamense has a life cycle typical
   of many dinoflagellates. It has a heterothallic sexual cycle that
   produces a large spiny spherical resting cyst. The toxicity profile of
   P. bahamense is also very simple with most isolates producing only
   dc-STX, STX, neoSTX, B1 and B2 toxins. Further studies are needed in
   order to resolve the varietal status of the species and also to
   understand the environmental factors that determine its toxicity and
   bloom dynamics. (C) 2011 Elsevier ay. All rights reserved.

AB Many of those concerned with the protection of the coastal waters in the
   Caribbean advocate the idea of alternative livelihoods: fishers would be
   offered livelihoods in tourism to replace the fishing that a marine
   protected area would curtail. Such livelihoods would provide a secure
   income linked to the tourism that a protected area would generate,
   turning fishers into supporters of environmental protection. The idea of
   alternative livelihoods assumes that livelihoods are reducible to the
   money that they bring in. This paper investigates the adequacy of this
   assumption among fishers in Port Antonio, a town on the north-east coast
   of Jamaica, and with reference to the values of reputation and
   respectability, important throughout the Caribbean. The assumption
   contained in the idea of alternative livelihoods does not apply to those
   fishers, because their fishing is not an economic activity reducible to
   income. Instead, fishers value economic activities and relationships
   very different from what they would confront in jobs in tourism.

AB This study uses empirical models to examine the potential impact of
   climate change, based on a range of 100-yr phase 5 of the Coupled Model
   Intercomparison Project (CMIP5) projections, on crop water need in
   Jamaica. As expected, crop water need increases with rising temperature
   and decreasing precipitation, especially in May-July. Comparing the
   temperature and precipitation impacts on crop water need indicates that
   the 25th percentile of CMIP5 temperature change (moderate warming)
   yields a larger crop water deficit than the 75th percentile of CMIP5
   precipitation change (wet winter and dry summer), but the 25th
   percentile of CMIP5 precipitation change (substantial drying) dominates
   the 75th percentile of CMIP5 temperature change (extreme warming). Over
   the annual cycle, the warming contributes to larger crop water deficits
   from November to April, while the drying has a greater influence from
   May to October. All experiments decrease crop suitability, with the
   largest impact from March to August.

AB Coral cover at lower mesophotic depths (particularly >75 m) by
   zooxanthellate scleractinians is usually very scarce, largely due to the
   extremely low irradiance levels at these depths. An exception are the
   Leptoseris communities observed near the Hawaiian islands (Central
   Pacific) that form dense fields, supporting a broad range of associated
   organisms. Here, we describe a similar high-cover coral community at
   lower mesophotic depths, but in the Caribbean. The community was
   observed on the leeward side of Curacao (Southern Caribbean) using a
   manned submersible (Curasub), and was predominantly composed of plating
   Agaricia corals and an assemblage of reef fishes. Some of the fish
   species were known from similar depths at other localities, whereas
   others obtained new depth records. Future surveys are required to
   establish the extent of similar high-coral communities around Curacao,
   and more broadly in the western Atlantic.

   two species of the genus Dendronotus Alder & Hancock described from
   tropical western Pacific waters. Both have unique color patterns as well
   as radulae that are distinct from other known species of the genus.
   Dendronotus regius sp. nov. is recorded from Indonesia, the Philippines
   and Malaysia while Dendronotus noahi sp. nov. is found in Papua New
   Guinea. Along with these descriptions, new data on D. gracilis Baba,
   1949 are given to provide supplemental information on its morphology and
   report an increase in its range to include the tropical waters of
   Okinawa, Japan. A comparative table as well as scanning electron

AB We fully described two Koellikerina species from shallow waters in Japan
   with illustrations and photographs. Koellikerina constricta (Menon,
   1932), bearing characteristic bell constriction, expands its
   distribution to Kuchinoerabu Island, Kagoshima Prefecture (northern
   limit). Koellikerina bouilloni n. sp. is added to eight known species of
   the genus Koellikerina on the basis of an absence of bell constriction,
   a colorless body, and the presence of adaxial ocelli, perradial gonads,
   and a peduncle by examining a specimen from Tanabe Bay, Wakayama
   Prefecture and 18 specimens formerly collected from Papua New Guinea.
   Although bell constriction has been criticized as a taxonomic character,
   we conclude that it is reliable among Koellikerina because all the K.
   bouilloni specimens at variable developmental stages lack bell
   constriction and are clearly distinguishable from K. constricta.

AB Marine reserves, areas protected from exploitative anthropogenic
   processes, are being widely implemented to conserve biodiversity and
   initiate species recovery. Evidence supports the effectiveness of marine
   reserves in improving biological attributes such as biodiversity,
   density, biomass, and body-size for sedentary species or those with
   r-selected life histories. However, there is limited long-term time
   series-based information determining the effectiveness of these
   protected areas for elasmobranchs. Marine reserve effectiveness is
   commonly evaluated spatially by examining differences in species'
   biological parameters inside and outside of protective boundaries, which
   can often mask the occurrence of slow population declines. We used a
   temporal fishery independent standardized longline survey at Glover's
   Reef Marine Reserve, Belize, to monitor long-term population trends in
   the commercially important Caribbean reef shark Carcharhinus perezi for
   more than a decade. Linear models were performed to examine whether the
   factors habitat, year, or their interaction had a significant impact on
   C. perezi catch per unit effort (CPUE) and on catch demographic
   composition. Only the factor habitat had a significant influence on CPUE
   with the forereef catch significantly higher than in the lagoon. Our
   results support that the population of Caribbean reef shark at Glover's
   Reef Marine Reserve appears stable with no significant decline in CPUE
   or decrease in mean total length detected. This is evidence that marine
   reserves can be an effective conservation tool for reef-associated shark
   species.

AB This paper analyzes the creation of a landscape in Papua New Guinea over
   the past 3500 years under human influence. The Arawe Island group off
   the south coast of West New Britain Province in Papua New Guinea has
   been the subject of archaeological and geomorphological study from 1986
   to 1992. The evidence of sediments and the artifacts they contain offer
   a record of the long term history of the region.
   The fullest evidence comes from the Lapita period dating from 3500 to
   2000 bp., which has assemblages characterized by dentate stamped
   pottery, obsidian, and shell. During the Lapita period in the Arawes
   there is evidence of a clustered settlement pattern in the form of stilt
   villages built in shallow water on the lee sides of islands. These
   villages caused the build-up of beach sand beneath and around them; this
   has been preserved as law beach ridges by a slight fall in sea level (<1
   m). Clays eroded from the interiors of the islands have been dammed
   behind these beach ridges. Thus during the Lapita period many of the
   features of the lowland portions of the islands as they exist today were
   created by human patterns of land use.

AB Starches from eight Dioscorea alata cultivars grown in Jamaica were

   content ranging from 20.117 +/- 0.017 gKg(-1) for Darknight yam to
   23.001 +/- 0.058 gKg(-1) for Barbados. The starch granules were found to
   display an asymmetric "Maltese" cross upon exposure to polarized light
   with projected mean granule diameters ranging from 22.89 mu m to 28.01
   mu m. The starch granules were predominantly ellipsoidal in shape with
   only Renta yam and Barbados yam displaying triangular shaped granules.
   The swelling power of the starches were found to increase with
   temperature, with Moonshine (895.551 +/- 1.051%) having the highest
   swelling power and Renta yam (757.401 +/- 6.101%) the lowest at 95
   degrees C. Variations were also observed in the solubility, phosphorous
   content, crude fat content and gelatinization temperatures of the
   different yam starches. The properties of the different Dioscorea alata
   starches may prove useful in nutritional applications.

AB Landslides pose a serious physical and environmental threat to
   vulnerable communities living in areas of unplanned housing on steep
   slopes in the Caribbean. Some of these communities have, in the past,
   had to be relocated, at costs of millions of dollars, because of major
   slides triggered by tropical storm rainfall. Even so, evidence shows
   that: (1) risk reduction is a marginal activity; (2) there has been
   minimal uptake of hazard maps and vulnerability assessments and (3)
   there is little on-the-ground delivery of construction for risk
   reduction. This article directly addresses these issues by developing a
   low-cost approach to the identification of the potential pore pressure
   changes that trigger such slides we seek to address these three
   commentaries directly. A complex 45-60 degrees slope site in St Lucia,
   West Indies was selected as a pilot for a modelling approach that uses
   numerical models (FLAC and CHASM) to verify the need for surface water
   management to effectively reduce landslide risk. Following the model
   confirmation, a series of drains were designed and constructed at the
   site. Post-construction evidence indicates the methodology to be sound,
   in that the site was stable in subsequent 1-in-1 to 1-in-4 year rainfall
   events. A critical feature of the approach is that it is community-based
   from data acquisition through to community members participating in
   construction.

AB Saltwater crocodile (Crocodylus porosus) farming in Papua New Guinea is
   an emerging industry that supplies high-quality skins to the fashion
   industry. Crocodiles are semiaquatic and fed highquality feed made from
   extrudated animal byproducts (i.e., forced through a die at low pressure
   but not heat treated); however, it disintegrates on contact with water,
   and this leads to low utilization. Alginate is used extensively in food
   and pharmaceutical processes because it quickly forms a gel at room
   temperature; however, its effects on nutrient availability are
   equivocal, and its utility in crocodile diets is unknown. Extrudated
   chicken byproduct-based crocodile diets were formulated (asfed) with and
   without 1.7 and 3.3% Na alginate with either CaCl2 or CaCO3 to
   cross-link. After immersion in water at 30 degrees C for 24 h, feed
   retained on a 0.5-mm screen was measured to determine DM retention
   (DMR). Regardless of inclusion level, alginate addition resulted in a
   13-fold increase in DMR (P < 0.05) when CaCO3 was used as a Ca+ 2
   source; however, CaCl2 use resulted in a much lower DMR. In a
   digestibility trial, 10 juvenile crocodiles (2.2 to 2.4 yr of age; 1.2
   to 1.9 kg BW) were chosen from farm-raised stocks and fed extrudated
   chicken byproduct-based diets with and without 1.5% Na alginate and 1.9%
   CaCO3. Animals fed 2% BW for 12 d and with excreta collected the last 5
   d were slaughtered and had digesta sampled from the ileum. There were no
   differences in apparent ileal digestibilities of any AA, N (65.0 vs.
   55.8%, SE = 12.2%), and OM (46.8 vs. 39.6%, SE = 12.8%) between diets
   with and without alginate, respectively. Total-tract digestibilities of
   OM (69.8 vs. 39.2%, SE = 9.1%) and energy (72.2 vs. 44.4%, SE = 8.3%),
   however, were greater in alginate-containing diets (P < 0.05). Our study
   showed that alginate addition to crocodile feed improved its stability
   in water and did not impair nutrient digestion. Application of these
   findings should greatly decrease feed wastage, which ultimately will
   benefit Papua New Guinea by simultaneously increasing economic returns
   and decreasing environmental impacts.

AB This article examines food security in Funafuti, Tuvalu in the context
   of recent social-ecological changes. We consider both social and
   ecological processes in order to provide a holistic account of food
   security. An analysis of data collected through a fixed-question survey
   and freelists with 50 households and semistructured interviews with 25
   key informants reveal that access to food of sufficient nutritional and
   cultural value is the primary driver affecting food security, more so
   than general food availability. Ten percent of the households surveyed
   experienced a shortage of food in the previous month, and 52% ate less
   desirable imported foods, which tended to be nutrient poor because they
   could not access preferred local foods. Factors and processes affecting
   access to local foods include: availability of and access to land;
   declining involvement in local food production; the convenience of
   imported foods; unreliable interisland shipping; and climate and
   environmental changes that have negatively affected food security and
   are expected to continue to do so.

AB Objectives of this study were to determine the burden and impact of
   acute gastroenteritis (AGE) and foodborne pathogens in Trinidad and
   Tobago. A retrospective, cross-sectional population survey, based on
   self-reported cases of AGE, was conducted in November-December 2008 and
   May-June 2009 (high-and low-AGE season respectively) by face-to-face
   interviews. From 2,145 households selected to be interviewed, the
   response rate was 99.9%. Of those interviewed, 5.1% (n = 110; 95% CI
   4.3-6.2) reported having AGE (3 or more loose watery stools in 24 hours)
   in the 28 days prior to the interview (0.67 episodes/person-year).
   Monthly prevalence of AGE was the highest among children aged <5 years
   (1.3 episodes/year). Eighteen (16%) persons with AGE sought medical care
   (4 treated with oral rehydration salts and 6 with antibiotics), and 66%
   reported restricted activity [range 1-16 day(s)]. The mean duration of
   diarrhoea was 2.3 days (range 2-10 days). One case submitted a stool
   sample, and another was hospitalized. Overall, 56 (10%) AGE specimens
   tested positive for foodborne pathogens. It was estimated that 135,820
   AGE cases occurred in 2009 (84% underreporting), and for every 1 AGE
   case reported, an additional 6.17 cases occurred in the community. The
   estimated economic cost of AGE ranged from US$ 27,331 to 19,736,344.
   Acute gastroenteritis, thus, poses a huge health and economic burden on
   Trinidad and Tobago.

AB Very little research has considered the underlying drivers of land cover
   change in Caribbean islands, particularly in those islands that are
   still experiencing a net loss of forest cover. We investigated the
   underlying driving forces (socio-economic drivers) and spatial pattern
   drivers (biophysical features) of both deforestation and reforestation
   in the Cockpit Country, Jamaica. This area is one of the most globally
   important sites for plant diversity, but is threatened by clearance for
   small-scale agriculture. Drivers of change were assessed for both the
   individual time steps within the study period (1942-2010) and for the
   entire 68 years using multivariate, spatially explicit, statistical
   models. The primary drivers of deforestation over the study period were
   accestibility (gentler slopes, closer to forest edges, more fragmented
   forests) and greater relative wealth/socio-economic status (increased
   access to piped water). Reforestation generally increased closer to
   forest edges and in areas with lower market access (greater distances to
   roads and towns) and lower wealth/status (increased reliance on pit
   latrines). We found considerable temporal variation among the most
   important drivers for each time step, including climate, employment
   status, population density, population age structure and relative
   wealth. Forest reserve status was not a key determinant of deforestation
   but did increase the probability of reforestation between 1961 and 1980.
   During the final time step (2001-2010) access was less important as a
   deterrent to deforestation, which increased within the most contiguous
   forest blocks. If the deforestation drivers of the last decade do not
   change, deforestation is predicted to occur within the forest reserves,
   and in the largest, least fragmented forest blocks. Thus, conservation
   and management strategies for our study site must seek to address issues
   related to both enforcement and the socio-economic factors that
   influence deforestation and habitat fragmentation. (c) 2014 Elsevier

AB The South Pacific low latitude western boundary currents (LLWBCs) carry
   waters of subtropical origin through the Solomon Sea before joining the
   equatorial Pacific. Changes in their properties or transport are assumed
   to impact El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO) dynamics. At ENSO
   timescales, the LLWBCs transport tends to counterbalance the interior
   geostrophic one. When transiting through the complex geography of the
   Solomon Sea, the main LLWBC, the New Guinea Coastal Undercurrent, cannot
   follow a unique simple route to the equator. Instead, its routes and
   water mass properties are influenced by the circulation occurring in the
   Solomon Sea. In this study, the response of the Solomon Sea circulation
   to ENSO is investigated based on a numerical simulation. The transport
   anomalies entering the Solomon Sea from the south are confined to the
   top 250 m of the water column, where they represent 7.5 Sv (based on
   ENSO composites) for a mean transport of 10 Sv. The induced circulation
   anomalies in the Solomon Sea are not symmetric between the two ENSO
   states because of (1) a bathymetric control at Vitiaz Strait, which
   plays a stronger role during El Nino, and (2) an additional inflow
   through Solomon Strait during La Nina events. In terms of temperature
   and salinity, modifications are particularly notable for the thermocline
   water during El Nino conditions, with cooler and fresher waters compared
   to the climatological mean. The surface water at Vitiaz Strait and the
   upper thermocline water at Solomon Strait, feeding respectively the
   equatorial Pacific warm pool and the Equatorial Undercurrent,
   particularly affect the heat and salt fluxes. These fluxes can change by
   up to a factor of 2 between extreme El Nino and La Nina conditions.

AB The vascular flora at 50 small sidewalk plots in Greenpoint, Brooklyn,
   Kings County, NY, and also bordering St. John's University, Jamaica,
   Queens County, NY was identified and compared during spring and fall
   2007 through the spring and fall 2011 growing seasons. One hundred
   twenty-one vascular plant species within 94 genera and 37 families have
   been identified. Eighty-four taxa were identified in Brooklyn while 71
   taxa were identified in Queens; many taxa in Brooklyn were also found in
   Queens as well. Ninety-six taxa were identified at both sites in the
   spring while 55 taxa were identified in the fall. The Asteraceae (22
   species) and Poaceae (15 species) were the largest families in the
   flora. Eighty-five taxa, 69% of the flora, are not native to the region.
   Thirty-one taxa were observed only once during the 5-yr study; those
   observed only once, twice, and three times composed 50% of the flora. A
   parsimony algorithm was used to evaluate the distribution and
   co-occurrence of 121 vascular plant species identified at the above
   sites in Brooklyn and Queens in the fall and spring of 2007 to 2011. A
   total of 1,000 plots were sampled during the 5-yr study. The
   hierarchical cluster analysis forms two major clusters representing a
   Queens section, Queens fall 2007 to Queens fall 2011, and a Brooklyn
   section from Brooklyn fall 2007 to Brooklyn spring 2009. The data did
   not have enough resolution to produce a single unambiguous tree. This
   may be explained by the dynamic nature of these "islands," as many
   species colonize these "islands" briefly and disappear. The high
   diversity at the sidewalk plots may be a product of local disturbance.

AB Background: Cholera is newly emergent in Papua New Guinea but may soon
   become endemic. Identifying the risk factors for cholera provides
   evidence for targeted prevention and control measures.
   Methods: We conducted a hospital-based case-control study to identify
   cholera risk factors. Using stool culture as the standard, we evaluated
   a cholera point of care test in the field.
   Results: 176 participants were recruited: 54 cases and 122 controls.
   Independent risk factors for cholera were: being over 20 years of age
   (aOR 2.5; 95%CI 1.1, 5.4), defecating in the open air (or river) (aOR
   4.5; 95% CI 1.4, 14.4) and knowing someone who travelled to a cholera
   affected area (aOR 4.1; 95% CI 1.6, 10.7); while the availability of
   soap for handwashing at home was protective (aOR 0.41; 95% CI 0.19,
   0.87). Those reporting access to a piped water distribution system in
   the home were twice as likely to report the availability of soap for
   handwashing. The sensitivity and specificity of the rapid test were 72%
   (95% CI 47-90) and 71% (95% CI 44-90%).
   Conclusions: Improving population access to the piped water distribution
   system and sanitation will likely reduce transmission by enabling
   enhanced hygiene and limiting the contamination of water sources. The
   One step V. cholerae O1/O139 Antigen Test is of limited utility for
   clinical decision making in a hospital setting with access to
   traditional laboratory methods. Settlement dwellers and mobile
   populations of all age groups should be targeted for interventions in
   Papua New Guinea.

AB The Caribbean islands are a well-known biodiversity hotspot of global
   importance. Hispaniola (Dominican Republic and Haiti) is a highly
   diverse island with 42 % of its species endemic. Here we describe the
   new monotypic genus Tainus (Rubiaceae, Rondeletieae), which is endemic
   to the Sierra de Bahoruco-La Selle. This taxon was originally published
   as Rondeletia pitreana, but its taxonomic status has been doubtful. We
   performed phylogenetic analyses with three chloroplast regions (petD,
   trnK-matK and trnL-F) in order to test the relationships of R. pitreana
   to other species of Rondeletia and allied genera. Our molecular
   phylogeny underscores that R. pitreana does not belong to Rondeletia,
   but has an isolated position within Rondeletieae, whereas Acrosynanthus
   is sister to an assemblage of Mazaea, Phyllomelia, Rachicallis, Roigella
   and Rondeletia. The recognition of the genus Tainus is supported by
   molecular (simple sequence repeats) and morphological characters, among
   which the most conspicuous is the densely papillate ornamentation of the
   corolla mouth and lobes. Our findings reveal another case of endemism at
   a deeper phylogenetic level in flowering plants on Hispaniola.
   Furthermore, they emphasize the importance of exploring, collecting and
   performing phylogenetic analyses integrating samples from larger
   geographical areas across countries as a basis to support nature
   conservation.

AB Large lesions and widespread tissue loss in the sea fans Gorgonia
   ventalina and G. flabellum L. occurred throughout most of the Caribbean
   during 1995 and 1996. An earlier study identified the putative pathogen
   as a fungus in the genus Aspergillus (Smith et al. 1996). Repeated
   surveys showed that in the Bahamas the incidence (= % pf diseased sea
   fans) and virulence (= % tissue loss per diseased colony) of the disease
   increased rapidly from 1995 to 1996. Repeated surveys in Curacao and
   Saba showed Little variation in incidence and virulence. Incidence of
   the disease was higher on larger than on smaller colonies. On sheltered
   or moderately exposed shallow reefs (<12 m), both incidence and
   virulence were positively correlated with water depth. The number of
   lesions on diseased sea fans, measured only in Curacao, also increased
   with depth. These patterns may result from a decrease in wave action,
   which usually declines with water depth, and the consequent reduction in
   the swaying motion of the sea fans, thus affecting success of pathogen
   attachment and establishment. The sea fan predator snail Cypohoma
   gibbosum was more abundant on diseased than on healthy colonies but its
   density appears to have been too low to contribute significantly to
   infection and tissue loss. Algal tumors were found on both healthy and
   diseased colonies and showed no clear association with the disease.

AB Eight weather types (WTs) are computed over 98.75 degrees W-56.25
   degrees W, 8.75 degrees N-31.25 degrees N using cluster analysis of
   daily low-level (925 hPa) winds and outgoing long-wave radiation,
   without removing the mean annual cycle, by a k-means algorithm from 1979
   to 2013. The WTs can be firstly interpreted as snapshots of the annual
   cycle with a clear distinction between 5 "wintertime" and 3 "summertime"
   WTs, which account together for 70 % of the total mean annual rainfall
   across the studied domain. The wintertime WTs occur mostly from late
   November to late April and are characterized by varying intensity and
   location of the North Atlantic subtropical high (NASH) and transient
   synoptic troughs along the northern edge of the domain. Large-scale
   subsidence dominates the whole basin but rainfall can occur over
   sections of the basin, especially on the windward shores of the troughs
   associated with the synoptic waves. The transition between wintertime
   and summertime WTs is rather abrupt, especially in May. One summertime
   WT (WT 4) is prevalent in summer, and almost exclusive around late July.
   It is characterized by strong NASH, fast Caribbean low level jet and
   rainfall mostly concentrated over the Caribbean Islands, the Florida
   Peninsula, the whole Central America and the tropical Eastern Pacific.
   The two remaining summertime WTs display widespread rainfall
   respectively from Central America to Bermuda (WT 5) and over the Eastern
   Caribbean (WT 6). Both WTs combine reduced regional scale subsidence and
   weaker Caribbean low-level jet relatively to WT 4. The relationships
   between WT frequency and El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO) events are
   broadly linear. Warm central and eastern ENSO events are associated with
   more WT 4 (less WT 5-6) during boreal summer and autumn (0) while this
   relationship is reversed during boreal summer (+1) for central events
   only. In boreal winter, the largest anomalies are observed for two WTs
   consistent with negative (WT 2) and positive (WT 8) phases of the North
   Atlantic Oscillation; more (less) WT 2 and less (more) WT 8 than usually
   occur from January to early April during warm (cold) ENSO events, the
   strongest anomalies being recorded during eastern events. Multinomial
   logistic regression is used to hindcast the 11-day low-pass filtered
   occurrence of WTs from local (Caribbean Sea and Gulf of Mexico) and
   remote (Eastern and Central Tropical Pacific) sea surface temperatures
   (SSTs). In boreal summer, the interannual variability of the seasonal
   occurrence of WTs 4-6 is well hindcast when at least the Caribbean Sea
   and Eastern Tropical Pacific are included as predictors with anomalously
   warm (cold) SSTs over the Caribbean Sea (Eastern Tropical Pacific) being
   related to more WT 5-6 and less WT 4 and vice-versa. Using antecedent
   SST to forecast WT frequency shows that the SST forcing is negligible at
   the start of boreal summer and increases toward its end.

   g S m(-2) yr(-1) are estimated for large regions in Asia, with values as
   high as 10 g S m(-2) yr(-1) in southeastern China. Annual averaged SO2
   concentrations in excess of 20 mug SO2 m(-3) are calculated for many
   urban and suburban areas of eastern China and S. Korea, with an average
   of 5 mug SO2 m(-3) over most of the emitter regions. Sulfur deposition
   by major source categories is also studied. Southeast Asia (Indonesia,
   Malaysia, Philippines, Singapore) receives similar to 25% of its sulfur
   deposition from shipping activities. Sulfur deposition from bio-fuel
   burning is significant for most of the underdeveloped regions in Asia.
   Volcanoes are a major source of sulfur emissions in the Pacific Ocean,
   Papua New Guinea, Philippines and Southern Japan. Sulfur deposition is
   shown to vary significantly throughout the year. The monsoons are found
   to be the largest factor controlling sulfur transport and deposition in
   the Indian sub-continent and Southeast Asia. India receives over 35% of
   its total deposition during the summer months. In East Asia, sulfur
   deposition is estimated to be 10% higher during summer and fall than
   winter and spring. Model results are compared with observations from a
   number of monitoring networks in Asia and are found to be generally
   consistent with the limited observations.

AB Networks of no-take marine protected areas (MPAs) have been widely
   advocated for the conservation of marine biodiversity. But for MPA
   networks to be successful in protecting marine populations, individual
   MPAs must be self-sustaining or adequately connected to other MPAs via
   dispersal. For marine species with a dispersive larval stage,
   populations within MPAs require either the return of settlement-stage
   larvae to their natal reserve or connectivity among reserves at the
   spatial scales at which MPA networks are implemented. To date, larvae
   have not been tracked when dispersing from one MPA to another, and the
   relative magnitude of local retention and connectivity among MPAs
   remains unknown. Here we use DNA parentage analysis to provide the first
   direct estimates of connectivity of a marine fish, the orange clownfish
   (Amphiprion percula), in a proposed network of marine reserves in Kimbe
   Bay, Papua New Guinea. Approximately 40% of A. percula larvae settling
   into anemones in an island MPA at 2 different times were derived from
   parents resident in the reserve. We also located juveniles spawned by
   Kimbe Island residents that had dispersed as far as 35 km to other
   proposed MPAs, the longest distance that marine larvae have been
   directly tracked. These dispersers accounted for up to 10% of the
   recruitment in the adjacent MPAs. Our findings suggest that MPA networks
   can function to sustain resident populations both by local replenishment
   and through larval dispersal from other reserves. More generally, DNA
   parentage analysis provides a direct method for measuring larval
   dispersal for other marine organisms.

AB Toxicity identification evaluations (TIEs) were performed on seven
   produced water (PW) effluents from inland discharge facilities operated
   in Trinidad and Tobago, a Caribbean tropical country with one of the
   oldest commercial oil industries in the world. The research was
   performed to determine the presence and magnitude of toxicity and
   characterize which toxicants are responsible for observed effects.
   Marine effluent toxicity characterizations with Metamysidopsis insularis
   revealed high whole acute toxic-unit response for produced water ranged
   from 8.1 to > 17.0 acute toxic-unit (initial toxicity test) and 5.7 to
   1, 111 acute toxic-unit (baseline toxicity test). Toxicity test results
   for all sites except one, which had the highest toxicity, are
   comparative with similar studies on produced water. The toxicological
   causality of this complex mixture differed for each PW with nonpolar
   organics being consistently toxic in all samples. Other potential
   toxicants contributing to overall toxicity to a much lesser extent were
   metals, ammonia, and volatile organic compounds. With the use of sodium
   thiosulfate and filtration manipulations for only PW6 sample, there was
   very slight reduction in toxicity; therefore, oxidants and filterable
   materials were not a great contributing factor. Whole effluent toxicity
   also can be attributed to ionic imbalance and the very stable
   oil-in-water emulsion that consists of fine oil droplets (less than
   0.1-10 mum with an average diameter of 2.5 mum). This investigation is
   the first of its type in Trinidad and demonstrates clearly the
   applicability of this test method and local test species for evaluating
   complex effluents in tropical environments.

AB The most important populations of the spiny lobster (Panulirus argus
   (Latreille, 1804)) in the Atlantic are found in the Caribbean and along
   the Brazilian coast. Field studies covering the waters off the Cuban
   archipelago and Brazil have improved our understanding of the importance
   of oceanic circulation to larval recruitment. South of Cuba, puerulus
   settlement is intensive in October and November when the coastal reefs
   (83 degrees W) are impacted by a cyclone-anticyclone pair, suggesting
   this area is the main source of retention and supply of surviving
   larvae, thus of self-recruitment. On the continental shelf of Brazil,
   puerulus settlement takes place throughout the year, but two annual
   peaks have been identified: one in March-April and one in
   July-September, when retroflection eddies of the North Brazil Current
   are more intense and feed into the eastward-flowing North Equatorial
   Countercurrent. Conceivably, Brazilian spiny lobster larvae are trapped
   in this oceanic system, leading to self-recruitment. On the continental
   shelf of Brazil the larval period lasts 6-7 months, depending on the
   season and spawning date. In the Caribbean the period is reported to be
   6-8 months. Information on the relative abundance of early-stage spiny
   lobster larvae makes it possible to predict patterns of recruitment of
   pueruli and juveniles and the timing of their life cycle. However,
   further research on seasonal variations in local currents, current
   retroflection and ring formation is needed to clarify important aspects
   of larval transport, puerulus settlement and recruitment.

AB In the past decade, international development practitioners have
   increasingly argued that migration improves the food security of
   households at origin, by providing the capital necessary for
   agricultural intensification or food purchase. These debates have
   occurred largely in isolation from a discussion of the values that
   underpin food production and consumption in the communities that
   migrants call home. We question the assumption that a shift from an
   agricultural-based economy to an economy based on remittances increases
   the ability of communities to secure access to food in the face of rapid
   economic and cultural change. In this paper, we present two
   independently conducted studies from Nepal and Vanuatu that investigate
   the impact of out-migration on local perceptions of agricultural and
   residential land and the meaning given to food security. Our data reveal
   that the value changes associated with large-scale out-migration have
   the potential to make the agricultural sector at origin more vulnerable,
   unproductive, unsustainable or unattractive, leaving a longer-term
   impact on food security. We offer some reflections on the implications
   of these findings for the structure of the migration-food security
   nexus.

AB The tourism sector's demand for food, and the distance some food
   travels, has significant impacts on greenhouse gas emissions and
   implications for climate change, especially in long haul small island
   state destinations. This paper describes the development of the concept
   of food miles, and the many measurement issues involved. It analyses a
   small island ecotourism project in Fiji where the source, and transport
   mode, of all food consumed over 35 months was recorded in detail, during
   which time conscious efforts were made to minimise imported foods and
   increase island-grown food. In 2008, the share of imported "non-Fiji"
   food was 18%, by 2010 it was reduced to 5%. On-site production had risen
   from zero to 15%. Off-island, but Fijian, food accounted for the
   balance. Food miles were reduced by over 50%; carbon emissions from food
   transport fell by over 20%. Some problems were encountered by the
   largely young (average age 27 years), largely UK/US visitors who were
   unused to "low carbon" diets with reduced meat levels. Ideas are put
   forward to overcome that challenge, including new/fashionable cooking
   techniques, and interpreting local food and farming to visitors.
   Management issues involved in larger scale ventures are outlined.

AB Low-lying islands in the Pacific, such as atolls, are observing
   increased groundwater salinity, attributed to the impact of climate
   change, which is affecting the production of giant swamp taro
   (Cyrtosperma merkusii). Giant swamp taro has been cultivated
   successfully in the atolls providing food and nutritional security for
   atoll communities. In addition, this unique crop has high cultural
   status. Despite the importance of this crop to the atoll communities and
   the Pacific in general very little research has been carried out on this
   species. Little is known about the extent of diversity and any
   variability in salinity tolerance that might exist. To better understand
   whether or not salinity tolerance exists within the genepool of swamp
   taro and the extent to which it might vary, a rapid screening method is
   needed. This paper reports on the diversity in the Pacific with specific
   reference to the island of Tuvalu. It also describes an in vitro
   screening method, which assesses the impact of salinity levels of 0,
   0.5, 1.5 and 2% salt on two cultivars from Kiribati, 'Ika raoi' (larger
   cultivar) and the 'Katutu' (smaller cultivar). Two approaches are
   discussed, one in which "saltwater" is applied on an increment basis to
   avoid shock to the plant, and to mimic, as much as possible, inundation;
   the other incorporates the salt directly into the culture medium. The
   criteria for monitoring the experiment include biomass measurements and
   visual toxicity responses. Plants showed high tolerance to salinity in
   the first four weeks of the experiment but exhibited slight toxicity
   from the fifth week.

AB The international community directs significant funding towards Pacific
   Small Island Developing States (PSIDS) for climate change allowing
   ambitious target setting. The Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC)
   of Fiji targets 81% of renewable energy share in grid electricity supply
   by 2020 and 100% by 2030. A model is developed to determine possible
   energy transitions to achieve those targets. The model uses installed
   capacities, capacity factors and electricity generated for each
   technology and calculates direct CO2 emissions, the Global Warming
   Potential and the Levelised Cost of Electricity. Eight energy mixes were
   assessed for electricity supply adequacy and the ability to achieve the
   NDC. The results demonstrate few realistic energy future options; a sole
   focus just on renewable energy generation is unlikely to be successful.
   Specifically, meeting the 2020 and 2030 NDC targets would require the
   installation of significant new renewable energy capacity accompanied by
   phasing out of fossil fuel plants, addition of baseload technology (e.g.
   geothermal, Ocean Thermal Energy Conversion), technological improvements
   (e.g. capacity factor) and minimizing electricity demand through energy
   savings and efficiency. All those determinants mean that there is a
   vital need for improved energy modelling and strategic planning, if NDCs
   are to be achieved in Fiji and other PSIDS.

AB The sponge-loop hypothesis proposes that coral reef sponges convert the
   dissolved organic matter (DOM) released by benthic primary producers
   into particulate detritus available to higher trophic levels. The
   hypothesis was developed and subsequently supported from studies of
   cryptic, encrusting sponges; however, the sponge-loop has yet to be
   considered for massive, emergent sponge species that dominate the
   surface of Caribbean reefs and represent a large proportion of sponge
   community biomass. We tested the generality of the sponge-loop for
   emergent sponge fauna by using direct In-Ex methods combined with
   acoustic Doppler velocimetry and sponge volume calculations to quantify
   carbon flux for 9 sponge species representing a variety of functional
   types. The diet of 5 species hosting abundant symbiotic microbes (HMA)
   primarily consisted of dissolved organic car bon (DOC), while 4 species
   with low microbial abundances (LMA) primarily consumed detritus and
   pico-plankton. None of the sponge species studied were found to produce
   significant quantities of detritus. We conclude that, instead of
   releasing assimilated carbon in the form of detritus, as originally
   proposed by the sponge-loop for encrusting, cryptic sponges, emergent
   sponge species likely retain assimilated carbon as biomass. Given the
   high rates of DOC uptake observed for HMA species, we propose an
   additional pathway by which the sponge-loop fuels higher trophic levels
   via predation by fish, turtle, and invertebrate spongivores.

AB In many of the lesser developed areas of the world, regional development
   planning is increasingly important for meeting the needs of current and
   future inhabitants. Expansion of economic capability, infrastructure,
   and residential capacity requires significant investment, and so efforts
   to limit the negative effect of landslides and other natural hazards on
   these investments are crucial. Many of the newer approaches to
   identifying and mapping relative landslide susceptibility within a
   developing area are hindered by insufficient data in the places where it
   is most needed. An approach called matrix assessment was specifically
   designed for regional development planning where data may be limited.
   Its application produces a landslide-susceptibility map suitable for use
   with other planning data in a Geographical Information System (GIS)
   environment. Its development also encourages collecting basic landslide
   inventory data suitable for site-specific studies and for refining
   landslide hazard assessments in the future. This paper illustrates how
   matrix assessment methodology was applied to produce a
   landslide-susceptibility map for the Commonwealth of Dominica, an island
   nation in the eastern Caribbean, and how with a follow up study the
   relative landslide-susceptibility mapping was validated. A second
   Caribbean application on Jamaica demonstrates how this methodology can
   be applied in a more geologically complex setting. A validated approach
   to mapping landslide susceptibility which does not require extensive
   input data offers a significant benefit to planning in lesser developed
   parts of the world.

   species belongs to the Donsiellinae Lang, 1944, a highly specialised
   taxon, the members of which have previously been encountered only in
   association with decaying wood and/or wood-boring isopods. A closer
   relationship of the Donsiellinae with the Pseudotachidiidae Lang, 1936,
   can be stated on the basis of characteristics concerning the setation
   and/or segmentation of A1, A2, Mxl, Mxp, the shape of the female P5,
   anal somite, sexual dimorphisms on P2 and P3 and missing caudal seta I.
   Within the Pseudotachidiidae, the Donsiellinae again can be well
   characterized, e.g. by the setation and segmentation of A2, Mxl,
   swimming-legs, the shape of P1, female P5, male P2, sexual dimorphism
   and male P5. The Donsiellinae share some apomorphies with the
   pseudotachidiid subtaxon Paranannopinae Por, 1986: setation/segmentation
   of Mx, P1, A1. X. calyptogenae spec. n. is more closely related to
   Xylora bathyalis Hicks 1988 living in the deep sea wood substrata in New
   Zealand waters. Some traits of the evolutionary history of the
   Donsiellinae become evident, probably starting from the more primitive
   deep sea taxa X .calyptogenae spec. n., which lives in the hydrothermal
   seafloor in the absence of decaying wood, and X. bathyalis, which is
   found in decaying wood but not necessarily associated with the
   wood-boring isopod Limnoria Leach, 1814, towards the more advanced
   genera such as Donsiella Stephensen, 1936, which invades shallow waters
   and, further, clings to Limnoria, forming a close and, for the copepod,
   probably obligatory association. The specialised mouthparts of X.
   calyptogenae spec. n. seem to facilitate the grabbing and fixing of
   larger and/or active food items. This is confirmed by the presence of a
   large prey organism, presumably a copepod, consumed either alive or
   dead, in the gut of one of the available specimens. This morphology of
   the mouthparts is also shared by the closely related X. bathyalis.

AB Fisheries resources are of particular importance to the small island
   developing states of the Eastern Caribbean. There is an increasing
   demand for seafood to address food security and nutrition, to support
   coastal livelihoods and to contribute to sustainable development. The
   Caribbean Community recently developed a Regional Food and Nutrition
   Security Policy and a Common Fisheries Policy. These instruments,
   however, only make passing mention of fisheries and food security,
   respectively. There is little evidence of food security being integrated
   into fisheries governance. Yet, recent research has shown that
   resilience perspectives on fisheries governance in the Eastern Caribbean
   can be useful for obtaining ecosystem services, such as those that
   relate to food security, from social-ecological systems. This resilience
   takes into account global and regional environmental change, multiple
   levels of governance and degrees of adaptive capacity, matching the
   scales of social and ecological processes and managing social networks
   in the institutional arrangements for resource use and conservation.
   Building food security and resilience into fisheries governance requires
   the development of adaptive capacity, especially through social
   networks, and with an emphasis on policies that enable fisherfolk
   self-organisation.

AB Population outbreaks of crown-of-thorns sea star (Acanthaster planci L)
   remain one of the most significant biological disturbances on tropical
   coral reefs although the increasing attention given to other threats has
   greatly limited recent progress in understanding the cause and
   consequences of this phenomenon. In September 2005 dramatic increases in
   the abundance of A. planci were observed on reefs within Bootless Bay,
   Central Province, Papua New Guinea, where few crown-of-thorns have
   previously been reported. Densities of A. planci peaked at 162 sea stars
   per hectare and caused extensive coral mortality. This outbreak killed
   upwards of 55% of live corals, reducing overall coral cover from 42.4%
   in 2005 down to just 19.1% in March 2006. Declines in coral cover were
   largely driven by widespread mortality of Acropora spp. which dominated
   reef assemblages prior to the outbreak. The extensive depletion of
   Acropora spp. greatly altered the coral composition as well as the
   physical structure of reef habitats. In the absence of any other major
   disturbances these coral communities are likely to quickly recover, but
   this Outbreak highlights the ongoing contribution of A. planci to
   degradation of coral reef environments. Crown Copyright (C) 2009

AB Changes in oceanic radiocarbon (C-14) reservoir ages through the
   deglaciation and Holocene can provide important information on ocean
   circulation as Earth's climate warmed. Here, we present reservoir ages
   for the western tropical Pacific that span the mid-Holocene transition
   from less to more frequent El Nino events. Reservoir ages were
   calculated using paired U-Th and conventional C-14 dating of eight
   individual fossil coral samples from Koil and Muschu Islands, northern
   coastal Papua New Guinea (PNG). AMS C-14 and MC-ICPMS U-Th dating of
   additional samples from six of the fossil corals were used to confirm
   the TIMS U-Th and conventional C-14 ages. The combined results show
   average reservoir ages of 185 +/- 30 C-14 yr (n = 4) for 7220-5850 yr BP
   compared to 420 C-14 yr for a modern coral from Muschu Island. From 5850
   to 5420 yr BP reservoir ages increase to modern values. The relatively
   young reservoir ages from 7220 to 5850 yr BP are best explained by
   greater influx of well-equilibrated sub-tropical water from the southern
   branch of the South Equatorial Current (SEC). This is consistent with
   strengthening trade winds (facilitating air-sea exchange) and a more
   northerly position of the Intertropical Convergence Zone thought to have
   occurred at this time. The transition to more modern-like reservoir ages
   from 5850 to 5420 yr BP suggests modern oceanic circulation patterns
   were established during this interval. The onset of modern El Nino
   activity around this time would have served to enhance the intrusion of
   C-14-depleted equatorial waters via the south equatorial branch of the
   SEC. Overall, the changes in reservoir age presented here for the
   western tropical Pacific suggest that Holocene changes in the El
   Nino-Southern Oscillation state of the tropical Pacific resulted in
   reorganisation of oceanic circulation in this region. Crown Copyright

AB Dinoflagellates in the genus Gambierdiscus produce toxins that
   bioaccumulate in tropical and sub-tropical fishes causing ciguatera fish
   poisoning (CFP). Little is known about the diversity and distribution of
   Gambierdiscus species, the degree to which individual species vary in
   toxicity, and the role each plays in causing CFP. This paper presents
   the first global distribution of Gambierdiscus species. Phylogenetic
   analyses of the existing isolates indicate that five species are endemic
   to the Atlantic (including the Caribbean/West Indies and Gulf of
   Mexico), five are endemic to the tropical Pacific, and that two species.
   Gambierdiscus carpenteri and Gambierdiscus caribaeus are globally
   distributed. The differences in Gambierdiscus species composition in the
   Atlantic and Pacific correlated with structural differences in the
   ciguatoxins reported from Atlantic and Pacific fish. This correlation
   supports the hypothesis that Gambierdiscus species in each region
   produce different toxin suites. A literature survey indicated a
   >100-fold variation in toxicity among species compared with a 2 to
   9-fold within species variation due to changing growth conditions. These
   observations suggest that CFP events are driven more by inherent
   differences in species toxicity than by environmental modulation. How
   variations in species toxicity may affect the development of an early
   warning system for CFP is discussed. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Costal ecosystems like coral barrier reefs and mangrove forests have
   been designated as environments in need of protection. This is not only
   because they are threatened by climate change, but also because of the
   important role they play in coastal protection. Some field studies based
   on Rhizophora mangrove trees have analyzed the force induced by water
   flow over their roots and the wave dissipation capacity of these trees
   under tidal regimes and sea waves. Various methods have been used to
   calculate energy dissipation in the past, but these do not include the
   drag coefficient (C-D) with field data calibration. The study presented
   here was conducted to investigate the capacity of a small natural
   Rhizophora mangrove patch (at experimental scale) located on Isla Grande
   in the Colombian Caribbean Sea to mitigate wave energy. The total energy
   dissipation, including the slope bottom and the effects of vegetation,
   was calculated. Parametric equations were used to calculate the effects
   of vegetation. The drag force (F-D) was computed using Morrison's
   equation and the C-D was calculated using Mazda's method. The results
   show a mean energy dissipation difference of 9.6% between the energy
   balance and dissipation coefficients wherethe C-D was calculated for
   each sea state. The dissipation coefficients were calculated with
   constant C-D values (0.06, 3.48 and 6.90). None of the three cases could
   explain the 90.4% energy flux, as in the case of vegetation dissipation
   (D-veg) with calculated and non-constant C-D values. Despite the small
   size of the mangrove patch, the results show an increase in the C-D
   (with values of up to 7.9) as a result of lower values of the Reynolds
   number (R-e) (about 7.3 x 10(5)). This demonstrates experimentally the
   role that even a small patch of mangrove vegetation plays in attenuating
   sea waves (as C-D is a function of sea states), and higher magnitudes
   were obtained than those recorded in the literature using other
   vegetation types. A nonlinear contribution to energy flow by bottom
   dissipation and vegetation dissipation was observed. Our results
   highlight the need to scale measurements up to forest level in order to
   accurately quantify the impact of mangrove vegetation on wave
   attenuation and determine the possible impact on the protection of
   coastal ecosystems and infrastructure. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights

AB Recently it has been estimated that one third of biodiversity threats
   are driven by consumer demand from outside the country in which the
   threat occurs. This occurs when the production of export goods exerts
   pressure on vulnerable populations. While population biologists have in
   cases been able to establish links between species threats and the
   causative industry(s), little has been done to trace this biodiversity
   footprint from the directly implicated industry out to final consumers,
   a step that would open a wider variety of policy responses. Here we
   investigate the suitability of multi-region input-output (MRIO) analysis
   for tracing out links between particular species threats, directly
   implicated industries, and the countries and consumer goods sectors
   ultimately driving these industries. Environmentally extended MRIO
   models are understood to provide reliable results at a macroeconomic
   level but uncertainty increases as the models are used to investigate
   individual sectors, companies, and products. In this study we examine
   several case studies (nickel mining in New Caledonia, coltan from the
   Democratic Republic of Congo, cut flowers from Kenya, and forestry in
   Papua New Guinea) in order to understand how and when MRIO techniques
   can be useful for studying biodiversity implicated supply chains. The
   study was conducted using the Eora global input-output database that
   documents >5 billion global supply chains. Calculating the biodiversity
   footprint at this level of detail, between specific threats, supply
   chains, and consumer goods, has not been done before. These case studies
   provide interesting insights in their own right and also serve to
   highlight the strengths and weaknesses of using input-output analysis
   techniques to calculate detailed biodiversity footprints. We conclude
   that MRIO analysis, while no panacea, can be useful for outlining supply
   chains and identifying which consumption sectors and trade and
   transformation steps can be subjected to closer analysis in order to
   enable remedial action. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Regional Fisheries Management Organizations (RFMOs) addressing the
   management of living marine resources have a long history, beginning in
   1811 with the North Pacific Fur Seal Convention followed by the
   International Pacific Halibut Convention in 1924. Following the
   expansion of fisheries after WWII, RFMOs proliferated and after the
   general acceptance of a 200 mile extended jurisdiction in the mid- 1970s
   many more nations became involved. There are approximately 17 RFMOs
   (depending on the definition of "management") of the over 40 marine
   Regional Fisheries Bodies (RFBs) identified by the Food and Agriculture
   Organization (FAO) of the United Nations. The Large Marine Ecosystem
   (LME) approach has roots in the experience of the International
   Commission for the Conservation of Northwest Atlantic Fisheries (now
   defunct and replaced by the Northwest Atlantic Fisheries Organization
   (NAFO)) which pioneered ecosystem based fisheries management. The LME
   approach to the assessment of coastal ocean goods and services was
   included in the operational guidelines for project proposals by the
   International Waters Focal Area of the Global Environmental Facility
   (GEF) in 1995. LMEs have fisheries as one of five major components to be
   addressed under the modular assessment and management framework for LME
   project development. As LME Programs enter the stage where they need to
   move to develop their governance responsibilities, the relationship with
   existing RFMOs is critical. This paper examines possibilities for this
   interaction with special attention to Latin American and Caribbean LMEs
   particularly in relation to their three northeastern LMEs. Possible
   inferences from the experiences of the coastal states of the US are also
   addressed, considering the Gulf and Atlantic States Marine Fisheries
   Commissions as a pseudo RFMO with the states assuming a role similar to
   countries.

AB Papua New Guinea clayey soils are stabilized with various percentages of
   volcanic ash (VA), finely ground natural lime (L), cement and their
   combinations. The influence of stabilizers and their combinations is
   evaluated through Atterberg limits, standard Proctor compaction,
   unconfined compressive strength, splitting tensile strength, modulus of
   elasticity and California bearing ratio (CBR) tests. The durability of
   38 stabilized soil mixtures is also conducted by studying the influence
   of water immersion on strength, water sorptivity and drying shrinkage.
   Correlations between compressive strength, modulus of elasticity and CBR
   are also established. Theoretical analysis of pavements incorporating
   subgrades improved by stabilized soils under traffic loads shows
   technical benefits compared with conventional flexible pavements without
   improved subgrades. Suitable stabilized soil mixtures using VA, L,
   cement and their combinations are proposed which can be used for the
   construction of road pavements, airfields, earth dams and low-cost
   housing. The use of locally available soils, VA and lime in the
   production of stabilized soils for such applications can provide
   sustainability for the local construction industry. (C) 2007 Elsevier

AB We present the results of an intensive sampling program carried out from
   2000 to 2007 along both coasts of Costa Rica, Central America. The
   presence of 44 species of benthic marine algae is reported for the first
   time for Costa Rica. Most of the new records are Rhodophyta (27 spp.),
   followed by Chlorophyta (15 spp.), and Heterokontophyta, Phaeophycea (2
   spp.). Overall, the currently known marine flora of Costa Rica is
   comprised of 446 benthic marine algae and 24 Cyanobacteria. This species
   number is an under estimation, and will increase when species of benthic
   marine algae from taxonomic groups where only limited information is
   available (e.g., microfilamentous benthic marine algae, Cyanobacteria)
   are included. The Caribbean coast harbors considerably more benthic
   marine algae (318 spp.) than the Pacific coast (190 spp.); such a trend
   has been observed in all neighboring countries. Compared to other
   Central American countries, Costa Rica has the highest number of
   reported benthic marine algae; however, Panama may have a similarly high
   diversity after unpublished results from a Rhodophyta survey (Wysor,
   unpublished) are included. Sixty-two species have been found along both
   the Pacific and Caribbean coasts of Costa Rica; we discuss this result
   in relation to the emergence of the Central American Isthmus.

AB The parasitoid fraction is defined for a given set of arthropods as the
   number of parasitoid individuals divided by the number of all arthropod
   individuals. The hymenopteran parasitoid fraction was computed for
   arthropods caught in sticky traps on islands at two sites in the
   Bahamas. At Staniel, twenty islands were cross-classified by area
   (large, small) and distance (near, far). At Abaco, twenty-one islands
   were cross-classified by area (large, small) and lizard treatment
   (lizards occurring naturally and unmanipulated, lizards not occurring
   naturally but experimentally introduced, lizards not occurring naturally
   and unmanipulated). The parasitoid fraction was larger for large islands
   and larger for near islands wherever this could be tested. Range of
   variation was especially great at Staniel, from 0.13 (small-far) to 0.48
   (large-near). Absolute number of parasitoids, the numerator of the
   parasitoid fraction, was larger for large islands at Abaco but not at
   Staniel; however, it was somewhat larger for near islands at Staniel. At
   Abaco, parasitoid fractions and absolute numbers were highest overall
   for islands having lizards naturally and lowest for islands not having
   lizards naturally; lizard-introduction islands were intermediate. A
   relative-attenuation hypothesis, in which parasitoids and other
   arthropods both diminish with decreasing immigration or increasing
   extinction but the former does so relatively more strongly, is partly
   supported by the Staniel distance and Abaco area data.
   Food-web-interaction hypotheses may explain the other results: a
   differential reduction of other arthropods compared to parasitoids on
   large islands fits the Staniel area data, and a negative effect of
   lizards on parasitoid predators fits the Abaco treatment data. However,
   a tendency for islands favorable for lizards to be favorable for
   parasitoids seems at least an equally plausible explanation for the
   latter result.

   report, total mercury concentrations had been documented only for

   fish size had not been evaluated. In the Florida Keys, total mercury
   concentrations in dorsal muscle tissue from 107 lionfish ranged from
   0.03 to 0.48 ppm, with all concentrations being less than the regulatory
   threshold for limited consumption. Mercury concentrations did not vary
   consistently with standard lengths or wet weights of lionfish. In 2010,
   lionfish from the upper Keys had mean concentrations that were 0.03-0.04
   ppm higher than lionfish from the middle Keys, but mean concentrations
   did not differ consistently among years and locations. Overall, total
   mercury concentrations in lionfish were lower than those in several
   predatory fishes that support commercial and recreational fisheries in
   Florida. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Fallout from atmospheric nuclear tests, especially from those conducted
   at the Pacific Proving Grounds between 1946 and 1958, contaminated areas
   of the Northern Marshall Islands, A radiological survey at some Northern
   Marshall Islands was conducted from September through November 1978 to
   evaluate the extent of residual radioactive contamination, The atolls
   included in the Northern Marshall Islands Radiological Survey (NMIRS)
   were Likiep, Ailuk, Utirik, Wotho, Ujelang, Taka, Rongelap, Rongerik,
   Bikar, Ailinginae, and Mejit and Jemo Islands, The original test sites,
   Bikini and Enewetak Atolls, were also visited on the survey, An aerial
   survey was conducted to determine the external gamma exposure rate,
   Terrestrial (soil, food crops, animals, and native vegetation), cistern
   and well water samples, and marine (sediment, seawater, fish and clams)
   samples were collected to evaluate radionuclide concentrations in the
   atoll environment, Samples were processed and analyzed for Cs-137,
   Sr-90, Pu239+240 and Am-241, The dose from the ingestion pathway was
   calculated using the radionuclide concentration data and a diet model
   for local food, marine, and water consumption, The ingestion pathway
   contributes 70% to 90% of the estimated dose, Approximately 95% of the
   dose is from Cs-137. Sr-90 is the second most significant radionuclide
   via ingestion, External gamma exposure from Cs-137 accounts for about
   10% to 30% of the dose. Pu239+240 and Am-241 are the major contributors
   to dose via the inhalation pathway; however, inhalation accounts for
   only about 1% of the total estimated dose, based on surface soil levels
   and resuspension studies, All doses are computed for concentrations
   decay corrected to 1996, The maximum annual effective dose from manmade
   radionuclides at these atolls ranges from .02 mSv y(-1) to 2.1 mSv
   y(-1). The background dose in the Marshall Islands is estimated to be
   2.4 mSv y(-1). The combined dose from both background and bomb related
   radionuclides ranges from slightly over 2.4 mSv y(-1) to 4.5 mSv y(-1).
   The 50-y integral dose ranges from 0.5 to 65 mSv.

   writers in 1984 and 1986, as well as on all the available bibliographic
   data, a revision of the mosquitoes of the Island of Sao Tome is carried
   out. Considering that, for several reasons, the records of 10 of the
   species previousely published by other authors cannot be validated, we
   recognize the occurrence in the island of a total of 26 species, 3 of
   which now recorded for the first time, including a new species here
   described: Culex (Culex.) annulioris Theobald, 1901, Cx. (Eumelanomyla)
   rima Theobald, 1901 and Cx. (Eum.) micolo sp. nova. 6 out the 26 species
   are endemic to the Island of Sao Tome (23,1 %), while another species
   also occurs in the Island of Principe but not, apparently, in the
   African Continent. Represented by a total of 14 species belonging to 4
   subgenera, genus Culex, appears as being, by far, the dominant mosquito
   genus in the Island of Sao Tome. Under each species, some historical
   remarksare made, the material examined by collecting localities is
   indicated and some notes on the bionomics of its immatures and adults
   are added. After examining the zoogeography of the mosquitoes of Sao
   Tome, the mosquito species biodiversity of the Island is estimated and
   compared to that of other Atlantic Islands and Cameroun, in the
   Continent. Lastly, the medical importance of the mosquitoes of Sao Tome
   is considered as vectors of human and animal pathogens, being shown that
   not only the most potent malaria vector but also some of the most
   important vectors of yellow fever, several other arboviroses and
   lymphatic filariasis are among the most generalized and common species
   in the Island.

AB We present new deep water carbonate ion concentration ([CO32-]) records,
   reconstructed using Cibicidoides wuellerstorfi B/Ca, for one core from
   Caribbean Basin (water depth = 3623 m, sill depth = 1.8 km) and three
   cores located at 2.3-4.3 km water depth from the equatorial Pacific
   Ocean during the Last Glacial interglacial cycle. The pattern of deep
   water [CO32-] in the Caribbean Basin roughly mirrors that of atmospheric
   CO2, reflecting a dominant influence from preformed [CO32-] in the North
   Atlantic Ocean. Compared to the amplitude of similar to 65 mu mol/kg in
   the deep Caribbean Basin, deep water [CO32-] in the equatorial Pacific
   Ocean has varied by no more than similar to 15 mu mol/kg due to
   effective buffering of CaCO3 on deep-sea pH in the Pacific Ocean. Our
   results suggest little change in the global mean deep ocean [CO32-]
   between the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) and the Late Holocene. The three
   records from the Pacific Ocean show long-term increases in [CO32-] by
   similar to 7 mu mol/kg from Marine Isotope Stage (MIS) 5c to mid MIS 3,
   consistent with the response of the deep ocean carbonate system to a
   decline in neritic carbonate production associated with similar to 60 m
   drop in sea-level (the "coral-reef" hypothesis). Superimposed upon the
   long-term trend, deep water [CO32-] in the Pacific Ocean displays
   transient changes, which decouple with delta C-13 in the same cores, at
   the start and end of MIS 4. These changes in [CO32-] and delta C-13 are
   consistent with what would be expected from vertical nutrient
   fractionation and carbonate compensation. The observed similar to 4 mu
   mol/kg [CO32-] decline in the two Pacific cores at >3.4 km water depth
   from MIS 3 to the LGM indicate further strengthening of deep ocean
   stratification, which contributed to the final step of atmospheric CO2
   drawdown during the last glaciation. The striking similarity between
   deep water [CO32-] and Th-230-normalized CaCO3 flux at two adjacent
   sites from the central equatorial Pacific Ocean provides convincing
   evidence that deep-sea carbonate dissolution dominantly controlled CaCO3
   preservation at these sites in the past. Our results offer new and
   quantitative constraints from deep ocean carbonate chemistry to
   understand roles of various mechanisms in atmospheric CO2 changes over
   the Last Glacial interglacial cycle. (c) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

AB This paper explores how the state and others involved in the
   'development enterprise' in Timor-Leste are (mis)recognizing the
   potential of the existing environmental governance and exchange
   capacities of local customary institutions and practices in relation to
   water supply and management. Examining the problematic of water supply
   in a particular place-based instance - more specifically, the intermesh
   of the customary, state and market sectors - it ponders how customary
   institutions might be better supported to extend their range of
   political and economic credibility and contribute to a reconfiguration
   of dominant community managed water supply models. Drawing out the
   workings of a 'diverse economy' where a customary economy is enmeshed
   with, and to some extent undermining, a weak capitalist sector, the
   paper argues that a failure to address issues of resource ownership and
   control and to engage the strengths and import of local customary
   institutions will have serious ramifications for the successful
   implementation of national development objectives in post-conflict
   Baucau city and elsewhere in Timor-Leste. Instead, it argues for an
   enlivened development approach wherein locally socialized landscapes are
   recognized as credible political sites with which 'development' can
   engage and power relations can shift.

   dry wt m(-2) yr(-1)) were within the envelope of expectations for a
   region of high rainfall, great river catchment relief, and rapid
   tectonic uplift of mountains. Copper accumulation rates were enhanced 40
   fold in surface sediments, compared to pre-1950 sections of the sediment
   cores. These recent sediments with enhanced copper concentrations come
   from Freeport Indonesia mine tailings over the last 27 years. Variations
   in sediment core profiles of Al, Fe, and organic carbon were small,
   indicating no great change in bulk sediment composition. Sulfur
   concentrations decline toward the sediment surface, suggesting a decline

AB A worldwide taxonomic and distributional synthesis of the deep-water
   hermit crab genus Oncopagurus Lemaitre, 1996 is presented. This genus,
   originally defined for 10 species is set apart from other Parapaguridae
   as well as other Paguroidea, by one synapomorphy: the presence of an
   upwardly curved epistomial spine. This study is based on a large amount
   of specimens deposited in major museums and collected during deep-sea
   sampling across the world oceans since the late 1800s, with the bulk of
   material coming from French campaigns in the Indo-Pacific, central and
   south Pacific during the last 40 years. A total of 24 species are
   recognised in this investigation, nine of which are new and fully
   described and illustrated. All previously known species are diagnosed or
   re-described, including figures assembled from recent published accounts
   or newly illustrated, of the most important morphological features
   useful for identifications. Information for each species includes a
   synonymy (full or abbreviated if a synonymy has recently been
   published), material examined (type and non-types), variations when
   significant, colouration when available, habitat or type of housing
   used, distribution, and remarks on taxonomy and morphological
   affinities. Rare colour photographs are included for five species.
   Species of Oncopagurus range in depth from the Continental Shelf (50 m)
   to the Continental Rise (2308 m), although they are most commonly found
   in 50-500 m. Individuals of the majority of species in this genus are

   cultivars 3-mun, Carot kaukau, Wahgi besta, Nillgai, Baiyer kaukau, and
   1-mun from three provinces, three farmers, and three locations, were
   subjected to an in vitro starch digestion procedure. Digestion of starch
   was studied by glucometry, while potassium release was monitored using
   electrochemistry. The potassium content of the nondigested samples
   ranged from 4 to 17 mg g-1 dry solids, while the starch content was from
   47 to 80 g per 100 g dry solids and independent of G x E effects. In
   vitro starch digestibility (2-75 g digested starch per 100 g dry starch)
   significantly (P < 0.05) varied with time in a nonlinear manner with
   biphasic digestograms. Potassium release was independent of time in in
   vitro gastric and pancreatic regions, but more potassium was released
   during pancreatic than gastric digestion. Results suggest differences in
   resistant starch and bioavailability of (micro)nutrients that could
   influence utilisation of sweet potato.

AB Stable isotopes (delta C-13, delta N-15, and delta S-34) are used to
   characterize the diet of the adult individuals (n = 99) interred in the
   Namu burial ground located on the Polynesian outlier of Taumako (similar
   to 300-750 BP). Polynesian outliers are islands on the fringe of Remote
   Oceania that were inhabited by a back migration of populations from
   Polynesia during prehistory. As a result of admixture with nearby island
   communities, little is known about the social structure and social
   diversity of the prehistoric inhabitants of Taumako. The distribution of
   prestige grave goods within the Namu cemetery has been used as evidence
   to support the premise that Taumakoan social structure was stratified
   like Polynesian societies. Here we test the hypothesis that "wealthy"
   individuals and males will display isotopic ratios indicative of the
   consumption of "high status" foods in the Pacific islands such as pork,
   chicken, sea turtle, and pelagic fish. The isotope results suggest the
   delta S-34 values were diagenetically altered, possibly an effect of
   volcanism. The carbon and nitrogen stable isotope ratios indicate that
   the diet of all the individuals included a mixture of C-3 terrestrial
   plant foods (likely starchy staples such as yam, taro, and breadfruit,
   in addition to nuts) and a variety of marine resources, including reef
   and pelagic fish. The stable isotope results indicate that wealthy
   individuals and males were eating more foods from higher trophic levels,
   interpreted as being high status animal foods. The socially
   differentiated food consumption patterns are discussed within a Pacific
   island context. (C) 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB Focusing on contemporary shellfish exploitation among several atoll
   communities in Kiribati, Micronesia, this paper examines the
   relationship between human foragers and their invertebrate prey via the
   prey choice or diet breadth model derived from optimal foraging theory.
   Shellfish, like many other reef organisms, are relatively sedentary and
   predictable, but these characteristics make them susceptible to
   over-harvesting. The research reveals that shellfish gatherers are
   foraging in a manner that matches the predictions of optimal foraging
   theory. The work adds to our understanding of optimal foraging decisions
   in atoll settings by critically evaluating the depiction of atoll
   dwellers as conservationists.

AB Polycentricity, a complex form of governance characterized by multiple
   centers of semiautonomous decision-making, has been embraced by commons
   scholars for the governance of complex natural resource systems. In this
   context, several benefits are commonly ascribed to polycentric
   governance systems, including enhanced adaptive capacity, mitigation of
   risk and provision of good institutional fit. We examine the functioning
   of a polycentric governance system through a qualitative case study of
   the governance of small-scale fishing in the Northern Reef region of
   Palau where fishery resources have been declining in recent decades. By
   engaging a theoretical model of a functional polycentric governance
   system, we identify deficiencies in institutional features that partly
   explain why functionality is not fully achieved. Analysis of the
   historical transition of the governance system from community-based to
   polycentric reveals that the path to polycentricity and contextual
   conditions constitute additional distal explanations of deficiencies in
   functionality. The findings suggest that transitioning from
   community-based to polycentric governance risks producing conditions
   conducive to crowding-out and erosion of rule compliance where the form
   of polycentricity assumed entails primarily higher-level government
   decision-makers with insufficient capacity for rule implementation. The
   case underlines the need for more refined theory concerning the
   emergence and functionality of different forms polycentric governance
   systems in various contexts.

AB Examination of sediment samples from oligo-and dystrophic ponds, lakes

   hitherto unknown diversity of the diatom genus Actinella Lewis. Six new
   species are proposed, viz. Actinella aotearoaia sp. nov., A. giluwensis
   sp. nov., A indistincta sp. nov., A. muylaertii sp, nov., A. parva sp.
   nov. and A. pulchella sp. nov. All species are heteropolar, both in
   girdle and valve view. Novel information on the genus Actinella includes
   the observations of two ribbon-shaped. valve-appressed plastids in A.
   aotearoaia and A. pulchella, and the presence of long mucilage stalks in
   A. aotearoaia. It is argued that, despite recent proposals to reduce the
   genera Actinella and Desmogonium Ehrenberg to the rank of subgenera of
   Eunotia, they should be kept separate until the taxonomic significance
   of their distinctive morphological features (such as heteropolarity) is
   fully assessed. The new species appear to be endemic to Australasia and
   have distinct biogeographies within this region. Except for A,
   aotearoaia, all species are present in Tasmania. A. indistincta and A.
   pulchella have also been found in New Zealand (Stewart Island). A.
   aotearoaia is common in several localities in New Zealand but was also
   found near Sydney on the Australian mainland. Actinella giluwensis has
   only been observed in material from Papua New Guinea. The record of A.
   punctata for the latter country constitutes the first confirmed record
   for this species outside North America and Europe. The discovery of the
   new Actinella species again confirms the importance of the Australasian
   region as a major centre of microalgal biodiversity and endemism.

AB In the Discovery Bay area of north Jamaica, a Pleistocene fringing reef
   grew and was subsequently planed off as sea level rose to and fell from
   a highstand approximately 5 to 10 m below modern sea level between
   132,000 and 147,000 yrs BP. Dynamic movement of seawater through the
   reef today, evidenced by flow of water in and out of open core holes,
   has caused precipitation of cements which overprint previous diagenetic
   fabrics in certain zones. In the reef-flat and distal fore-reef facies,
   where porosity is diffuse, modern water movement is slow and has had
   little effect on pre-existing diagenetic fabrics, which are dominantly
   vadose in texture. In facies with conduit porosity, as in the reef crest
   and proximal portions of the shallow fore-reef, seawater is channelized
   and high flow rates have resulted in the precipitation of substantial
   amounts of Holocene sparry, high-magnesian calcite cements (15-18 mol%
   MgCO3) up to 250-mu-m thick. resulting in. incorporation of significant
   amounts of C-14 in the Pleistocene rocks. Smaller Mg-calcite crystals,
   having lower magnesium content. are characteristic of zones with diffuse
   porosity. The dynamic marine system apparently also favors the
   precipitation of dolomite.
   In zones of diffuse porosity, water motion within the reef results in
   the slow movement out of the man-made conduits. In zones of conduit
   porosity, such as in facies having highly localized permeability. water
   is sucked into open core holes in accordance with Bernoulli's Principle.
   It is not known to what depths such channelized flow occurs. Data from a
   recording current meter demonstrate that the driving force responsible
   for the dynamic hydrology has a strong tidal component. The tidal
   component is augmented by wind-driven waves and is probably superimposed
   on another, unidentified, current which contributes to the flow of water
   in the reef at all tidal stages.

   have been associated with infections by trematodes, turbellarians, and
   protozoans (Cryptocaryon). In order to compare rates of infection across

   communities along 40 m(2) belt transects in Belize (n = 35), Cura double
   dagger ao (n = 82), and Mexico (n = 80) over a 4-week period. Three

   in Cura double dagger ao were surgeonfishes (Acanthuridae). There was no
   correlation between incidence of infection and species abundance (r (2)
   = 0.03), or with functional traits (diet, mobility, schooling behavior,
   or position in the water column). The causes of the strikingly high
   incidence of dermal parasites in Cura double dagger ao and its
   consequences remain unknown. However, considering that parasites with
   complex life cycles have several hosts throughout their lives, and that
   past disease outbreaks have had severe consequences on communities of
   the Caribbean, we caution that coral reef ecosystems of Cura double
   dagger ao should be closely monitored.

   highest fat content. Neutral (storage) lipid was significantly higher in

AB Foraminifera attached permanently to hard substrates have received
   relatively little research attention in distributional studies compared
   to free-living specimens. Because attached (encrusting) species are
   commonly found on hard substrata, such as coral rubble, and they are
   sensitive to environmental variables controlled by water depth and
   distance from shore, these species can be useful in paleoecologic
   research. This study examined the distribution of encrusting
   foraminifera found at the outer Bahamian island of San Salvador to
   describe onshore-to-offshore zonation and to characterize foraminiferal
   assemblages found in different reef types. Cobbles were collected along
   two transects on the leeward side of the island and at numerous
   locations on the windward side, including a bank barrier reef and the
   eastern platform edge. Encrusting foraminifera found on the undersides
   of cobbles were quantified and identified by taxa, morphotype, and
   taphonomic grade. Significant differences were found in the distribution
   of encrusting foraminiferal species across the carbonate platform, based
   on both counts of individuals and area of substrate covered. The
   zonation was particularly evident between platform-top and
   platform-margin assemblages. Nearshore assemblages were dominated by
   well-preserved Homotrema rubrum. Patch reefs, especially those found
   further from shore, were characterized by a relatively diverse
   assemblage with prominent Planorbulina spp. whereas bank barrier reefs
   were dominated by H. rubrum, often with Gypsina plana. Platform-margin
   assemblages were the most distinct because they were dominated by large,
   sheet-like G. plana, with other taxa being small, sparse, and poorly
   preserved.

AB A strong lagged relationship between El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO)
   and rainfall in the main rain season (October-January) Oil the leeward
   islands of Aruba, Curacao and Bonaire is found. It can easily be used
   for skilful seasonal predictions, with an anomaly correlation
   coefficient r approximate to 0.6 at lag 4 months on historical data. The
   other two seasons, February-May and June-September, also show
   correlations with ENSO that can be exploited for predictions, r = 0.4 to
   0.5. In the February-May dry season there is also a lagged correlation
   with sea-surface temperature (SST) in the Pacific Ocean off the Central
   American coast that can be used to increase the forecast skill. A
   June-September small rains season correlation to equatorial Atlantic
   Ocean SST is absent in earlier data. Most of these results are also
   applicable to other stations in northern South America. Regressions with
   the circulation show that the main intermediate factors are Upper-level
   divergence and vorticity, and at lower levels a veering of the trade
   winds. This modifies the descending limb of the sea-continent breeze
   circulation that is responsible for the dry zone off the coast.

AB The productivity and biomass of pristine coral reef ecosystems is poorly
   understood, particularly in the Caribbean where communities have been
   impacted by overfishing and multiple other stressors over centuries.
   Using historical data on the spatial distribution and abundance of the
   extinct Caribbean monk seal (Monachus tropicalis), this study
   reconstructs the population size, structure and ecological role of this
   once common predator within coral reef communities, and provides
   evidence that historical reefs supported biomasses of fishes and
   invertebrates up to six times greater than those found on typical modern
   Caribbean reefs. An estimated 233 000-338 000 monk seals were
   distributed among 13 colonies across the Caribbean. The biomass of reef
   fishes and invertebrates required to support historical seal populations
   was 732-1018 g m(-2) of reefs, which exceeds that found on any Caribbean
   reef today and is comparable with those measured in remote Pacific
   reefs. Quantitative estimates of historically dense monk seal colonies
   and their consumption rates on pristine reefs provide concrete data on
   the magnitude of decline in animal biomass on Caribbean coral reefs.
   Realistic reconstruction of these past ecosystems is critical to
   understanding the profound and long-lasting effect of human hunting on
   the functioning of coral reef ecosystems.

AB Coarse size (> 63 mu m) radiolarian fluxes along the Equator in the

   (Stations MT3, MT4, MT5, MT6 and MT7) were examined during January 1999
   to January 2003 in order to evaluate how radiolarian assemblages respond
   to the El Nino Southern Oscillations (ENSO). Radiolarian fluxes were
   constrained by the water masses: the Western Pacific Warm Pool (WPWP)
   located in the west and the Equatorial Upwelling Region (EUR) east of
   the WPWP in the central equatorial Pacific. In general, radiolarian
   fluxes gradually increased from the western sites to the eastern sites,
   responding to the increases in nutrient supply and primary production in
   the euphotic layer. Notable annual cycles of radiolarian fluxes observed
   at the two Stations with nearly complete time series (MT3 and MT5) were
   likely corresponding to the rainy seasons of Papua New Guinea (MT3) and
   the extent of upwelling intensity in the equatorial Pacific (MT3 and
   MT5). With transition from La Nina to El Nino during 2001 to 2002, high
   radiolarian fluxes were coincident with cooler surface water. Among the
   radiolarian taxa, Lithomelissa sp. group and Pseudocubus obeliscus
   Haeckel 1887, which were mainly dwelling in the surface water in the
   EUR, responded distinctively to the WPWP excursion and decreased their
   fluxes as surface water temperature rose.

   sp., found from the Marshall Islands to the Red Sea, is distinguished by
   its reddish body color, a distinct black or maroon longitudinal line on
   the foot, a posterior projection on the posterior shield and a penis
   with a chitinous, sickle-shaped spine and numerous smaller spines.
   Philinopsis coronata n. sp., known only from the Philippines, is similar
   to P. falciphallus but dominated by yellow body color and a ventral
   surface of the foot with yellow and maroon spots. It has a
   trumpet-shaped penis with a crown of rounded tubercles on the apex and
   anterior and posterior zones of penial spines. Philinopsis
   ctenophoraphaga n. sp. is found from the Philippines, Indonesia and the
   Red Sea. It feeds on platyctene ctenophores, including Coeloplana
   meteroris. It can be distinguished by its elongate posterior lobe of the
   head-shield, reddish color with white spots, thinly muscularized buccal
   mass and simple, unarmed penis. Chelidonura mandroroa n. sp. is
   characterized by its black body with orange patches lined by yellow. It
   has a simple penis with a cuticularized apical papilla. This species has
   been found from Japan, Taiwan, the Philippines, Indonesia, Madagascar
   and Kenya. Chelidonura alisonae n. sp. is apparently restricted to the
   central and eastern Pacific of the Hawai'ian Islands, Johnston Island,
   the Marianas Islands and Easter Island. It is similar in coloration to
   C. hirundinina, but has orange lines on the dorsal and lateral shields
   and has a broad right posterior lobe rather than an acutely pointed one.
   The penis is simple and unarmed. Odontoglaja mosaica n. sp., found from
   the Indian Ocean of Madagascar and South Africa, differs from O.
   guamensis by possessing a reticulate pattern on the notum rather than a
   pattern of brown spots. It also has a shorter penial papilla that is

AB Tropical cyclogenesis critically depends on the presence of warm water
   at the sea surface. For the North Atlantic basin as a whole, the
   tropical storm season starts in May, peaks in September, and then
   declines, generally following the seasonal warming and cooling of sea
   surface temperature. In the Caribbean, in contrast, there is a distinct
   bimodal distribution in the number of tropical storms formed, with peaks
   in June and October separated by a significant minimum in July. The
   timing of the observed minimum in tropical cyclogenesis appears to be
   related to the strengthening of the easterly trade winds over the
   Caribbean associated with the onset of the so-called veranillo, or
   midsummer drought (MSD), previously recognized over south-central
   Mexico, Central America, and parts of the Caribbean. It appears that the
   observed minimum in cyclogenesis is caused by a combination of
   environmental factors related to the strengthening of the easterly trade
   winds across the Caribbean Basin. The strengthening easterly trade winds
   and their associated changes in wind stress curl give rise to enhanced
   upwelling in the southwestern Caribbean. This appears to trigger an
   enhanced local atmosphere-ocean coupling, giving rise to very
   unfavorable conditions in several environmental variables including
   cooler sea surface temperature (SST), higher sea level pressure (SLP),
   increase in outgoing longwave radiation (OLR), and decrease in
   precipitable water content (PRW). Moreover, strengthening trade winds
   result in increases in tropospheric vertical wind shear (VSH). Except
   for OLR, these environmental variables become least favorable for
   southwestern Caribbean cyclogenesis in July. In contrast, the transition
   from weak to intense convective activity in the eastern Pacific results
   in weaker trade winds in the Caribbean in October. The resulting
   westerly wind anomalies lead to weakening upwelling, warmer SST,
   enhanced convection, and moist air coupled with weaker VSH in the
   southwestern Caribbean. All variables, except OLR, then become most
   favorable for cyclogenesis. In the rest of the Caribbean, some of the
   conditions, primarily SST related, are not fully met. Nevertheless, the
   southwestern Caribbean appears to dominate the rest of the Caribbean in
   terms of setting the stage for either favorable or unfavorable
   conditions for cyclogenesis in the whole Caribbean Basin. Therefore,
   ocean-atmosphere interaction over the southwestern Caribbean appears to
   play an integral role in both suppressing and enhancing tropical
   cyclogenesis in the Caribbean on an annual basis.

   was studied under field and laboratory conditions. The species is
   univoltine. Adult activity commenced soon after the onset of the rainy
   season. Adults emerged just before dusk for mating. Males aggregated,
   probably in response to pheromonal cues from females. The adults (both
   sexes) lived for 3-4 weeks but did not appear to feed. Larvae require
   live root material as an essential dietary component. Other larval food
   plants were Imperata cylindrica, Saccharum spontaneum, Panicum maximum,
   Pennisetum purpureum and Zea mays. The biology of L. reuleauxi is

AB Sweet potato is the major staple food crop in PNG, providing around two
   thirds of total dietary intake. Annual production is currently 2.9
   million tonnes per year with 75% of the crop produced in the Highlands.
   Whilst the crop is grown across the country, the Highland areas are
   particularly reliant on sweet potato as a food and animal feed source.
   As the main staple food crop, sweet potato tends to be consumed close to
   where it is grown, although there is a small amount marketed to the
   distant markets of Lae and Port Moresby. Poor post-harvest handling,
   storage and transportation result in a product with a short shelf life
   (3 weeks) and poor quality characteristics. Losses to distant markets
   are high, with 30-50% of product being unsaleable on arrival in Lae or
   Port Moresby, due to rots and/or physical damage. The potential for
   marketing sweet potato to distant markets has increased significantly in
   recent years due to increasing urbanization. The decline in the value of
   the Kina has also made locally produced sweet potato more competitive
   with imported rice and wheat products. Consultations with PNG
   researchers and government agencies have identified consumer
   preferences, marketing and post-harvest management of sweet potatoes as
   priority research areas. The objectives of this paper are to understand
   the operational and relational aspects of sweet potato supply chains
   based on a literature review and semi-structured personal interviews and
   to identify marketing problems existing in the sweet potato supply
   chain.

AB Large deposits of Fe-Si-Mn oxyhydroxide, intimately associated with
   active warm springs, cover the flanks and caldera of Franklin Seamount
   in the western Woodlark Basin, Papua New Guinea. The deposits are
   dominated by poorly crystalline Fe oxyhydroxide, so-called two-XRD-line
   ferrihydrite. Data on hydrothermal samples of ferrihydrite from FranMin
   Seamount provide new insights into the atomic structure and chemical
   composition of this mineral. Electron microscopy supported by X-ray and
   selected-area electron-diffraction (XRD, SAED) analysis shows that the
   Franklin Seamount ferrihydrite consists of soft friable agglomerates of
   randomly stacked colloidal platelets or crystallites, 20-90 Angstrom in
   diameter, which possess short-range atomic order in two dimensions and
   highly variable specific surface-areas. Differential thermal analysis
   indicates that the ferrihydrite is very stable, not transforming to
   hematite until 570 degrees C. Semiquantitative energy-dispersion
   spectroscopy (EDS) analysis with a spatial resolution of 35 A indicates
   that agglomerates of pure ferrihydrite contain important amounts of Si
   (on average, 7.5 wt.% Si) and a constant Si:Fe ratio (on average, 0.45,
   atomic proportions) plus minor but variable amounts of sorbed P, S and
   As. Individual crystallites exhibit very little beam-induced damage
   during the EDS analysis. We suggest that Si is capable of being
   incorporated within the structure of the ferrihydrite. This suggestion
   is supported by XRD patterns showing a significant shift in the 11 (hk)
   hump to higher values of d, compared to Si-free ferrihydrite, and by the
   thermal stability of the mineral. EDS results and results of bulk
   analyses demonstrate the wide range of compositions of two-XRD-line
   ferrihydrite; nevertheless, an average composition of
   (VI)(Fe)(2.9)(IV)(Si, Fe, Al)(1.3)(O, OH, H2O)(12) is proposed for the
   samples from Franklin Seamount.

AB Fiji's tourism industry has evolved considerably in the past 30 years
   with past and present governments striving to support and promote the
   sector despite competing development priorities. This study examines the
   effects of tourism on the economic growth of Fiji, a small island
   economy, over the period 1975 to 2015. Using a neoclassical framework
   and the autoregressive distributed lag bound procedure, the short-run
   and the long-run effects are explored while accounting for structural
   breaks. The long-run and short-run results indicate that a 1% increase
   in visitor arrivals contribute about 0.13% and 0.20% to the per capita
   income, respectively. Additionally, a unidirectional causality from
   economic growth to tourism and a mutually reinforcing effect between
   capital investment and tourism are noted. Thus, greater impact of
   tourism on the economic growth can be realized through tourism-related
   investment activities such as improvements in airports, roads,
   transportation, telecommunications, financial sector, technology, and
   natural parks and beaches.

AB Languages share key evolutionary properties with biological species, and
   global-level spatial congruence in richness and threat is documented
   between languages and several taxonomic groups. However, there is little
   understanding of the functional connection between diversification or
   extinction in languages and species, or the relationship between
   linguistic and species richness across different spatial scales. New
   Guinea is the world's most linguistically rich region and contains
   extremely high biological diversity. We demonstrate significant positive
   relationships between language and mammal richness in New Guinea across
   multiple spatial scales, revealing a likely functional relationship over
   scales at which infra-island diversification may occur. However,
   correlations are driven by spatial congruence between low levels of
   language and species richness. Regional biocultural richness may have
   showed closer congruence before New Guinea's linguistic landscape was
   altered by Holocene demographic events. In contrast to global studies,
   we demonstrate a significant negative correlation across New Guinea
   between areas with high levels of threatened languages and threatened
   mammals, indicating that landscape-scale threats differ between these
   groups. Spatial resource prioritization to conserve biodiversity may not
   benefit threatened languages, and conservation policy must adopt a
   multi-faceted approach to protect biocultural diversity as a whole.

   Doriprismatica balut sp. nov., Doriprismatica rossi sp. nov., and
   Doriprismatica marinae sp. nov.. Glossodoris pallida and G. buko exhibit
   extreme differences in radular structure in addition to a clear
   biogeographic split in range. Glossodoris bonwanga, G. andersonae, G.
   acosti and G. sp. cf. cincta, share morphological and geographic
   differences but these are not as pronounced as in G. pallida and G.
   buko. More detailed study of the G. cincta complex is necessary to
   resolve some remaining systematic challenges. Doriprismatica balut is
   clearly distinct from all other congeners based on molecular and
   morphological characters. In contrast, D. rossi and D. marinae are not
   strongly divergent genetically, but have major morphological divergences
   that clearly distinguish them.

AB The decline and potential recovery of Caribbean reefs has been the
   subject of intense discussion and is of great interest to reef
   ecologists and managers. The recent return of Diadema antillarum sea
   urchins at some Caribbean locations and the concomitant changes in coral
   cover and recruitment. provide a new perspective on the reversibility of
   Caribbean coral reef decline. This study examined the influence of
   recovering populations of Diadema and the subsequent formation of dense
   urchin zones on the growth and density of newly settled juvenile
   scleractinian corals. In these urchin zones, where Diadema graze algae,
   we documented higher growth rates of juvenile corals, and higher
   densities of small juvenile recruits (likely to be important precursors
   to reef recovery). Coral survivorship was higher for juvenile corals
   living in urchin versus algal zones. Roughly 83% of the juvenile corals
   in urchin zones survived over the 2 yr period of the study, while
   similar to 69% survived in the algal zones. Corals in the urchin zones
   increased in major diameter by an average of 75 +/- 7% from 2001 to 2003
   versus 24 +/- 4% for corals in the algal zones during the same time
   period. The relatively abrupt decrease in macroalgal cover and the signs
   of increasing coral cover along the north coast of Jamaica following the
   return of Diadema, reported here and by other authors, suggest that
   these reefs have undergone rapid phase shifts, rather than being
   constrained to alternate stable states. In the Caribbean, it appears
   that Diadema are effective at enhancing scleractinian coral recruitment
   and growth and thus could be used as an important manipulative tool for
   returning reefs to a coral dominated state, especially on reefs that are
   severely overfished.

AB Background: New marine invasions have been recorded in increasing
   numbers along the world's coasts due in part to the warming of the
   oceans and the ability of many invasive marine species to tolerate a
   broader thermal range than native species. Several marine invertebrate
   species have invaded the U. S. southern and mid-Atlantic coast from the
   Caribbean and this poleward range expansion has been termed 'Caribbean
   Creep'. While models have predicted the continued decline of global
   biodiversity over the next 100 years due to global climate change, few
   studies have examined the episodic impacts of prolonged cold events that
   could impact species range expansions.
   Methodology/Principal Findings: A pronounced cold spell occurred in
   January 2010 in the U. S. southern and mid-Atlantic coast and resulted
   in the mortality of several terrestrial and marine species. To
   experimentally test whether cold-water temperatures may have caused the
   disappearance of one species of the 'Caribbean Creep' we exposed the
   non-native crab Petrolisthes armatus to different thermal treatments
   that mimicked abnormal and severe winter temperatures. Our findings
   indicate that Petrolisthes armatus cannot tolerate prolonged and extreme
   cold temperatures (4-6 degrees C) and suggest that aperiodic cold
   winters may be a critical 'reset' mechanism that will limit the range
   expansion of other 'Caribbean Creep' species.
   Conclusions/Significance: We suggest that temperature 'aberrations' such
   as 'cold snaps' are an important and overlooked part of climate change.
   These climate fluctuations should be accounted for in future studies and
   models, particularly with reference to introduced subtropical and
   tropical species and predictions of both rates of invasion and rates of
   unidirectional geographic expansion.

AB Papua New Guinea's coral reefs are of global significance in extent and
   diversity. They are ver poorly studied. The primary human uses are
   subsistence and artisanal commercial fisheries. While the reef fishery
   resources are underutilized on a national scale, localized overfishing
   has occurred where there has been access to cash markets. PNG reefs are
   thought to be relatively undisturbed, but there are insufficient data
   for objective assessment of their status. Major threats include
   sedimentation due to forestry, agriculture and mining, and damage from
   blast fishing. Mining has caused reef damage in at least one location,
   and mangrove deforestation is accelerating. Eutrophication and other
   pollution may be a problem in localized areas, especially near urban
   centres.

AB We reviewed the tectonostratigraphic evolution of the Jurassic-Cenozoic
   collision between the North American and the Caribbean plate using more
   than 30,000 km (18,641 mi) of regional two-dimensional (2-D) academic
   seismic lines and Deep Sea Drilling Project wells of Leg 77. The main
   objective is to perform one-dimensional subsidence analysis and 2-D
   flexural modeling to better understand how the Caribbean collision may
   have controlled the stratigraphic evolution of the offshore Cuba region.
   Five main tectonic phases previously proposed were recognized: (1) Late
   Triassic-Jurassic rifting between South and North America that led to
   the formation of the proto-Caribbean plate; this event is interpreted as
   half grabens controlled by fault family 1 as the
   east-northeast-south-southwest-striking faults; (2) Middle-Late Jurassic
   anticlockwise rotation of the Yucatan block and formation of the Gulf of
   Mexico; this event resulted in north-northwest-south-southeast striking
   faults of fault family 2 controlling half-graben structures; (3) Early
   Cretaceous passive margin development characterized by carbonate
   sedimentation; sedimentation was controlled by normal subsidence and
   eustatic changes, and because of high eustatic seas during the Late
   Cretaceous, the carbonate platform drowned; (4) Late
   Cretaceous-Paleogene collision between the Caribbean plate, resulting in
   the Cuban fold and thrust belt province, the foreland basin province,
   and the platform margin province; the platform margin province
   represents the submerged paleoforebulge, which was formed as a flexural
   response to the tectonic load of the Great Arc of the Caribbean during
   initial Late Cretaceous-Paleocene collision and foreland basin
   development that was subsequently submerged during the Eocene to the
   present water depths as the arc tectonic load reached the maximum
   collision; and (5) Late Cenozoic large deep-sea erosional features and
   constructional sediment drifts related to the formation of the
   Oligocene-Holocene Loop Current-Gulf Stream that flows from the northern
   Caribbean into the Straits of Florida and to the north Atlantic.

AB Gloiotrichus (Liagoraceae; Nemaliales), a red algal genus originally
   described from Western Australia and later found in Hawaii, is reported
   for the first time in the western Atlantic Ocean, from the Caribbean
   Sea. A new species, G. vermiculatus, is described based on specimens
   collected from subtidal waters near Carrie Bow Cay, Belize and off St.
   John, U.S. Virgin Islands. Features of the new species are compared with
   G. fractalis Huisman et Kraft (1994), the generitype, and only other
   species presently in the genus. Gloiotrichus vermiculatus differs
   reproductively; in having fewer cells in its carpogonial branch, (3-) 4
   (-5) cells versus 5-8 cells for G. fractalis; and dioecious gametophytes
   while those of G. fractalis are monoecious. The timing of sterile
   lateral filament initiation from carpogonial branch cells varies between
   the two species, with G. fractalis generally initiating them before the
   first transverse division of the zygote, while those of G. vermiculatus
   are typically initiated concurrently or after the first division. The
   basal cell or other proximal cells of the sterile lateral filaments
   occasionally issue rhizoid-like filaments that can develop to a higher
   degree in G. vermiculatus, where they may loosely drape or encircle
   carpogonial branch cells. The new species differs vegetatively from G.
   fractalis in its longer (290-500 mu m) and more complex primary cortical
   fascicles, which are trichotomously to polychotomously branched, not
   only at the basal division but at several inner divisions, thereafter
   the cortical filaments are subdichotomously branched outward, while
   those of G. fractalis are described as subdichotomously branched
   throughout.

AB The risk of global extinction of reef-building coral species is
   increasing. We evaluated extinction risk using a biological trait-based
   resiliency index that was compared with Caribbean extinction during the
   Plio-Pleistocene, and with extinction risk determined by the
   International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). Through the
   Plio-Pleistocene, the Caribbean supported more diverse coral assemblages
   than today and shared considerable overlap with contemporary
   Indo-Pacific reefs. A clear association was found between extant
   Plio-Pleistocene coral genera and our positive resilience scores.
   Regional extinction in the past and vulnerability in the present
   suggests that Pocillopora, Stylophora and foliose Pavona are among the
   most susceptible taxa to local and regional isolation. These same taxa
   were among the most abundant corals in the Caribbean Pliocene.
   Therefore, a widespread distribution did not equate with immunity to
   regional extinction. The strong relationship between past and present
   vulnerability suggests that regional extinction events are trait-based
   and not merely random episodes. We found several inconsistencies between
   our data and the IUCN scores, which suggest a need to critically
   re-examine what constitutes coral vulnerability.

AB Using qualitative and quantitative analyses of planktonic foraminifera
   assemblages, delta O-18 measurements, Mg/Ca-temperature relationship
   (Globigerinoides ruber pink sensu stricto) data and sea-surface
   temperatures (SSTs) derived from artificial neural network (ANN)
   transfer functions, a reconstruction was made of upper water mass
   variability in the Anegada-Jungfern Passage (AJP), northeastern
   Caribbean Sea, over the last c. 11,100 years. Our record is based on the
   study of two marine sediment cores and reveals three main circulation
   stages during the Holocene. In the early-Holocene (11,100-6300 cal. yr
   BP), ANN-based SST estimations indicate moderately cooler than present
   winter condition in the NE Caribbean with SSTs of similar to 25.5
   degrees C. These conditions presumably reflect advection of well-mixed
   upper water masses from the Guyana upwelling area associated with a
   strong Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) and enhanced
   trade wind activity, linked to a more northerly location of the
   inter-tropical convergence zone (ITCZ). Between 6300 and 3700 cal. yr
   BP, a relative warming of winter SSTs (similar to 26.5 degrees C) was
   probably related to a weaker circulation and upper water mass mixing
   because of less intense trade wind activity, as the ITCZ moved
   southwards. From 3700 cal. yr BP to the present, the region was
   characterised by small seasonal SST variations and generally stable
   winter and summer SSTs. The data suggest a minor shift in the (sub)
   surface inflow pattern during the last 2000 years, possibly related to
   changes in Northern Hemisphere large-scale atmospheric circulation also
   observed at higher latitude. The ANN-based temperature pattern is
   supported by fluctuations in the Mg/Ca-derived temperature record,
   although temperature maxima derived from the Mg/Ca ratio appear
   anomalously high. On a Holocene timescale, we conclude that the
   northeastern Caribbean SST and circulation regime have been mainly
   dependent on the position of the ITCZ, which, in turn, is controlled by
   changes in hemispheric solar insolation.

   stratified cluster sample survey including questions on diet and
   anthropometry of children under five years of age. Regression analyses
   including 25,022 children from this survey show that variation in
   stature by altitude and precipitation level can largely be accounted for
   by differences in the fat and protein contents of village diets.
   Differences in linear growth rate between children living on different
   landforms show less relationship with diet.
   Genetic distances based on Class I HLA gene frequencies were calculated
   for 29 populations. Population mean recumbent lengths were estimated
   adjusted for age, diet, and environmental variables. The differences
   between populations in these average lengths were calculated. No
   significant correlation was found between genetic distances and
   differences in length. Genetic differences between ancestral populations
   as tracked by the HLA system do not appear to be an important factor
   contributing to variation in linear growth of Papua New Guinean
   children.

   period were also presented in terms of the activity of cloud convection
   derived from T-BB data of GMS and zonal wind changes observed by a wind
   profiler. Surface winds were changeable throughout the observation
   period; however, an episodic strong westerly wind was observed from the
   end of December to early January. The most active stage of cloud
   convection, which was characterized by a decrease of solar radiation in
   the afternoon, was observed before the westerly wind episode. Morning
   convection was, however, prominent during the period of the strong
   westerly wind. A diurnal change of solar radiation was also compared
   with the change of latent and sensible heat fluxes obtained using the
   eddy correlation method. Energy fluxes on a ground surface indicated a
   quick response within about 30 minutes to solar radiation change. Latent
   and sensible heat fluxes were almost zero at nighttime, but the maximum
   value of latent and sensible heat fluxes in the daytime were about 270
   and 200 Wm(-2), respectively.

AB Linuche unguiculata (Schwartz) seasonally forms patches in the Caribbean
   Sea and Indo-Pacific Ocean. Eighteen patches of medusae varying from
   about 500 m2 to nearly 1 km2 in area, were documented along the Belize
   barrier reef in March and April 1987, April 1988, and March and April
   1990. The shape of each patch and the inter-medusa distances varied with
   wind velocity. At low wind speed (< 4 m s-1) patches were elliptical or
   circular and the individual medusae were separated by distances of 0.5
   m, whereas at higher speeds windrows were evident and medusae were
   closer together. Windrows probably form by horizontal advection owing to
   convergence by Langmuir circulations. Because individual patches might
   exist for up to 4 mo as they drift downwind, and because winds of
   sufficient speed to produce Langmuir circulations do not always occur, a
   mechanism is necessary to maintain patch integrity during calms. In situ
   observations and in vitro video recording showed that the medusae swam
   in horizontal, near-surface, circular, clockwise trajectories. Although
   swimming speed was relatively high (up to 8 cm s-1), net displacement
   velocity can be low (< 1 cm s-1). Thus, circular swimming probably
   reduces cluster breakup. Patch formation probably improves reproductive
   success by reducing sperm dilution.

   thylakoid fine structure is different from that known in other
   cyanelles. Neither sponge cell arrangement nor algal cell wall structure
   show reactions to the symbiotic habit. Nutrient transfer from alga to
   sponge is accomplished predominantly by means of dissolved assimilation
   products rather than by phagocytosis of whole cells, thus being
   comparable to the mechanism known from similar symbioses with
   dinoflagellates.

   (Poey) and Gobiesox barbatulus Starks are reported for the 1st time from
   the western Caribbean and G. nudus (Linnaeus) is recorded for the 1st
   time from Honduras. Acyrtops amplicirrus is tentatively recognized as
   distinct from A. beryllina (Hildebrand and Ginsburg). G. barbatulus
   Starks is distinguished from G. strumosus on the basis of development of
   barbels on the pre- and suborbital areas, fringing of the dermal flaps
   on the anterior nostrils and more numerous and narrow lines radiating
   from the eye in the case of G. barbatulus. Principal components analysis
   of 13 morphometric characters resulted in clear separation of the 2
   forms along the 1st component axis. Both species are mainland forms
   occurring in turbid and often rackish water. G. barbatulus is a southern
   form occurring from Brazil to Belize; G. strumosus is a northern form
   occurring from Campeche, Mexico to Virginia [USA]. The apparent
   distributional boundary (centered on the east coast of the Yucatan
   Peninsula, Mexico) between the 2 agrees with the boundary between the
   northern and southern continental shorefish faunas recognized by Robins

AB Loss of zooxanthellar symbionts from coral hosts, or "bleaching" has
   been increasingly noted since the 1980's, and often attributed to
   elevated sea water temperatures. Here we document the first bleaching
   events recorded in Micronesia, one on Majuro Atoll in 1992 and another
   on Guam in 1994. The first caused up to 99% mortality of Acropora,
   altering the community structure of affected lagoonal fringing reefs
   from Acropora-and-Porites-dominated to Porites-dominated. Mortality of
   other scleractinians was low, but the common soft coral Lobophytum
   pauciflorum underwent large-scale dieback. Mortality in Majuro lagoon
   increased from west to east, peaking in the metropolitan area at the
   east end. The bleaching event on Guam was island-wide, in the warm
   season but not associated with unusually high temperatures, and
   associated with little mortality. Fifty-one of 75 surveyed taxa of
   corals bleached on Guam and 15 of 25 taxa on Majuro. Both scleractinians
   and alcyonaceans exhibited consistent species-specific sensitivity to
   bleaching among these and other locations in the tropical Pacific basin.
   The cause of these bleaching events is unclear, but the pattern on
   Majuro is suggestive of anthropogenic influence. Lack of bleaching at
   rural Mili Atoll 25 km from Majuro and lack of above average
   temperatures on Guam and Majuro suggest that regional ocean warming was
   not involved in either event.

   9,11-secodinosterol (Compound 2), both of which have been previously

AB Fieldwork conducted throughout Timor-Leste in September 2004 and July
   2009 resulted in a collection or recording of 263 herpetological
   specimens (100 amphibians, 163 reptiles), comprising at least seven
   species of frogs and toads, 20 species of lizards, seven species of
   snakes, two species of turtles, and one species of crocodile. Among the
   amphibians, the most frequently encountered species were toads
   (Duttaphrynus melanostictus), rice paddy frogs (genus Fejervarya), and
   rhacophorid treefrogs (Polypedates cf. leucomystax). All three variants
   of rice paddy frogs encountered represent undescribed species similar to
   E verruculosa from neighboring Wetar Island. Records of E cancrivora and
   E limnocharis for Timor Island are apparently errors based on
   misidentification. We obtained voucher specimens for a total of 147
   lizards and voucher photographs only for four specimens of Varanus
   timorensis. Aside from geckos frequently associated with human
   habitations (e.g., Gehyra mutilata, Gekko gecko, Hemidactylus frenatus,
   H. platyurus), we discovered an as yet undescribed species of bent-toed
   gecko, genus Cyrtodactylus, in the Same valley. Our specimens of H.
   platyurus are the first record of this species from Timor-Leste.
   Commonly encountered skinks included four-fingered skinks (genus
   Carlia), wedge skinks (genus Sphenommphus), and night skinks (genus
   Eremiascincus). Notable among the 15 snakes collected was the frequency
   of pitvipers (Cryptelytrops insularis), which amounted to over 25% of
   all snakes. Our specimen of the wolfsnake Lycodon subcinctus is the
   first record of this species for Timor-Leste. Based on these findings,
   it appears that the biodiversity of amphibians and reptiles in this
   remote corner of Wallacea is much greater than previously thought,
   particularly with respect to scincid lizards. The detail we provide in
   the species accounts is designed to allow the use of this report as a
   preliminary field guide to the amphibians and reptiles of Timor-Leste.
   However, survey work is ongoing.

AB The stratigraphy of Antigua reflects 1) episodic marine incursions onto
   an Oligocene islandarc volcano, the basement of the Antigua-Barbuda
   platform; 2) ascendancy of the marine realm over the terrestrial as
   volcanism waned. The earliest and shortest-lived carbonate-producing
   communities formed calcareous tuffs with few benthic fossil species.
   Open-marine conditions yielded biostromal communities of pioneer
   scleractinian coral species, other benthos and some planktic
   foraminifera. Rich coralgal communities formed as biostromes and patch
   reefs, fringing or on a bank barrier, sparingly in the Basal Volcanic
   Suite (BVS), more frequently in the Central Plain Group (CPG) and
   abundantly in the lower part of the Antigua Formation (AF). Deeper
   water, island-slope deposits of mostly fine-grained limestone are
   important in the AF, especially in its upper part. Numerous fossils,
   both benthic and planktic, may record variation in productivity of
   surface waters over the island slope. The succession of limestones and
   their paleontologic and sedimentary features record a deepening of the
   Oligocene sea around Antigua. Volcanism prevalent in the early stages of
   island development inhibited marine and carbonate sediments. After
   volcanism waned and ended, the upper part of the CPG and the AF recorded
   eustatic changes of sea level. Sedimentary features in the AF and the
   structure of the three formations show Antigua has hardly been tilted
   since the Oligocene, but only elevated as the Caribbean plate rose along
   the Lesser Antilles Island Arc. One deposit of elevated Holocene
   limestone is described.

   to extend our understanding of remote acculturation by investigating
   potential vehicles of indirect and intermittent intercultural contact.
   Cluster analyses replicated prior findings: relative to Traditional
   Jamaican adolescents (62%), Americanized Jamaican adolescents (38%)
   reported stronger European American cultural orientation, lower Jamaican
   orientation, lower family obligations, and greater conflict with
   parents. More U.S. media (girls) and less local media and local sports
   (all) were the primary vehicles of intercultural contact predicting
   higher odds of Americanization. U.S. food, U.S. tourism, and
   transnational communication were also linked to U.S. orientation.
   Findings have implications for acculturation research and for practice
   and policy targeting Caribbean youth and families. (C) 2014 Elsevier

AB The Macaronesian Islands comprise the Atlantic archipelagos of Azores,
   Madeira, Selvagens, Canaries and Cape Verde. These islands were a major
   focus for plant exploration during the 17th and 18th centuries. Sir Hans
   Sloane (1660-1753), one of the most important patrons and sponsors of
   natural sciences and botanical research, visited Madeira on his way to
   Jamaica in 1687. Although he stayed in Madeira for only three days, he
   collected plant specimens of 38 taxa (including one brown alga) and made
   important observations concerning the flora and fauna of Madeira from
   near Funchal. Sixty-six polynomial names of plants from the island are
   recorded in Sloane's published work along with 18 copperplate
   engravings, ostensibly from Madeira, although our study shows that only
   thirteen of them are of taxa occurring on the island. Fourteen of the
   sixty-six polynomials reported by Sloane relate to Macaronesian endemic
   taxa, six of them restricted to Madeira. Our study shows that nine of
   the fifteen polynomials that he putatively recorded for Madeira and/or
   the Antilles or for which he was unsure of their origin are from the
   West Indies and do not occur on this Macaronesian island. Two of the
   taxa that are listed for Madeira and the Caribbean Islands were likely
   to be present in both insular systems. Although there is evidence of
   earlier botanical explorations in Macaronesia, the herbarium collections
   made by Sloane in Madeira represent the earliest documented plant
   hunting expedition to Macaronesia, and Sir Hans Sloane can be considered
   as one of the pioneers of botanical exploration in these Atlantic
   Islands. Sloane's records provide an early floristic study of a diverse
   island flora.

   assess them, we monitored 479 children below the age of 5 years living
   in a well-defined urban community in Port Moresby, Papua New Guinea, for
   one year, using the nested case-control method with density sampling. 
   Comparing the odds ratios, we found that eating food that had been kept
   for more than 12 h, eating away from home, temporary absence of mother
   from home for more than one day, and the presence of respiratory
   infection in the child, were statistically associated with an increased
   risk of diarrhoea.  We conclude that these transient factors must be
   addressed if effective control of diarrhoea is to be achieved.  We
   believe that further studies will identify the factors more precisely
   and provide a better understanding of the method we have employed.

   occurrence and percentage by number indices, as well as multivariate
   analyses. Overall, S. micrurum exhibited a generalist feeding strategy
   with a relatively broad niche width. Analyses indicated Crustacea
   (especially Brachyura) and Polychaeta as the dominant prey items,
   although other items, such as Foraminifera, Caridae or Actinopterigii,
   were preyed on more often or in larger quantities, depending on the
   sampling date. An ontogenetic shift in diet was also observed with
   small-sized individuals mostly consuming Crustacea, whereas medium- or
   large-sized specimens fed on Actinopterigii more often. Diet composition
   appeared to be more related to differences in benthic assemblages
   between sampling dates due to the geographical characteristics of Cabo
   Verde. Results presented here support the need for further studies in
   the area, mainly those considering the composition and seasonal
   variation of invertebrate communities, to improve the knowledge of the
   trophic structure of commercially important species within this area.

AB The longfin mako (Isurus paucus) is a poorly studied oceanic shark taken
   in fisheries throughout its worldwide range in temperate and tropical
   waters. Satellite- linked tags were deployed to investigate the
   movements of 2 mature males, one tagged in the northeastern Gulf of
   Mexico (GOM) and the other off northern Cuba. Horizontal tracks
   estimated by using likelihood methods were similar for these sharks;
   comparable movements were documented from the GOM, through the Straits
   of Florida and the Bahamas, and into the open Atlantic Ocean where they
   converged on the Mid- Atlantic Bight. Depth and temperature ranges were
   0- 1767 m and 4.0- 28.8 degrees C. A diel pattern of vertical movement
   was evident for both individuals, along with regular forays from cold
   daytime depths to warmer near- surface waters, possibly as an adaptation
   for thermoregulation. The vertical movements of longfin makos allow them
   to exploit vertically migrating prey but these movements increase their
   vulnerability to pelagic longlining. The horizontal movements of these
   sharks reveal the limited benefit of areas currently closed to pelagic
   longlining off the southeastern United States and also indicate the
   connectivity of U.S., Cuban, Mexican, and Bahamian waters for this
   species. Because of the vulnerability of longfin makos to
   overexploitation, improved biological information is needed for accurate
   stock assessments and appropriate management and conservation measures.

AB The Joint Regime Area Jamaica-Colombia (JRA) is a sector of economic
   importance for Colombia but its biodiversity is unknown due to the
   difficult access. Therefore, the Institute of Marine and Coastal
   Research - Invemar in agreement with the National Hydrocarbon Agency -
   ANH, made an expedition in 2011 to obtain a first approximation to the
   diversity of the JRA. Within the groups studied was the plankton, which
   was collected around landforms at 21 sampling stations in the northern
   sector of the JRA, with special plankton nets of 20 µm pore size mesh
   for phytoplankton and 200 µm for zooplankton. Organisms were identified
   to the lowest possible taxonomic category and an ecological analysis was
   performed using descriptive statistics, univariate and multivariate. 183
   morphospecies of phytoplankton and 57 taxa (family and phylum) of
   zooplankton were identified, generating three geographically
   differentiated associations. The phyto and zooplankton found in the JRA
   is part of the plankton community typical of oligotrophic tropical
   oceanic waters and local differences could be due to ocean dynamics
   between the Caribbean Current Surface and landforms of the of San Andrés
   and JRA archipelago.
X4 El Área de Régimen Común Jamaica-Colombia (ARC) es un sector de
   importancia económica para el país pero de difícil acceso,
   desconociéndose en la actualidad su biodiversidad. Por ello el Instituto
   de Investigaciones Marinas y Costeras, en convenio con la Agencia
   Nacional de Hidrocarburos, realizó una expedición en 2011 para obtener
   una primera aproximación a la diversidad del ARC. Dentro de los grupos
   estudiados estuvo el plancton, por lo que se requirió recolectar
   muestras en 21 estaciones dentro del sector norte del ARC, alrededor de
   las geoformas, con redes especializadas de 20 µm de poro de malla para
   fitoplancton y 200 µm para zooplancton. Los organismos fueron
   identificados a la categoría taxonómica más baja posible y se realizó un
   análisis ecológico a partir de estadísticos descriptivos, univariados y
   multivariados. Se identificaron 183 morfoespecies de fitoplancton y 57
   grupos taxonómicos (familia y phylum) de zooplancton, generándose tres
   asociaciones diferenciables geográficamente. El fito y zooplancton
   encontrados en el ARC hace parte de la comunidad planctónica de aguas
   típicas tropicales oceánicas oligotróficas (ATTOO) y las diferencias
   locales se pudieron deber a la dinámica oceánica entre la Corriente
   Superficial del Caribe y a las geoformas del archipiélago de San Andrés
   y del ARC.

AB In 2009 the Haitian Directorate of Potable Water and Sanitation (DINEPA)
   identified an inadequately trained and under-staffed rural workforce as
   one of their main institutional challenges. Plans to address this
   challenge were impacted by the devastating earthquake of January 12,
   2010 and the cholera outbreak of October 2010, both of which further
   complicated Haiti's already poor water and sanitation conditions.
   Recognizing the importance of DINEPA's institutional priorities, donor
   and technical assistance groups provided needed support to improve the
   country's conditions and build the rural water and sanitation workforce.
   This report describes how DINEPA and the US Centers for Disease Control
   and Prevention (CDC) collaborated to design and implement a training
   program for 264 potable water and sanitation technicians for rural
   areas. The paper also describes the initial field activities of the
   newly trained technicians and the immediate impact of their work in the
   rural water, sanitation and hygiene sector.

AB On 24 February 1995, six U.S. soldiers serving with the Multinational
   Force in Haiti became ill after eating a locally caught fish identified
   as the greater amberjack Seriola dumerili. The victims presented with
   nausea, vomiting, watery diarrhea and abdominal cramps 5-8 hr after
   consumption, Also present in some victims were numbness in the
   extremities or perioral region, bradycardia and scalp paresthesia.
   Patients were treated with i,v. hydration therapy and antiemetics. All
   recovered without sequelae over the course of 1-3 months. A portion of
   the cooked fish was obtained for analysis. A semipurified lipid extract
   was prepared according to standard methods and analyzed for the presence
   of Na+ channel site 5 binding activity using a brevetoxin receptor
   binding assay. By this assay, the fish sample contained the equivalent
   of approximately 20 ng Caribbean ciguatoxin/g flesh. The presence of the
   major Caribbean ciguatoxin (C-CTX-1) was confirmed by liquid
   chromatography-mass spectrometry. Using the receptor binding assay to
   monitor activity in TSK and PRP-1 column fractions, two minor toxins
   were detected in addition to C-CTX-1. One of these minor toxins was more
   polar, and the other less polar, than C-CTX-1. These data provide firm
   evidence that a family of C-CTX-1 is responsible for ciguatera in the
   Caribbean. Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.

AB At present the majority of the endemic bird species occurring on Sao
   Tome and Principe remain common, the rarer species being those largely
   confined to primary rainforest. In 1990 the dwarf olive ibis (Bostrychia
   bocagei), Sao Tome fiscal shrike (Lanius newtoni), Sao Tome short-tail
   (Amaurocichla bocagii) were rediscovered and in 1991 the Sao Tome
   grosbeak (Neospiza concolor) was seen for the first time since 1888.
   Lowland primary forest is the only habitat on Sao Tome in which all the
   endemic species are found. Primary forest on Principe remains largely
   unsurveyed since the beginning of the century. Due to the decline in the
   cocoa industry had poor infrastructure post-independence the extent of
   secondary forest is probably at its greatest since the late 1800s. This
   habitat is an important buffer zone against development for the
   remaining primary forest and also contains important populations of many
   of the endemic species, in particular the Sao Tome scops owl (Otus
   hartlaubi), Sao Tome oriole (Oriolus crassirostris) and giant weaver
   (Ploceus grandis). On both islands the remaining areas of primary forest
   need immediate protection and suitable boundaries have been designated
   under the Zona Ecologica plan. Fortunately, except for an important area
   around Lagoa Amelia, primary forest is not under immediate threat,
   although a variety of pressures are likely to increase. In conjunction
   with the protection of primary forest, a plan for managing the remaining
   timber resource on the islands will be a vital requirement, particularly
   if areas of shade forest, an important habitat for endemic bird species
   and a potentially valuable economic resource, are to be conserved and
   sustainably managed.

AB Oceanographic studies were carried out from August 1994 to March 1995 on
   the intrusion of the Fly River plume in Torres Strait. Measurements at
   offshore coral reefs revealed an event of decreased salinity
   (approximate to 24) while salinity of the water over the reefs
   fluctuated between 30-34 the rest of the time. Modelling suggests that
   this event resulted from the reversal of longshore currents advecting
   old river plume water back past the river mouth. There the new river
   water mixed with the old river plume water generating a patch of
   low-salinity water. While such events may be infrequent, they have the
   potential to leave a terrestrial signature on offshore coral reefs, in
   terms of (1) an input of terrigenous sediment and (2) the possible
   incorporation of riverine particulate metal into the food chain. The
   impact during an intrusion event may be significant. In the long term
   the riverine material is diluted in calcareous sediment produced
   throughout the year by bio-erosion of coral reefs. (C) 1999 Elsevier

AB A new species of Akanthepsilonema and the first-stage juvenile of
   Glochinema trispinatum are described. Furthermore, additional
   morphological information is provided for Triepsilonema tripapillata.
   Animals originate from a cold-water coral degradation zone in the
   Porcupine Seabight area (North-East Atlantic Ocean). Akanthepsilonema
   sinecornibus sp. n. differs from A. helleouetae in number of body
   annules, sexual dimorphism in amphid size, absence of copulatory thorns
   in males, absence of large spines and horns, shape of the copulatory
   apparatus, and position of ambulatory setae relative to vulva in
   females. The genus diagnosis for Akanthepsilonema is adjusted to
   incorporate the new species. Akanthepsilonema mainly differs froth every
   other genus in the family by the combination of six rows of ambulatory
   setae situated around the vulva in females and eight subcephalic setae
   not displaced toward the anterior part of the head capsule. Small
   differences between the Papua New Guinea and the Porcupine Seabight
   populations of T. tripapillata indicate minimal intraspecific
   variability. Second-stage juveniles from Papua New Guinea have two rows
   of three ambulatory setae, whereas Porcupine Seabight specimens have two
   rows of four ambulatory setae. First- and fourth-stage juveniles of T.
   tripapillata are described for the first time. Literature data and
   personal observations showed that the molting of first-stage juveniles
   into second-stage juveniles and of third-stage juveniles into
   fourth-stage juveniles involves a decrease in the number of body rings,
   resulting in a loss of flexibility which is possibly compensated for by
   the development (I-II) or the doubling of the number of rows (III-IV) of
   ambulatory setae. This decrease is also linked with the formation of the
   head capsule and the smooth tail tip, although intergeneric variability
   is evident. The molting of second-stage juveniles into third-stage
   juveniles and of fourth-stage,juveniles into adults is also subject to
   intergeneric variability. The variability in the number and orientation
   of caudal gland outlets among different nematode taxa is discussed. The
   presence of separate outlets for the caudal glands seems to be
   widespread within the family Epsilonematidae and has also been observed
   in various other, unrelated taxa of free-living aquatic nematodes,
   although their arrangement in Epsilonematidae is opposite. This aberrant
   arrangement is probably related to the aberrant locomotory pattern in
   this family.

AB This paper combines published and new collection records to provide a
   comprehensive list of ant species collected on Tokelau, a Pacific island
   nation with the world's smallest land area. Twenty-eight ant species
   have been recorded since the late 1950s, 10 in recent surveys, and the
   majority of which are tramp species. Known invasive species such as
   Anoplolepis gracilipes, Monomorium pharaonis, Pheidole megacephala, and
   Tapinoma melanocephalum are present but currently appear to have a
   limited distribution on two of the three atolls. There are no ant
   species endemic to Tokelau, but two Pacific endemics, and 11 Pacific
   natives; 26 listed ant species are present in Samoa, which is the likely
   point of origin for most of Tokelau's ant fauna. Pitfall trap
   collections from three visits between 2002 and 2005 highlight how
   different sampling intensities and locations alter the species
   accumulation rate and species richness and diversity estimates. The
   relationship between total ant species and land area of Pacific islands
   is linear, but combined with earlier records, this study reports more
   ant species from Tokelau than the analysis predicts. This study
   indicates the remote and small nation of Tokelau is as susceptible to
   invasive species as susceptible to invasive species as other larger,
   more populated, land masses in the Pacific.

AB The influence that the evolution of the ENSO cycle has on the moisture
   transport from the major oceanic moisture sources is investigated using
   a sophisticated Lagrangian approach informed by ERA-interim data,
   together with composites of ENSO phases. When maintaining the sources of
   moisture defined for the climatological period 1980-2012, the variations
   in the moisture sinks associated with each of these evaporative sources
   throughout the ENSO cycle reproduce the known patterns of variations of
   the large-scale atmospheric and precipitation systems over this cycle.
   Such variations include those observed in rainfall over the equatorial
   Pacific, in the major Summer monsoon systems, and in subtropical
   rainfall. When the areas of the sources were redefined according to the
   phase of ENSO, most of them remained stationary over the period of
   interest, nevertheless four of them showed notable differences in terms
   of their extents, namely the South Pacific and the Coral Sea (Pacific
   Ocean); the Mexican Caribbean (Atlantic), and the Arabian Sea (Indian).

AB Indo-Pacific lionfish Pterois volitans/miles were likely introduced to
   Florida coastal waters via the aquarium trade and have spread rapidly
   along the southeastern coast of the United States and throughout the
   greater Caribbean region, including Bermuda and the Gulf of Mexico. This
   mesopredator has strong consumptive effects on native demersal fishes,
   especially on coral reefs but also including a variety of other
   nearshore habitats. The invader may also have substantial indirect
   effects on reef ecosystems by over consuming ecologically important
   species. Given growing concern over what is likely the most damaging
   marine fish invasion to date globally, this Theme Section presents
   findings reported during a lionfish symposium at the Gulf and Caribbean
   Fisheries Institute annual conference convened in Panama City, Panama,
   in November 2015. New findings include mechanisms that enhance the
   success of the invader, the extremely broad and variable diet of
   invasive lionfish, the ecological effects of the invader on native fish
   populations in various environmental contexts, and non-consumptive
   interactions between invasive lionfish and native predators.
