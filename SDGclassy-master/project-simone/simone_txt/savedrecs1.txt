AB The information on the mangrove forests for the Pacific region is scarce
   or outdated. A regional assessment based on a consistent methodology and
   data sources was needed to understand their true extent. Our
   investigation offers a regionally consistent, high resolution (30 m),
   and the most comprehensive mapping of mangrove forests on the islands of
   American Samoa, Fiji, French Polynesia, Guam, Hawaii, Kiribati, Marshall
   Islands, Micronesia, Nauru, New Caledonia, Northern Mariana Islands,
   Palau, Papua New Guinea, Samoa, Solomon Islands, Tonga, Tuvalu, Vanuatu,
   and Wallis and Futuna Islands for the year 2000. We employed a hybrid
   supervised and unsupervised image classification technique on a total of
   128 Landsat scenes gathered between 1999 and 2004, and validated the
   results using existing geographic information science (GIS) datasets,
   high resolution imagery, and published literature. We also draw a
   comparative analysis with the mangrove forests inventory published by
   the Food and Agriculture Association (FAO) of the United Nations. Our
   estimate shows a total of 623755 hectares of mangrove forests in the
   Pacific region; an increase of 18% from FAO's estimates. Although
   mangrove forests are disproportionately distributed toward a few larger
   islands on the western Pacific, they are also significant in many
   smaller islands. (C) 2011 Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation

AB This systematic review summarises the data published on the Leptospira
   seroprevalence, serovar diversity and distribution among animal species
   in the Caribbean region. Following Preferred Reporting Items for
   Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) guidelines, and checklist,
   relevant articles were identified and data were extracted and recorded.
   The review provided Leptospira seroprevalence data from 16 Caribbean
   islands (Barbados, Trinidad, Grenada, Puerto Rico, Saint Croix, St.
   Kitts and Nevis, Jamaica, Antigua, Carriacou, Dominica, Guadalupe,
   Martinique, Monserrat, St. Lucia, St. Maarten, and St. Vincent) in a
   variety of animal species. Reviewing the literature highlighted the
   limited amount of data available from limited number of islands. Many of
   the studies conducted have recorded seroprevalences based on variable
   and small samples sizes. Besides, serovar panels used for MAT were not
   consistent between studies. The review indicates that the Leptospira
   exposure in a given geographic location may change with time and
   climatic and environmental conditions, and highlights the need to
   conduct continual surveillance in tropical countries where the climate
   supports the survival of Leptospira in the environment. Specific
   attention must be given to standardization of MAT panels and protocols
   and providing training across laboratories involved in testing. Further,
   animal and environment testing to isolate and identify circulating
   Leptospira spp. in a geographic region must actively be pursued. This
   knowledge is important to implement geographically specific control
   programs, as risk factors of Leptospira transmission is favoured by
   various factors such as change in climatic conditions, urbanization,
   encroachment of wildlife inhabitation, import/export of animals,
   increase in adventure travel, and water related recreational activities.

AB The independent island nations of the South Pacific have a rich and
   threatened terrestrial biota. Despite considerable investment of
   resources into conservation over the last three decades, biodiversity is
   dwindling and protected area systems remain inadequate. This lack of
   success is caused by important differences in cultural, economic,
   landownership, and social factors in developing Pacific Island
   countries, compared to developed nations that often fund conservation
   programs and plans. Despite the obvious need for capacity building and
   information exchange among stakeholders, little collaboration and
   development has eventuated. A coordinated and integrated approach,
   focusing conservation resources on national priorities, is essential to
   achieve efficient conservation. This will need to include active
   involvement of landowners, a good sociocultural understanding of target
   communities, improved collaboration between the various stakeholders,
   provision of sustainable alternative economic activities, and a
   commitment to long funding cycles for projects.

AB Based on analyses done in the preparation of their National

   including, Antigua and Barbuda, Bahamas, Barbados, Dominica, Grenada,
   Haiti, Jamaica, St Kitts and Nevis, St. Lucia, St. Vincent and the
   Grenadines and Trinidad and Tobago are presented, Except for Trinidad
   and Tobago that is fairly industrialized, GHG emissions derive mainly
   from the Energy sector, with the energy industries and transportation
   sub-sectors being the most important. In the case of Haiti, massive
   deforestation has led to important CO2 emissions.
   Not accounting for natural sinks, most Caribbean countries still turn
   out to be net removers of CO2. Emissions of non-CO2 gases, except for
   Trinidad and Tobago are minimal.
   The relatively low levels of GHG emissions, the under developed
   economies and the lack of in-house environmentally sound clean
   technologies therefore make it very difficult for the Small Island
   States of the Caribbean to seriously consider GHG mitigation measures,
   especially in view of the prohibitive costs of such abatement measures.

AB The wetlands of 21 countries and territories of the Pacific Islands
   region are reviewed: American Samoa, Cook Islands, Federated States of
   Micronesia, Fiji, French Polynesia, Guam, Kiribati, Marshall Islands,
   Nauru, New Caledonia, Niue, Northern Mariana Islands, Palau, Papua New
   Guinea, Samoa, Solomon Islands, Tokelau, Tonga, Tuvalu, Vanuatu, and
   Wallis and Futuna. The regions' wetlands are classified into seven
   systems: coral reefs, seagrass beds, mangrove swamps, riverine,
   lacustrine, freshwater swamp forests and marshes. The diversity of
   species in each of these groups is at near global maxima at the west of
   the region, with decline towards the east with increasing isolation, and
   decreasing island size and age. The community structure is unique in
   each country, and many have endemic species with the habitat isolation
   that epitomises this island region. There remain, however, some serious
   gaps in basic inventory, particularly in freshwater biodiversity.
   Threats to wetlands include introduced freshwater species, loss of
   wetlands adjacent to urban growth, downstream effects of mining and land
   clearance, and over-use of mangrove, seagrass and coral reef resources
   by predominant subsistence economies that remain in this region. Only
   five countries are signatories to the Ramsar convention on wetlands, and
   this only recently with seven sites. Wetland managers have identified
   the need for community education, baseline surveys and monitoring,
   better legislation and policy for wetland management, and improved
   capacity of local communities to allow the wise use of their wetlands.

AB Small island states are likely the countries most vulnerable to climate
   variability and long-term climate change. Climate models suggest that
   small island states will experience warmer temperatures and changes in
   rainfall, sod moisture budgets, prevailing winds (speed and direction),
   and patterns of wave action. El Nino events likely will strengthen
   short-term and interannual climate variations. In addition, global mean
   sea level is projected to increase by 0.09-0.88 m by 2100, with variable
   effects on regional and local sea level. To better understand the
   potential human health consequences of these projected changes, a series
   of workshops and a conference organized by the World Health
   Organization, in partnership with the World Meteorological Organization
   and the United Nations Environment Programme, addressed the following
   issues: the current distribution and burden of climate-sensitive
   diseases in small island states, the potential future health impacts of
   climate variability and change, the interventions currently used to
   reduce the burden of climate-sensitive diseases, additional
   interventions that are needed to adapt to current and future health
   impacts, and the health implications of climate variability and change
   in other sectors. Information on these issues is synthesized and key
   recommendations are identified for improving the capacity of the health
   sector to anticipate and prepare for climate variability and change in
   small island states.

AB The steadily increasing world market prices for fossil fuels in the past
   years have significantly increased interest in the development of
   indigenous sources of energy in the Pacific islands. As an import
   substitution strategy, many Pacific island Governments are looking into
   the use of local biomass resources to replace traditionally imported
   fuels such as petrol and diesel by biofuels. An overview of biofuel
   activities is given, with experiences and key achievements in Fiji,
   Samoa, Vanuatu, Solomon Islands, Papua New Guinea, Kiribati and Marshall
   Islands with regard to efforts to develop alternative fuels. There are
   strong linkages between developments in the various Pacific island
   countries and lessons to be learned from experiences and policies
   implemented among Governments in the Pacific region. The paper concludes
   that there is a need for standardization, quality control and testing
   facilities for biofuels in the region. Governments need to investigate
   further the level of support that is required to make biofuel operations
   viable and maximize macroeconomic and environmental benefits.

AB The need for domestic smallholder farming systems to better support food
   and nutrition security in the Caribbean is a pressing challenge. The
   Caribbean Community (CARICOM) faces complex socio-ecological challenges
   related to historical legacies of plantation agriculture, small
   population sizes, geographic isolation, jurisdictional diversity, and
   proneness to natural disasters, all of which underscore the importance
   of fostering system-wide innovation potential. This paper explores the
   factors that are impacting the innovation potential of smallholder
   farming households in four CARICOM small island developing states (St.
   Lucia, St. Kitts-Nevis, Trinidad and Tobago, and Guyana) using data
   collected through producer household surveys, focus groups, and key
   informant interviews. Results indicate that a systemic lack of access to
   finance, markets, and knowledge networks is perceived as limiting
   smallholder innovation potential in the region. Compounding these
   challenges was a pervasive lack of trust reported between actors and
   institutions throughout the agricultural innovation system, hindering
   the potential for collective action. Our findings point to the need for
   more decentralized governance approaches that are capable of
   establishing stronger relationships between actors and institutions to
   enhance knowledge flows in support of regional rural development and
   food and nutrition security objectives.

AB The aim of this paper is twofold. First, we assess the SIDS' pattern
   towards energy sustainability. Second, we try to understand the macro
   factors that drive policy-makers in setting the optimal framework for
   investments in renewable energy sources. The empirical analysis is
   performed on a large dataset of 136 countries and 41 variables observed
   in the time span 2000-2011. Countries analyzed include a sample of 12
   SIDS (Bahrain, Cuba, Dominican Republic, Fiji Islands, Guyana, Haiti,
   Jamaica, Maldives, Mauritius, Papua New Guinea, Singapore, Trinidad and
   Tobago) distributed worldwide. Due to the large number of variables
   collected and their high degree of collinearity, the first step of the
   analysis concerns the implementation of a Principal Component Analysis
   in order to extract factors explaining the majority of variation of the
   original variables. In the second step, three different scenarios of
   modeling are designed to examine the key factors promoting RES
   investments. In a first scenario, we employ a pooled regression model,
   in the second a Fixed Effect model and, in the third, a Random Effect
   model is estimated. The main results of empirical analysis could be
   unexpected at first sight. They show, in fact, that SIDS are not on a
   energy sustainability path. As in the case of other developing
   countries, policy-makers prefer to use resources to improve economic
   aspects of development leaving behind issues related to the
   environmental protection, the use of RES and sustainability. In order to
   improve economic and environmental resilience of SIDS a synergy between
   local governments and international organizations to promote the
   investments in RES is needed. Moreover, an energy plan that clearly
   supports the generation of energy from RES is recommended. Finally
   policy-makers should strength their commitment in raising population's
   awareness toward a green energy generation. Such synergic interventions
   will allow SIDS to achieve a more sustainable development. (C) 2016

AB As small economies with limited resources and common energy-related
   challenges, Small Island Developing States (SIDS) are called to cater
   for the energy needs of current and future generations in a sustainable
   way. The adoption of energy efficient and conservation initiatives as
   well as full use of renewable sources of energy are necessary to address
   their energy-related challenges. A regional approach to energy
   coordination may also address common needs of countries in a particular
   region and harmonize national energy policies in that region. While
   Pacific SIDS and Caribbean SIDS have regional energy frameworks, African
   SIDS do not have a specific regional energy framework. With common
   energy-related challenges as well as specific constraints, to what
   extent do African SIDS need a regional approach to energy planning?
   Comoros, Guinea-Bissau, and Sao Tome and Principe are least developed
   countries (LDCs) whereas Cape Verde, Mauritius and Seychelles have
   higher levels of development as well as policies and better mechanism to
   address energy challenges in the context of climate change. This article
   examines the need for a regional energy framework for African SIDS,
   identifies its main prospects and challenges and makes recommendations
   regarding the main steps to a regional approach to energy management.

AB Rodents are a key pest to agricultural and rural island communities of
   the South Pacific, but there is limited information of their impact on
   the crops and livelihoods of small-scale farmers. The rodent pest
   community is known, but the type and scales of damage to different crops
   on different islands are unknown. Knowledge about rodent pest management
   in other geographical regions may not be directly transferable to the
   Pacific region. Many studies on islands have largely focussed on the
   eradication of rodents from uninhabited islands for conservation
   benefits. These broadscale eradication efforts are unlikely to translate
   to inhabited islands because of complex social and agricultural issues.
   The livelihoods, culture and customs of poor small-scale farmers in the
   South Pacific have a large bearing on the current management of rodents.
   The aim of the present review was to describe the rodent problems,
   impacts and management of rodents on South Pacific islands, and identify
   gaps for further research. We compared and contrasted two case studies.
   The situation in Papua New Guinea is emergent as several introduced
   rodent species are actively invading new areas with wide-ranging
   implications for human livelihoods and conservation. In Vanuatu, we show
   how rodent damage on cocoa plantations can be reduced by good orchard
   hygiene through pruning and weeding, which also has benefits for the
   management of black pod disease. We conclude that (1) damage levels are
   unknown and unreported, (2) the impacts on human health are unknown, (3)
   the relationships between the pest species and their food sources,
   breeding and movements are not known, and (4) the situation in Papua New
   Guinea may represent an emergent crisis that warrants further
   investigation. In addition, there is a need for greater understanding of
   the invasive history of pest rodents, so as to integrate biological
   information with management strategies. Ecologically based rodent
   management can be achieved on Pacific Islands, but only after
   significant well funded large-scale projects are established and rodent
   ecologists are trained. We can learn from experiences from other
   locations such as Southeast Asia to guide the way.

AB The black marlin (Istiompax indica) is one of the largest bony fishes in
   the world with females capable of reaching a mass of over 700 kg. This
   highly migratory predator occurs in the tropical regions of the Pacific
   and Indian Oceans, and is the target of regional recreational and
   commercial fisheries. Through the sampling of ichthyoplankton and
   ovaries we provide evidence that the relatively high seasonal abundance
   of black marlin off the Great Barrier Reef is, in fact, a spawning
   aggregation. Furthermore, through the tracking of individual black
   marlin via satellite popup tags, we document the dispersal of adult
   black marlin away from the spawning aggregation, thereby identifying the
   catchment area for this spawning stock. Although tag shedding is an
   issue when studying billfish, we tentatively identify the catchment area
   for this stock of black marlin to extend throughout the Coral Sea,
   including the waters of Papua New Guinea, the Solomon Islands,
   Micronesia, New Caledonia, Kiribati, Vanuatu, Fiji, Tuvalu and Nauru.

AB HARTEMINK AE. 2010. The invasive shrub Piper aduneum in Papua New
   Guinea: a review. Piper aduncum is a shrub native to Central America. It
   is found in most Central and South American countries and also in the
   Caribbean and southern Florida (USA). In Asia and the Pacific, P aduncum
   occurs in Indonesia, Malaysia, Philippines, Papua New Guinea, Solomon
   Islands, Vanuatu, Fiji, Micronesia, American Samoa, Niue, the Marianas,
   Tonga, Samoa, the Cook Islands, Palatt and Hawaii (USA). Piper aduncum
   arrived in Papua New Guinea before the mid-1930s. From the 1970s, it
   started to dominate the secondary fallow vegetation in many parts of the
   humid lowlands. It invaded grassland areas and also appeared in the
   highlands up to 2100 in asl. The seeds are dispersed by birds, bats and
   wind, as well as by logging equipment and in some localities, by
   migrating people. The combination of its vigorous generative
   characteristics (small and abundant seeds), high growth rate and the
   accidental or intentional spreading has resulted ill its presence in
   most provinces of Papua New Guinea. In the 1990s, awareness of the
   spread of P aduncum grew and there was a corresponding increase in
   research interest. from a range of disciplines, e.g. pharmacology,
   agronomy, quarantine, forestry and taxonomy. The invasion of P aduncum
   has affected the farming system and livelihood of many rural people.
   Future research should focus on mapping its extent, and studying its
   agronomic, socio-economic and ecological effects, particularly its
   effect on biodiversity.

AB BACKGROUND: Between 2010 and 2012, the World Health Organization
   Division of Pacific Technical Support led a regional climate change and
   health vulnerability assessment and adaptation planning project, in
   collaboration with health sector partners, in 13 Pacific island
   countries-Cook Islands, Federated States of Micronesia, Fiji, Kiribati,
   Marshall Islands, Nauru, Niue, Palau, Samoa, Solomon Islands, Tonga,
   Tuvalu, and Vanuatu.
   OBJECTIVE: We assessed the vulnerabilities of Pacific island countries
   to the health impacts of climate change and planned adaptation
   strategies to minimize such threats to health.
   METHODS: This assessment involved a combination of quantitative and
   qualitative techniques. The former included descriptive epidemiology,
   time series analyses, Poisson regression, and spatial modeling of
   climate and climate-sensitive disease data, in the few instances where
   this was possible; the latter included wide stakeholder consultations,
   iterative consensus building, and expert opinion. Vulnerabilities were
   ranked using a "likelihood versus impact" matrix, and adaptation
   strategies were prioritized and planned accordingly.
   RESULTS: The highest-priority climate-sensitive health risks in Pacific
   island countries included trauma from extreme weather events,
   heat-related illnesses, compromised safety and security of water and
   food, vector-borne diseases, zoonoses, respiratory illnesses,
   psychosocial ill-health, non-communicable diseases, population
   pressures, and health system deficiencies. Adaptation strategies
   relating to these climate change and health risks could be clustered
   according to categories common to many countries in the Pacific region.
   CONCLUSION: Pacific island countries are among the most vulnerable in
   the world to the health impacts of climate change. This vulnerability is
   a function of their unique geographic, demographic, and socioeconomic
   characteristics combined with their exposure to changing weather
   patterns associated with climate change, the health risks entailed, and
   the limited capacity of the countries to manage and adapt in the face of
   such risks.

AB The sugar industry in the Caribbean is steeped in history dating back to
   the 17th century. It is by far the largest agricultural enterprise in
   the region, generating some 125,000 jobs in direct and indirect
   employment, out of a population of 6 million. At its peak in 1965, the
   industry produced 1.35 million tonnes of sugar. In 2003, the production
   was down to over 710,000 tonnes. This paper describes the structure of
   the sugar industry in the Caribbean countries (Jamaica, Trinidad &
   Tobago, Guyana, Barbados, St. Kitts Nevis and Belize) and critically
   reviews the factors (e.g. world price of sugar) and forces (e.g.
   international trade negotiations), that have shaped and will be shaping
   the industry in the foreseeable future.

   Icacos). Mites from the four islands were either surface sterilized or
   left unsterilized before being cultured on Tap Water Agar (TWA). A total
   of 318 fungal colonies were retrieved. A further 96 mites from Dominica
   were kept on sterile moist filter paper in a humidity chamber and a
   further 85 colonies were isolated. Based on morphological observations
   of all 403 isolates, a sample consisting of 32 colonies (8 %) was sent
   for identification at CABI-UK. Of the 27 fungi positively identified, 15
   isolates belonged to the genera Cladosporium, three to Simplicillium
   spp., and one to Penicillium. Other fungi genera with limited or no
   entomopathogenic potential included: Aspergillus, Cochliobolus,

AB Barbados, St. Vincent, and St. Lucia have joined forces in the world's
   1st regional Contraceptive Social Marketing (CSM) effort -- the
   Caribbean CSM.  The Barbados Family Planning Association (BFPS) is
   overseeing the operation, which begins selling 2 contraceptive pills and
   a condom in early February.  Costs and start-up times were shaved by
   adopting brand names and advertising materials from Jamaica's highly
   successful CSM project.  Jamaica's popular "Panther" condom and "Perle"
   oral contraceptive (OC) are being used by the Caribbean CSM project. 
   Perle's 9-year-old package has been redesigned and the Caribbean CSM
   project also is selling a 2nd, low-dose version called "Perle-LD."  The
   products are manufactured in the US by Syntex as Noriday and Norminest,
   respectively.  But the regional approach's financial gains also had a
   debit side, most notably a tripling of bureaucratic procedures.  Part of
   project difficulties stem from differences among the 3 Caribbean
   countries.  While sharing a common cultural heritage, St. Lucians speak
   a patois dialect in addition to the English prevalent on the other
   islands.  The biggest hurdle was overcoming an economic disparity
   between Barbados and its less affluent neighbors, St. Vincent and St.
   Lucia.  The CSM project decided to try a 2-tier product pricing
   strategy.  In US currency, prices run $1.75 per cycle for both OCs on
   Barbados, but $1.26 on St. Vincent and St. Lucia.  A Panther 3-pack
   costs 75 cents on Barbados and 42 cents on the othe 2 islands.  The
   project is being promoted with generic family planning media
   advertisements.  The project also has held physician orientation
   seminars on each island.  The pilot program will be accompanied by
   retailer training seminars.  In addition the project may introduce a
   spermicidal foaming tablet, once the US Food and Drug Administration
   approvs a new American-made product.  The unique Caribbean CSM project
   may spread an idea as potent as the family planning message.  Its
   success could transmit the regional concept worldwide, helping small
   nations to slow the rate of their population growth.

   factors influencing helminthiasis; (3) identify interventions to improve
   school health. A total of 3,683 children aged 5-12 years attending 27
   primary schools in 13 Pacific Island countries were surveyed along with
   school environmental data. Stool samples were collected from 1996
   children (54.2%) and analysed for ova and helminths. Total prevalence of
   helminthiasis was 32.8%. Anaemia prevalence was 12.4%. Children with
   helminthiasis and anaemia were found to be 8.7 times more likely to be
   stunted and 4.3 times more likely to be underweight than non-anaemic and
   non-infected children. Four significant environmental influences on
   helminthiasis were identified: (1) an inadequate water supply; (2);
   availability of a school canteen; (3) regular water/sanitation
   maintenance regimes; and (4) overcrowded classrooms. Helminthiasis was
   found to be strongly associated with anaemia, stunting and underweight
   and environmental influences identified. Although mass anti-helminthic
   drug administrations (MDA) have been taking place, reinfection is common
   as drug therapy alone is not enough. Programme effectiveness depends
   upon upgrading school environments to include an adequate water supply,
   controlled food preparation/provision, well-maintained water/sanitation
   facilities and class sizes of 30 students or less.

AB This paper investigates the nexus between economic growth and oil price
   in small Pacific Island countries (PICs). Except Papua New Guinea, none
   of the 14 PICs has fossil any fuel resources. Consequently, the other 13
   PICs are totally dependent on oil imports for their economic activities.
   Since PICs have limited foreign exchange earning capacities, as they
   have a very narrow range of exports and are highly dependent on foreign
   aid, high oil prices in recent months have seriously tested their
   economic resilience. This paper applies the ARDL bounds testing
   methodology to four selected PICs, Samoa, Solomon Islands, Tonga and
   Vanuatu, which have consistent and reliable time series of data, with a
   view to assess the impact of oil price on economic growth. The findings
   are that oil price, gross domestic product and international reserve are
   cointegrated in all the four PICs. Further, both in the long and short
   runs, we observe that there is a uni-directional relationship as
   causality linkage runs only from oil price and international reserves to
   economic growth. The paper makes some policy recommendations. (C) 2009

AB One island group suggested to be an exception to the species-area
   Relationship is the Vanuatu Archipelago, a group of 13 large and 80
   small islands in the southwest Pacific Ocean. To test the hypothesis
   that the lizard fauna of the Vanuatu Archipelago does not meet the
   predictions of the species-area relationship, and thus is depauperate,
   we compare diversity among several island groups in the southwest
   Pacific: Fiji, the Loyalty Islands, New Caledonia, Samoa, the Solomon
   Islands, Tonga, and Vanuatu. We found that the lizard diversity of
   Vanuatu meets the pattern of diversity predicted by the species-area
   relationship. The Solomon Islands, the largest and least isolated
   oceanic archipelago considered, has the greatest species diversity and
   endemism of the oceanic islands. Inclusion or exclusion of island groups
   based on factors such as geologic history or faunal source affects the
   strength of the relationship between diversity, area, and history of
   emergence, and influences perceptions of diversity within individual
   archipelagos. In addition to island size, factors such evolutionary time
   scale, speciation, and archipelago complexity influence species richness

AB Freshwater resources are a high-priority issue in the Pacific region.
   Water shortage is a serious problem in many small island states, and
   many depend heavily on rainwater as the source of their water. Lack of
   safe water supplies is an important factor in diarrheal illness. There
   have been no previous studies looking specifically at the relationship
   between climate variability and diarrhea in the Pacific region. We
   carried out two related studies to explore the potential relationship
   between climate variability and the incidence of diarrhea in the Pacific
   Islands. In the first study, we examined the average annual rates of
   diarrhea in adults, as well as temperature and water availability from
   1986 to 1994 for 18 Pacific Island countries. There was a positive
   association between annual average temperature and the rate of diarrhea
   reports, and a negative association between water availability and
   diarrhea races. In the second study, we examined diarrhea notifications
   in Fiji in relation to estimates of temperature and rainfall, using
   Poisson regression analysis of monthly data for 1978-1998. There were
   positive associations between diarrhea reports and temperature and
   between diarrhea reports and extremes of rainfall. These results are
   consistent with previous research and suggest that global climate change
   is likely to exacerbate diarrheal illness in many Pacific Island
   countries.

AB The Indo-Pacific labrid fish genus Labropsis is characterized by having:
   thick plicate lips which form a tubular structure when mouth is closed;
   2 pairs of recurved canine teeth anteriorly in upper jaw (the 2nd pair
   usually half the size of the first); a canine at corner of mouth; no
   teeth along side of jaw; dorsal rays IX, 10-12; anal rays III, 9-11;
   pectoral rays usually 14; and a continuous lateral line of 27-49 scales.
   It consists of 6 spp: L. manabei Schmidt from the Ryukyu Islands, Taiwan
   and Philippines and 5 new species: L. alleni from Micronesia and the
   Indo-Malayan region, readily separated by having 27 lateral-line scales;
   L. polynesica from islands of French Polynesia and the Cook Islands,
   distinctive in having the 2nd pair of upper canine teeth nearly as large
   as the first and 43-47 lateral-line scales; L. xanthonota, which ranges
   from East Africa to central Oceania, with 46-49 lateral-line scales, the
   male with an emarginate caudal fin (true also of L. polynesica); L
   micronesica, from islands of Micronesia, with 35-40 lateral-line scales;
   and L. australis from the Solomon, Samoa, Fiji, Loyalty and Tonga
   Islands, New Hebrides and Great Barrier Reef [Australia] which is
   closely related to L. micronesica, having the same scale and finray
   counts, but differing in the suborbital scales not extending as far
   anteriorly in the shorter 9th dorsal spine, and in having a large black
   spot at the pectoral base containing a dorsal orange-red spot and a
   smaller ventral one of the same color (pectoral base of L. micronesica
   entirely orange-red). L. manabei, a close relative of L. micronesica and
   L. australis, differs in having one fewer dorsal soft rays (11) and one
   fewer anal soft rays (10). The species of Labropsis are all small coral
   reef fishes (rarely exceeding 100 mm SL). They are proterogynous
   hermaphrodites, commencing mature life as females. Adults appear to feed
   principally on coral polyps. The striped juveniles have been observed
   cleaning other reef fishes.

AB Prenatal exposures to legacy persistent organic pollutants (POPs) such
   as polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and dioxin-like compounds (DLC), as
   well as polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDE), were analyzed in pregnant
   women from 10 Caribbean countries. A total of 438 samples were collected
   and descriptive statistics calculated and compared to comparable
   Canadian Health Measure Survey (CHMS) and U.S. National Health and
   Nutritional Examination Survey (NHANES) datasets. Maternal POPs blood
   concentrations were found to be generally relatively low in the
   Caribbean samples compared with the U.S. and Canada datasets. Evidence
   of exposure to DLC and PBDE was established. DLC levels ranged from a
   geometric mean low of 3.96 pg/g lipids in Antigua and Barbuda to a high
   of 11.4 pg/g lipids in St. Lucia. Several of the PBDEs (15, 17, 25, 28,
   33,100) were detected in less than 60% of the country's samples. For
   PBDE-47, significantly higher levels were found in Bermuda, while
   Jamaica recorded a significantly low level. The overall calculated
   concentration of PBDE-47 for the Caribbean (5.33 mu g/kg lipids) was
   significantly lower than the concentrations measured for the U.S. (10.83
   mu g/kg lipids) and Canada (23.90 mu g/kg lipids). This study confirms
   that prenatal expose to multiple environmental chemicals is taking place
   in the Caribbean and highlights the need to implement surveillance
   programs that continuously monitor, intervene, and evaluate the levels
   of these toxic environmental contaminants to ensure that they are
   reduced as much as possible and that the health risk to humans, in
   particular the unborn child, are minimized. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All

AB Mikania micrantha Kunth, commonly known as bitter vine, American rope,
   or mile-a-minute, is a rapidly growing vine, native to tropical America.
   Mikania micrantha is present in 20 Pacific island countries and
   territories, including Australia, the Cook Islands, Fiji, French
   Polynesia, Micronesia, Papua New Guinea, Samoa, Solomon Islands, and
   Vanuatu. A CLIMEX model based on native distribution of M. micrantha
   suggests that most of the islands in the Pacific, southern Asia, and
   parts of southern and central Africa are climatically suitable for M.
   micrantha, leaving these areas vulnerable to new or further incursions.
   Its rapid spread is a threat to both natural and agricultural
   environments, where it kills or reduces growth of preferred species,
   severely impacting on biodiversity and production. Large numbers of
   wind-dispersed seeds and ability to propagate vegetatively from stem
   fragments facilitate rapid invasion. Management of M. micrantha is
   difficult. Several postemergence herbicides exhibit some efficacy, but
   manual control via hand pulling and slashing is more commonly practiced.
   However, slashing may result in increased growth from fragments, and
   plants may regenerate from roots after herbicide application. Cultural
   techniques such as fallowing or burning may also help limit spread.
   Competitors that produce ample vegetation such as sweet potato (Ipomoea
   batatas [L.] Lam.) may be effective for suppression in some situations.
   Various studies have shown that Mikania micrantha exhibits some genetic
   diversity across biotypes encountered in southern Asia. Although little
   is currently known about its population genetics across the South
   Pacific, more information will undoubtedly facilitate potential for
   future biological control. A rust pathogen, Puccinia spegazzinii,
   introduced from South America was established in Taiwan in 2008, in
   Papua New Guinea and Fiji in 2009, and in Vanuatu in 2012 for biological
   control. The dodder Cuscuta campestris Yuncker has also shown some
   efficacy against M. micrantha, but its status as a known pest limits its
   use as a biological control agent. Recent research into the mikania wilt
   virus as a biocontrol agent is in its infancy, and it is too early to
   recommend it to assist with the management of M. micrantha. Given the
   difficulty of controlling M. micrantha once established and the early
   stages of research into biological control, high priority must be given
   to preventing colonization of Pacific islands where M. micrantha is not
   yet present, through early detection and rapid response to new
   incursions.

AB Although the Caribbean region is recognized as a major biodiversity
   hotspot, many megadiverse groups remain taxonomically understudied. The
   ornate spiders of the genus Spintharus Hentz, 1850 (Theridiidae,
   Araneae) are a good example where taxonomic boundaries have remained
   unclear. The genus shows profuse habitus and genitalic variation in the
   Caribbean and has distinct colour patterns that rapidly degrade in
   ethanol. The leading theridiid taxonomist of the last six decades
   (Herbert W. Levi) therefore concluded that the morphological diversity
   of Caribbean Spintharus was, with the evidence available at the time,
   best characterized as intraspecific variation. The first molecular
   study, however, rejected the 'single widespread species' hypothesis,
   rather indicating multiple short-range endemics. This paper describes
   and diagnoses 15 new species based on the combination of molecular and
   morphological data, including S. davidattenboroughi sp. nov., S.
   barackobamai sp. nov., S. michelleobamaae sp. nov., S. davidbowiei sp.
   nov., S. leonardodicaprioi sp. nov. and S. bemiesandersi sp. nov. Much
   Caribbean diversity may be similarly 'hidden' by existing taxonomical
   hypotheses; clearly, more focus is needed on the taxonomy of megadiverse
   groups. The implications of integrated taxonomy dramatically alter
   conservation biology when a single widespread species is instead found
   to represent multiple short-range endemics. Our goal here is thus to
   update Spintharus taxonomy and discuss the implications of the newly
   found diversity for both biodiversity research and conservation.

   preservation and other critical requirements of the national populace.
   This first paper in this Special Section aims to present the economic
   contributions, types of fisheries and common fishing practices/gears,
   and the institutional set-up and the national development plans and
   policies related to the fisheries sector in four Pacific countries
   namely, Fiji, Solomon Islands, Vanuatu, and Timor-Leste. The paper
   discusses the common issues and the collective action surrounding the

AB AimTo determine statistical relationships between the prevalence of
   haemosporidian (malaria) parasites and the abundance of avian host
   populations across islands in the Lesser Antilles.
   LocationThirteen islands in the Lesser Antilles, from Grenada in the
   south to St Kitts in the north.
   MethodsBirds were captured by mist net and small blood samples were
   taken for polymerase chain reaction and DNA sequencing analysis of
   haemosporidian parasite infections. Similarities between islands with
   respect to geographical distance, avian host assemblages and
   haemosporidian parasite assemblages were compared by partial Mantel
   tests. Relative abundances of avian host populations across islands were
   compared to the relative abundances of common haemosporidian lineages by
   stepwise regression.
   ResultsPopulations of parasite lineages were more heterogeneously
   distributed than were host populations across the islands; parasite
   lineages frequently shift between hosts on different islands and exhibit
   range disjunctions. Relative population sizes of two widespread and
   common species of bird in the Lesser Antilles, the bananaquit Coereba
   flaveola and the black-faced grassquit Tiaris bicolor, were negatively
   related to the relative abundances of two parasite lineages, OZ01
   (Plasmodium sp.) and OZ12 (Haemoproteus sp.), although the latter
   parasite was not recovered from either host. Positive associations
   between populations of Elaenia martinica and the relative abundance of
   three parasite lineages in populations of Vireo altiloquus additionally
   suggest the possibility of apparent competition between avian species
   mediated through haemosporidian parasites.
   Main conclusionsThe results of these analyses are consistent with a
   strong influence of some avian haemosporidian parasites on populations
   of their hosts, including indirect interactions through apparent
   competition. In addition, the heterogeneity of host-parasite
   associations between islands suggests an evolutionarily dynamic system
   that is consistent with phases of host expansion and contraction,
   commonly known as the taxon cycle.

X4 Resumen Esta ponencia trata la contribución hecha a la lengua y la
   cultura caribeñas por los inmigrantes hindúes, los cuales emigraron al
   Caribe por medio de contratos de aprendizaje con los colonizadores
   británicos durante las últimas cinco décadas del siglo XIX. La migración
   hindú se realizó después de la Emancipación de los esclavos africanos,
   quienes tradicionalmente cultivaron el azúcar en las plantaciones de los
   varios territorios caribeños. Su contribución ha sido muy valiosa y
   sigue siéndolo, sobre todo en las áreas de la lengua, la cultura y la
   vida diaria caribeñas. La influencia de los hindúes se manifestó mucho
   en los más grandes territorios de habla inglesa a causa de que las
   plantaciones en aquellos países, como Guyana y Trinidad y Tobago y,
   también, hasta cierto punto Jamaica, fueron mucho más grandes que las de
   las islas más pequeñas como Barbados, Antigua y Santa Lucía, por
   ejemplo. Han influido significativamente en la demografía de los dos
   territorios, Guyana y Trinidad, donde han llegado a ser la mayor parte
   de la población y también en la vida política de todos los dos países.
   Para demostrar su gran influencia en el léxico, se presenta una muestra
   de las palabras que han introducido en las variedades del inglés de
   Guyana y Trinidad, en las áreas de la comida, la religión, las fiestas y
   la vida diaria.

   Alpheopsis Coutiere, 1897 characterised by the presence of at least one
   strong carina on the dorsal surface of the carapace. Alpheopsis trigona
   (Rathbun, 1901) is redescribed based on the holotype from Puerto Rico
   and additional material from US Virgin Islands and Florida. Two new
   species closely related to A. trigona, viz. A. paratrigona sp. nov. and
   A. gotrina sp. nov., are described, the first based on material from
   several localities in the tropical western Atlantic, and the second from
   the Pacific coast of Panama and Colombia. The three species together
   form a distinctive transisthmian clade within Alpheopsis, the A. trigona
   species complex, characterised by the presence of several strong
   longitudinal carinae on the carapace and very distinctive colour
   pattern. A more distantly related species, A. aristoteles sp. nov.,
   characterised by the presence of only one strong mid-dorsal carina in
   the anterior region of the carapace, is described based on material from
   Sao Tome Island in the tropical eastern Atlantic.

   from deep (>60 m) coral-reef habitat in the western Pacific by divers
   using mixed-gas closed-circuit rebreather gear. Two of the five new
   species (C. abyssus and C. circumaurea) are each described from
   specimens taken at a single locality within the Caroline Islands (Palau
   and Yap, respectively); one (C. degruyi) is described from specimens
   collected or observed throughout the Caroline Islands, and two (C.
   brevirostris and C. earina) are described from specimens collected from
   several localities throughout the Caroline Islands, Fiji, and Vanuatu.
   All five species can easily be distinguished from other known Chromis,
   and from each other, on the basis of color and morphology. These new
   species represent the first five scientific names prospectively
   registered in the official ICZN ZooBank registry(6). Moreover, the
   electronic online edition of this document has been specially formatted
   with many embedded links to additional resources available online via

   transcriptase (RT)/ribonuclease H (RNaseH) and the C-terminal coat
   protein (CP)-coding regions from Taro bacilliform virus (TaBV) isolates
   collected throughout the Pacific Islands. When the RT/RNaseH-coding
   region of 22 TaBV isolates from Fiji, French Polynesia, New Caledonia,
   Papua New Guinea (PNG), Samoa, Solomon Islands and Vanuatu was examined,
   maximum variability at the nucleotide and amino acid level was 22.9% and
   13.6%, respectively. Within the CP-coding region of 13 TaBV isolates
   from Fiji, New Caledonia, PNG, Samoa and the Solomon Islands, maximum
   variability at the nucleotide and amino acid level was 30.7% and 19.5%,
   respectively. Phylogenetic analysis showed that TaBV isolates from the
   Solomon Islands showed greatest variability while those from New
   Caledonia and PNG showed least variability. Based on the sequences of
   the TaBV RT/RNaseH-coding region, we have developed a PCR-based
   diagnostic test that specifically detects all known TaBV isolates.
   Preliminary indexing has revealed that TaBV is widespread throughout
   Pacific Island countries. A sequence showing approximately 50%
   nucleotide identity to TaBV in the RT/RNaseH-coding region was also
   detected in all taro samples tested. The possibility that this may
   represent either an integrated sequence or the genome of an additional
   badnavirus infecting taro is discussed.

AB Forests and trees play an important role in the lives of Pacific
   islanders but significant loss of biodiversity has become a major
   concern recently due to destructive human activities associated with
   mining, agricultural clearing and commercial logging. The South Pacific
   Regional Initiative on Forest Genetic Resources (SPRIG) projects
   implemented from 1997 to 2006, with participation by Fiji, Samoa, the
   Solomon Islands, Vanuatu and Tonga, laid the foundation for the
   conservation and management of forest genetic resources in the Pacific.
   The projects have three major components: conservation, tree improvement
   and institutional development. Since 2006, the Forests and Trees
   Programme of the Land Resources Division of the Secretariat of the
   Pacific Community (SPC) has undertaken the mandate initiated by SPRIG
   projects to promote the value of forest genetic resources, including
   breadfruit, and their fundamental importance to sustainable development
   for all of its member countries in the Pacific.

PD JAN 2012
PY 2012
AB Strumigenys rogeri EMERY, 1890 (Subfamily Myrmicinae, Tribe Dacetini) is
   a very small ant (total length 2.5 mm) that nests in and under dead wood
   and preys on tiny soil arthropods. Strumigenys rogeri has spread to many
   parts of the world through human commerce. However, because S. rogeri
   workers are so small and slow moving, and they become motionless when
   disturbed, most people, including field biologists, remain unaware of
   their presence. To examine the spread of S. rogeri, I compiled specimen
   records from > 400 sites worldwide. 1 documented the earliest known S.
   rogeri records for 67 geographic areas (countries, island groups, major
   Caribbean islands, US states, and Canadian provinces), including many
   areas for which I found no previously published records: Antigua,
   Austral Islands, Barbados, British Virgin Islands, Comoro Islands,
   Grenada, Guadeloupe, Iles Eparses, Martinique, Nevis, Palau,
   Philippines, St Kitts, St Lucia, St Martin, and Tanzania.
   Strumigenys rogeri apparently originated in tropical Africa, where its
   closest relatives all live, but it has become widespread on tropical
   islands of the Indo-Pacific and the West Indies, and in peninsular
   Florida. Outside of Africa and Florida, there are only a small number of
   continental records of S. rogeri, including a few from South and Central
   America and just one from continental Asia, in peninsular Malaysia. It
   is unclear whether S. rogeri has not yet spread to these continental
   areas, whether continental ants have competitively excluded S. rogeri,
   or whether these ants have been simply overlooked in surveys of diverse
   continental faunae. There is little information on what impact S. rogeri
   may be having on the native mesofauna in its exotic range.

   biodiversity and biogeography of the barnacles of the genus Waikalasma
   Buckeridge, 1983 (Thoracica: Waikalasmatidae Ross and Newman, 2001),
   which inhabit the deep sea of the Southwest Pacific. Previous studies
   reported only a single living species, W. boucheti Buckeridge, 1996,
   from Vanuatu. In the present study, the collections by French deep-sea
   expeditions off New Caledonia (NORFOLK 1 & 2, EBISCO, SMIB 2, SMIB 4,
   SMIB 8, BIOCAL, MUSORSTOM 6, MUSORSTOM 4, MUSORSTOM 5, BATHUS 2), the
   Solomon Islands (SALOMON 1), Vanuatu (BOA1) and Papua New Guinea
   (BIOPAPUA) yielded specimens of Waikalasma species from 500 to 800 m
   depth. From molecular (DNA barcode region cytochrome c oxidase subunit I
   (COI) and 12S gene) and morphological analysis, a new species Waikalasma
   dianajonesae sp. nov., and W. boucheti were identified. From molecular
   phylogenetic analysis, sequence divergence in the DNA barcode region
   between W. dianajonesae sp nov. and W. boucheti reached > 10%.
   Waikalasma dianajonesae sp. nov. differs from W. boucheti in the number
   and size of imbricating plates on the shell and the shape of the tergum.
   Waikalasma dianajonesae sp. nov. and W. boucheti exhibit sympatric
   biogeographical distributions in the Southwest Pacific. Waikalasma
   dianajonesae was found in the waters of Papua New Guinea and Solomon
   Island, whilst W. boucheti was collected from Papua New Guinea, Vanuatu

AB From 3200 to 2850 cal BP (1250-900 BCE), the Lapita people of the
   Bismarck Archipelago (Papua New Guinea) undertook voyages eastward that
   led to their colonization of the eastern outer Solomon Islands, Vanuatu,
   New Caledonia, Fiji, Tonga and Samoa. The earliest (Lapita) settlements
   in Fiji were along the Rove Peninsula in southwest Viti Levu Island. At
   the time of colonization, sea level was 1.5 m higher than today. The
   Rove Peninsula was then a smaller island off the coast of larger Viti
   Levu, with a broad, fringing reef along its windward coasts, which was
   probably the main attraction for Lapita colonizers. As elsewhere during
   Lapita times in the western tropical Pacific Islands, settlement choice
   for the initial colonizers of the Fiji Islands was at one level driven
   by site access, at another by the presence of broad, fringing coral
   reefs suitable for marine foraging.
   The earliest settlement along the Rove Peninsula was at Bourewa,
   occupied first in 3050 cal BP (1100 BCE), where people lived in houses
   on stilt platforms built along the axis of a subtidal sand barrier; on
   one side was a broad coral reef, on the other a partly-enclosed tidal
   inlet. There is no evidence that the Bourewa settlers practised
   horticulture or agriculture at this time, their subsistence being
   predominantly marine foraging. After some 300 years of following this
   subsistence strategy, the inhabitants of Bourewa responded to sea-level
   fall and the arrival of cultivars (of taro and yam) by including
   horticulture. As sea level fell further, a total of 550 mm during the
   Lapita era, the tidal inlet dried up and marine-food resources
   diminished to a point where the natural environment of the Rove
   Peninsula could no longer sustain its Lapita inhabitants. All Lapita
   sites in the area were abandoned about 2500 cal BP (550 BCE), at the
   same time as the Lapita culture, marked by the end of dentate-pottery
   manufacture, came to an end in Fiji.

AB Amblyomma variegatum, the Tropical Bont Tick (TBT), is the principal
   vector of heartwater and is associated with dermatophilosis, major
   causes of losses in animal production and mortality in Caribbean
   livestock. From 1995 to 2007, the Caribbean Amblyomma Programme
   (CAP)supported treatment and surveillance activities in 11 islands of
   the Eastern Caribbean with an initial objective of eradicating TBT. In
   addition to control activities, Surveillance data were collected between
   1997 and 2006 in a unique regional database. We report the analysis of
   the surveillance data from four islands (Nevis, St Kitts, St Lucia, and
   Barbados) where control and surveillance followed the initial protocol
   and where enough data were collected. We describe the evolution of TBT
   infestation levels and the efforts carried out throughout the
   surveillance period. Logistic regression identified factors associated
   with herds found infested with TBT. Overall, treatment programmes were
   associated with a decrease in proportion of TBT-infested farms. High
   surveillance efforts were carried out throughout the 1997-2007 period
   for all island of interest, but inadequate level of surveillance was
   observed in several quarters especially for St Kitts. Third quarter of
   the year, as indication of adult TBT seasonality on livestock, was
   significantly associated with the risk of detecting TBT in Nevis and St
   Kitts livestock farms. Also, presence of cattle in Nevis farms was shown
   associated with an increasing probability of farms being declared
   TBT-infested. Outcomes of these analyses provide basis for
   recommendations to improve future national and regional control and
   surveillance activities. This analysis demonstrates the usefulness of
   long term and adequate surveillance data for control programmes and
   identification of factors associated with risk of having infested herds.

   new taxa are fully described and figured. Previously described taxa are

   found in coral reefs and other hard-bottomed, shallow, tropical waters.
   An unusual tropical relic, A. tangaroa n.sp., is described from cold
   waters in the Bass Strait, Australia. Current species distributions and
   information probably reflect collecting bias as many areas remain
   uncollected. Cladistic analysis of the Anamixidae proved informative in

AB The paper analyses agricultural risks and risk management in selected
   Small Island Developing States which are part of the African Caribbean
   Pacific country group. Focus is on the value chains of fruits,
   vegetables and spices. A survey was conducted in Grenada, Jamaica, Fiji
   and Vanuatu, aimed at identifying sources of risk which are most
   important to value chain stakeholders; the nature and quality of
   existing and potential risk management mechanisms; and the possibility
   of enhancing them in view of improving the functioning of the value
   chains. The sample included farmers, processors, traders, retailers,
   extension agents, Government officials and private services providers.
   Results reveal limited ability to handle price and production
   variability, clue to lack of both horizontal and vertical co-ordination
   along value chains, reduced use of support services, notably credit and
   underinvestment in equipment. In addition, lack of demand contributes to
   make insurance markets incomplete and characterised by undersupply or
   lack of customised products. Promoting light forms of vertical and
   horizontal co-ordination, such as production contracts and producers'
   associations, as well as value chain-based credit and finance may
   address some of the issues highlighted. (C) 2010 200x Food and

   capacity. Drawing on the concept of communities of practice, this paper
   seeks to operationalize an understanding of how the social relations
   that underpin smallholder-related value chains can be better supported
   to enhance resilience. Case studies from the Caribbean are then used to
   illustrate how a community of practice approach to value chain
   development might facilitate the formation of social capital. (C) 2015

   products, biomass, solar energy and wind power. Solar energy was
   introduced in Kiribati in the early 1980s (Wade H. Survey of RESCO
   projects - prepared for OPRET, Fiji Department of Energy, 2003; p. 36).
   Currently, it makes a very insignificant (less than 1%) contribution to

   Environment Programme (SPREP). Pacific Islands Renewable Energy Project
   (PIREP) - Pacific Regional Energy Assessment (PREA) 2004. Kiribati

   in the form of solar photovoltaic (PV) technologies for the provision of
   lighting and electricity.
   This study examines the role of PV technologies in the sustainable
   development process in Kiribati, with particular reference to remote
   atoll communities. Initial results from on-site surveys carried out are
   reported in this paper. These surveys have sought to identify the
   reasons why people use or do not use PV systems. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

AB We present a conservation index based upon the interaction of the size
   of terrestrial protected areas, remaining forest habitat, deforestation
   rates, and biological richness to identify conservation potentials,
   threats, and strategies for 23 Indo-Pacific countries. This conservation
   potential/threat index shows that four of the largest and most
   species-rich countries-China, Indonesia, India, and Thailand-contain 82%
   of the region's large reserves (more than 1000 km2) and 86% of the
   region's area designated for protection The skewed regional distribution
   and small number of large reserves per country call for the expansion of
   existing protected areas and, where possible, the establishment of new
   parks and transfrontier reserves. The index indicates high potential for
   conservation efforts in Papua New Guinea, Laos, Myanmar, New Caledonia,
   Vanuatu, and the Solomon Islands, which have a high percentage of
   remaining forested habitats, high species richness, or endemism, but
   which lack comprehensive protected area systems. The index also predicts
   that if current rates of deforestation continue, only Brunei, Bhutan,
   Indonesia Taiwan, and Malaysia will bave adequate proportions of their
   respective land areas under some form of protection while still
   maintaining a minimal percentage (20% or more) of forested habitat
   outside reserves. Based on the regional analysis we identify priority
   countries for investment in biodiversity conservation, and we evaluate
   funding responses earmarked for those countries. We then show bow the
   index can be adapted to different geographical scales using examples
   from Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines.

AB Similar to many coastal or island countries, the waters around St. Kitts
   and Nevis, an island nation in the Eastern Caribbean, are home to
   multiple, cumulative, and often conflicting uses of the sea. Marine
   spatial planning and marine zoning hold great promises for addressing
   and balancing a number of marine management objectives in St. Kitts and
   Nevis under a common framework. We outline the key activities that led
   to the development of a draft marine zoning design for St. Kitts and
   Nevis, and discuss outcomes of the planning process and possible next
   steps towards implementation of a marine zoning plan. The key activities
   were focused around: 1) engaging stakeholders; 2) establishing clear
   objectives; 3) building an information base that spatially represents
   marine uses (i.e., a multi-objective geodatabase); 4) generating tools
   to assist stakeholders and decision makers in generating a zoning design
   and considering options and tradeoffs (i.e., decision support products);
   and 5) outlining the location of zones via a participatory process. The
   vision and foundation for marine zoning we outline here can continue to
   be leveraged by the citizen of St. Kitts and Nevis and serve as a model
   in other places engaged in similar efforts. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All

AB Domestic milk production in the major CARICOM states appears to be in
   crisis, with shrinking domestic production and increasing milk imports.
   This paper therefore investigates the impact of trade liberalization on
   domestic milk production and imports in Jamaica, Trinidad and Tobago and
   Barbados and determines trade factors that influence changes in these
   variables. The study demonstrates the dominance of dairy imports into
   CARICOM from New Zealand and the EU and the significant effects of trade
   liberalization in causing structural changes in domestic milk production
   and imports in the cases of Barbados and Jamaica. Changes in GDP per
   capita highly influence changes in milk imports for the three countries
   and for Jamaica also the price of imported powdered milk. The Nestle
   countries, Jamaica, and Trinidad and Tobago show greater declines in
   milk production than Barbados, therefore further research is recommended
   on the role of Nestle in the Caribbean milk industry.

AB Weaver ants (Oecophylla spp.) are conspicuous arboreal ants, which build
   distinctive nests in trees. In many regions, people use weaver ants for
   food, medicine, and/or as biological control agents. There are two
   recognized species of weaver ants: Oecophylla longinoda (Latreille,
   1802) in Africa and Oecophylla smaragdina (Fabricius, 1775) in Asia,
   Australia, and the Western Pacific. Here, I mapped the geographic
   distribution of O. smaragdina based on > 2700 site records from 21
   countries: Australia, Bangladesh, Bhutan, Brunei, Burma (Myanmar),
   Cambodia, China, India, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Nepal, Palau, Papua
   New Guinea, Philippines, Singapore, Solomon Islands, Sri Lanka,
   Thailand, Timor Leste, and Vietnam. The vast majority of O. smaragdina
   records come from areas with Tropical (Group A) climates according to
   the Koppen-Geiger system: rainforest (Af), monsoon (Am), and savanna
   (Aw). However, > 250 records come from areas classified on the map as
   having a Subtropical (Group C) climates, mostly in the Himalayan
   foothills of India and Nepal, southern China, northern Vietnam, and the
   southern coast of Queensland, Australia. Almost all these sites are
   classified as dry winter subtropical climate (Cwa). A few O. smaragdina
   sites are classified as having Arid (Group B) climates, all from warm
   semi-arid (BSh) areas. This range map based on site records corrects
   inaccuracies in earlier published range maps.

BP 45
EP 60
PD 1985
PY 1985
AB In December, 1981, the Government of the Netherlands conducted
   evaluation studies of perinatal health care in the 6 Caribbean countries
   of Antigua, the Bahamas, Barbados, Dominica, Saint Lucia, and St.
   Vincnet.  In recent years, the governments of the 6 countries expressed
   their concerns about the need to improve perinatal health care and about
   the limited funds, health facilities, and health manpower available for
   meeting this need.  Data for the studies were collected during visits to
   the 6 countries and consisted of availble vital statistics and hospital
   records collected by local physicians and chief nurses.  Since 70%-95%
   of the deliveries in these countries occurred in hospitals, hospital
   data were used to assess the level of perinatal mortality.  Perinatal
   death rates for the 6 countries ranged from 29/1000 live births to
   38/1000 live births.  When stillbirths and neonatal death rates were
   examined separately, there was considerable variation between countries.
   Stillbirth rates ranged from 23.4-13.6/1000 live births and neonatal
   death rates ranged from 9.9-22.5/1000 live births.  These differences
   probably reflected classification problems rather than actual
   differences.  Although there was considerable variation in per capita
   income levels in the 6 countries (US$380-US$2620) these differences did
   not appear to be associated with differences in perinatal death rates. 
   Average birth weights for the 6 countries ranged from 3000 gm to 3150
   gm, and the average for all 6 countries combined was 3100 gm.  The
   incidence of low birth weights (2500 gm or less) ranged from 5.9% in
   Dominica to 11% in Barbados.  The major causes of perinatal death were
   complications resulting from anoxia or hypoxia, prematurity
   complications, and neonatal infections.  Infants who survive these
   conditions frequently develop handicaps.  Average breastfeeding duration
   ranged from 1 month in the Bahamas to 7 months in St. Vincent.  Bottle
   feeding is common and generally begins early.  Mistaken beliefs about
   the nutritional inadequacies of breast milk as well as the promotion of
   formulas contribute toward the relatively low rate and short duration of
   breastfeeding in these countries.  Specific recommendations for
   improving perinatal health care in each of the 6 countries were
   provided.  Recommendations relevant to most of the countries were 1) to
   improve the level of health knowledge among the general public, 2) to
   provide additional training for all health personnel working in the
   perinatal health care field, 3) to upgrade and improve the maintenance
   of basic equipment for resuscitating newborns, 4) to promote the early
   detection and improve the management of jaundice, 5) to distribute free
   supplies of anti-D-globulin for treating Rh-negative mothers, 6) to
   develop linkages between perinatal health care facilities and postpartum
   health care facilities to ensure continuity of care for each infant, 7)
   to develop a system for detecting and managing high risk pregnancies and
   infants at high risk, 8) to promote funding for tropical perinatology,
   and 9) to develop a perinatal technology appropriate to conditions in
   these countries.

AB In coming decades, sea level rise associated with climate change will
   make some communities uninhabitable. Managed retreat, or planned
   relocation, is a proactive response prior to catastrophic necessity.
   Managed retreat has disruptive health, sociocultural, and economic
   impacts on communities that relocate. Health impacts include mental
   health, social capital, food security, water supply, sanitation,
   infectious diseases, injury, and health care access. We searched
   peer-reviewed and gray literature for reports on small island or coastal
   communities at various stages of relocation primarily due to sea level
   rise. We reviewed these reports to identify public health impacts and
   barriers to relocation. We identified eight relevant small communities
   in the USA (Alaska, Louisiana, and Washington), Panama, Fiji, Papua New
   Guinea, Solomon Islands, and Vanuatu. Affected populations range from 60
   to 2700 persons and are predominantly indigenous people who rely on
   subsistence fishing and agriculture. Few reports directly addressed
   public health issues. While some relocations were successful, barriers
   to relocation in other communities include place attachment, potential
   loss of livelihoods, and lack of funding, suitable land, community
   consensus, and governance procedures. Further research is needed on the
   health impacts of managed retreat and how to facilitate population
   resilience. Studies could include surveillance of health indicators
   before and after communities relocate due to sea level rise, drought, or
   other environmental hazards. Lessons learned may inform relocation of
   both small and large communities affected by climate change.

AB Identifying rates of change in the abundance of sea cucumbers under
   differing management regimes is fundamental to estimating commercial
   yields, identifying ecological interactions and facilitating management.
   Here, we review the status of sea cucumber stocks from a range of
   Pacific Island countries (Samoa, Tonga, Palau, Fiji and Papua New
   Guinea), some of which have had a moratorium on exports for up to a
   decade. We use a time-series approach to look at variation in sea
   cucumber presence, coverage and density from survey and re-survey data.
   Results give an appreciation of variation between 'high' status (less
   impacted) and depleted stocks. Survey data show marked declines in
   coverage and abundance as a result of artisanal fishing activity, and
   although species groups were not lost at a country level, local
   extirpation and range restriction was noted. Resilience and 'recovery'
   following cessation of fishing varied greatly, both among locations and
   among the species targeted. Worryingly, even after extended periods of
   moratorium, the density of some species was markedly low. In many cases,
   the densities were too low for commercial fishing, and may be at a level
   where the effective population size is constrained due to 'Allee'
   affects. From these results, we suggest that management regimes
   presently employed are generally not well aligned with the level of
   response to fishing mortality that can be expected from sea cucumber
   stocks. New adaptive, precautionary approaches to management are
   suggested, which would allow more timely interventions to be made, while
   refined information on stock dynamics is sought.

   with public service improvements (housing, safe water, sanitation) and
   changes in demography (urbanization) and economy (change from sugarcane

   areas would be helpful for control. Elimination of schistosomiasis
   appears achievable in the Caribbean. However, a regional surveillance
   and monitoring program is needed to verify elimination in the various
   localities and identify and monitor areas still endemic or at risk.

TI Using reference nutrient density goals with Food Balance Sheet data to

AB Background. Collection of nationwide food consumption data at the
   individual level is the preferred option for planning fortification
   programs. However, such data are seldom collected in low-income
   countries. In contrast, Food Balance Sheets (FBS), published annually
   for approximately 180 countries, may provide a source of national data
   for program planning.
   Objective. To explore the use of micronutrient densities from FBS data
   to identify likely deficits for eight micronutrients in national diets.
   Methods. Micronutrient densities in the daily available food supply per
   capita were calculated from the micronutrient contents of 95 food
   commodities in 17 Western Pacific Region countries. Densities were
   compared with reference nutrient density goals developed to ensure that
   at least 95% of individuals, irrespective of life-stage group, are
   likely to have adequate intakes.
   Results. Of the eight micronutrients, Cambodia and Korea D.P.R. had
   likely deficits for six; China, Fiji, Kiribati, Korea Republic, Lao
   P.D.R., Philippines, Solomon Islands, Vanuatu, and Viet Nam had likely
   deficits for five; Brunei Darussalam, Malaysia, Mongolia, New Zealand,
   and Papua New Guinea had likely deficits for four; and New Caledonia had
   likely deficits for three. The most frequent deficits were for iron,
   zinc, and calcium (all countries), followed by vitamin B-2 and vitamin A
   (n = 13), vitamin B-1 (n = 2), and vitamin B-12 (n = 1).
   Conclusions. The nutrient density approach could be applied to FBS data
   for ranking countries according to likely micronutrient deficits, but it
   provides no information on distribution of nutrient supply for
   fortification program planning. The approach described here could be
   applied to data from Household Consumption and Expenditures Surveys
   (HCES) to characterize households at greatest risk.

AB We describe a new species of Cornufer, subgenus Batrachylodes, from
   high-elevation forests of New Britain Island in the Bismarck Archipelago
   of Eastern Melanesia. The new species, Cornufer exedrus sp. nov., is a
   biogeographically disjunct member of the Batrachylodes clade,
   representing the first record of the subgenus from outside of the
   Solomon Archipelago. The new species is a small terrestrial form from
   dense, closed-canopy forests above 1500 meters elevation in the Nakanai
   Mountains of eastern New Britain. It differs from its closest relatives,
   the other members of the subgenus Batrachylodes, on the basis of its
   minute body size, degree of digital disc expansion, reduced subdigital
   tuberculation, color pattern, and other traits related to its small
   size. We also provide a description of the new species' simple
   advertisement call. The diversity of ceratobatrachid frogs of the
   Bismarck Archipelago is most likely still underestimated despite several
   recent surveys. Our understanding of evolutionary trends and species
   boundaries in the subgenus Batrachylodes currently is hampered by lack
   of genetic samples and call recordings corresponding to voucher
   specimens of the endemic species of Bougainville Island.

AB Scientific findings confirm that Small Island Developing States (SIDS)
   in the Caribbean are experiencing droughts and sea level rises that are
   contributing to saline intrusion of underground aquifers and surface
   water sources. This paper, using Trinidad as a case study, analyses
   water governance challenges in meeting Sustainable Development Goal
   (SDG) 6, which addresses the sustainability of water resources.
   Interviews were conducted with professionals from multi-disciplinary
   backgrounds. Also, data provided by the water agency were analysed to
   evaluate water governance practices. The main contribution of this paper
   is the generation of a blend of policies, good practices and tools to
   confront growing threats to water security and to attain sustainable
   development in Caribbean SIDS in an era of climate change and increasing
   non-climatic stressors. The paper concludes that economic, environmental
   and human resources, reformed administrative and legislative systems,
   and technological tools are fundamental to achieving good water
   governance. Moreover, an array of complementary policies and
   technologies is needed to resolve water governance issues. However,
   political will to implement sustainable water resources management is
   the greatest challenge in attaining SDG 6.

AB Leptospirosis is the most widespread zoonosis in the world. Humans
   become infected through contact with the urine of carrier animals,
   directly or via contaminated environments. This review reports available
   data on animal leptospirosis in ten tropical islands: Barbados,
   Martinique, Guadeloupe, Grenada, Trinidad, New Caledonia, Hawaii, French
   Polynesia, La Reunion and Mayotte. Leptospirosis is endemic in these
   insular wild and domestic fauna. Each island presents a specific panel
   of circulating serovars, closely linked with animal and environmental
   biodiversity, making it epidemiologically different from the mainland.
   Rats, mongooses and mice are proven major renal carriers of leptospires
   in these areas but dogs also constitute a significant potential
   reservoir. In some islands seroprevalence of leptospirosis in animals
   evolves with time, inducing changes in the epidemiology of the human
   disease. Consequently more investigations on animal leptospirosis in
   these ecosystems and use of molecular tools are essential for prevention
   and control of the human disease.

   K. marginata (Cuvier) from fresh water in the western Pacific, east to
   Kosrae, Caroline Islands, and Fiji; K. mugil (Forster) (K. taeniura is a

   the tropical eastern Pacific; K. munda (De Vis) from fresh and brackish
   water in Fiji, Vanuatu, New Caledonia, and Queensland (K. proxima
   Kendall & Goldsborough and K. bilunulata Herre are synonyms); K.
   nutabunda Kendall & Radcliffe from Easter Island; K. petiti Schultz from
   the Phoenix Islands, Malden Island, and the Marquesas Islands (Dules
   taeniurus marquesensis Fowler is a synonym); K. sandvicensis
   (Steindachner) from the Hawaiian Islands and other islands of the
   central Pacific; K. rupestris (Lacepede) from fresh water from East
   Africa to Samoa (K. caerulescens Regan from the Solomon Islands is a new
   synonym); K. salelea Schultz from fresh water in the Samoa Islands; and
   K. xenura (Jordan & Gilbert) from the Hawaiian Islands, with a mistaken
   type locality of El Salvador, Central America. The name K. sandvicensis
   has long been used for the common endemic species in the Hawaiian
   Islands; however, the original description leaves little doubt that it
   should apply to the species widely distributed in the central Pacific
   and only recently discovered in Hawai'i; it has usually been
   misidentified as K. marginata. The endemic Hawaiian species therefore
   takes the only available name, K. xenura (Jordan & Gilbert). Kuhlia
   sandvicensis differs from K. xenura in having a smaller eye (3.0-3.45 in
   head length, compared with 2.55-2.95 for K. xenura), straight dorsal
   profile of the head of adults (concave in xenura); usually 14
   pectoral-fin rays (usually 15 in xenura), usually 50 lateral-line scales
   (usually 49 in xenura), gill rakers 38-43 (35-39 for xenura), and a dark
   reticular pattern dorsally on the head in life.

   Management (CBNRM) from 21 case studies in different countries. The
   study uses Ostrom's design principles and eight objective measures.
   These are empowerment, public participation, equity, conflict resolution
   mechanisms, similarities between misuse and establishment of rules for
   indigenous environments, effective monitoring, collective choice
   arrangements and sanctioning activities for the use of common resources
   to evaluate and compare the case studies to examine the cases. Based on
   the analyses, successes and failures of CBNRM were determined. Successes
   were evident in the management of water resources in Honduras, India,
   Kenya, Nepal and St Lucia. CBNRM was also successful in Fiji, in joint
   forest management in India and other instances such as in Alaska, China,
   Cambodia, Namibia, Malaysia, Mexico, Washington, and to a small extent
   in Papua New Guinea. However, CBNRM initiatives failed in managing
   wildlife conservation in Nepal and Kenya, and in Tanzania wildlife
   management, Uganda and Zimbabwe. CBNRM failure was attributed to the
   uneven distribution of the benefits of natural resources, lack of
   empowerment, low community participation, failure to resolve conflicts,
   among many factors. In this study, the recommendations is made that
   similar research should be conducted with a larger sample size and
   employ other techniques such as Principal Component Analysis for
   examining the characteristics that achieve effective and sustainable
   CBNRM initiatives.

   that in assessing the lasting impact of community development projects
   (in this instance, WASH) the term benefit persistence better captures
   the wider scope of impact that a project might have on a community
   extending beyond the stated project goals and objectives. These
   'additional' or unstated impacts can extend the benefit that aid
   projects can have. A number of areas that strengthen the likelihood of
   benefit persistence were also identified.

AB We compared the haemosporidian parasite faunas (Plasmodium and
   Haemoproteus) of small land birds on the islands of St Lucia, St Vincent
   and Grenada in the southern Lesser Antilles. The islands differ in
   distance from the South American source of colonists, proximity to each
   other, and similarity of their avifaunas. On each island, we obtained
   419572 blood samples from 2225 of the 3441 resident species. We detected
   parasite infection by PCR and identified parasite lineages by sequencing
   a portion of the mitochondrial cytochrome b gene. Parasite prevalence
   varied from 31% on St Lucia to 22% on St Vincent and 18% on Grenada.
   Abundant parasite lineages differed between the three islands in spite
   of the similarity in host species. As in other studies, the geographic
   distributions of the individual parasite lineages varied widely between
   local endemism and broad distribution within the West Indies, including
   cases of long-distance disjunction. St Vincent was unusual in the near
   absence of Plasmodium parasites, which accorded with low numbers of
   suitable mosquito vectors reported from the island. Parasites on St
   Vincent also tended to be host specialists compared to those on St Lucia
   and Grenada. Similarity in parasite assemblages among the three islands
   varied in parallel with host assemblage similarity (but not similarity
   of infected hosts) and with geographic proximity. Parasite prevalence
   increased with host abundance on both St Lucia and St Vincent, but not
   on Grenada; prevalence did not vary between endemic and more widespread
   host species. In addition, the endemic host species harbored parasites
   that were recovered from a variety of non-endemic species as well. These
   results support the individualistic nature of haemosporidian parasite
   assemblages in evolutionarily independent host populations.

AB Many social-ecologically sensitive Small Island Developing States (SIDS)
   increasingly face global (climate) change risks to sustainable
   development. However, the validity of factors said to contribute toward
   vulnerability is disputed in light of the differing economic success,
   enormous heterogeneity, divergent paths of development, and varying
   potential for adaptability displayed by small islands. Research on
   uncertainty, vulnerability and resilience of coupled social-ecological
   systems (SES) can provide a valuable contribution to the sustainability
   debate. Based on the fundamentals of complexity theory, the notions of
   social-ecological adaptability, and panarchy, this article highlights
   the role of context-based, hybrid, and limited environmental knowledge
   and risk knowledge systems and cultures. The modes of organization of
   disaster management in Grenada (Eastern Caribbean) and environmental
   governance in The Bahamas (Western Caribbean) on various spatio-temporal
   scales serve as case studies. The production and communication of
   knowledge, the difficult (cross-scale) integration of diverse knowledge
   systems, the role of experience and memory, as well as
   social/institutional learning and inertia appear as significant factors
   as regards the strengthening of social adaptability. The findings
   further demonstrate that significant challenges remain for Caribbean
   SIDS. These include long-term, socially, locally, and sectorally
   differentiated vulnerabilities; deficits in governance and
   communication; and the diverging and spatially-temporally bounded nature
   of knowledge systems. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Antigua and Barbuda is rapidly developing a tourism industry built
   around a marketed perception of a healthy marine and coastal
   environment. Yet economic indicators suggest that Antigua and Barbuda is
   overexploiting its marine resources, particularly its fish and coral
   reef communities. Although its marine resources remain relatively
   healthy, Antigua and Barbuda will jeopardise the ecological basis of its
   economic growth and sustainability if current exploitation rates
   continue. We compare the current situation and economic trends of
   Antigua and Barbuda's tourism and commercial fishery industries to those
   of Jamaica and other OECS member states. Jamaica is suggested as a
   cautionary example of the potential socioeconomic and ecological impacts
   caused by resource overexploitation and mismanagement within the various
   economic sectors. Antigua and Barbuda is at a crossroads. The 'Jamaica
   path' leads to large-scale resource depletion, fishery collapse, and a
   mass tourism industry that can operate independent of a healthy
   environment. Alternatively, it can pursue a path that seeks to conserve
   its marine resources. Antigua and Barbuda will be better able to protect
   its sustainability both for commercial fishing interests and its growing
   high-end destination tourism industry. To this end, Antigua and Barbuda
   has developed a network of marine-protected areas along the northeastern
   coast of Antigua, an area popular with both fishers and tourists.

AB Groundwater resources of small coral islands are threatened due to
   short-term and long-term changes in climate. A significant short-term
   threat is El Nino events, which typically induce a severe months-long
   drought for many atoll nations in the western and central Pacific
   regions that exhausts rainwater supply and necessitates the use of
   groundwater. This study quantifies fresh groundwater resources under
   both average rainfall and drought conditions for the Republic of
   Marshall Islands (RMI), a nation composed solely of atolls and which is
   severely impacted by El Nino droughts. The atoll island algebraic model
   is used to estimate the thickness of the freshwater lens for 680
   inhabited and uninhabited islands of the RMI, with a focus on the severe
   1998 drought. The model accounts for precipitation, island width,
   hydraulic conductivity of the upper Holocene-age sand aquifer, the depth
   to the contact between the Holocene aquifer and the lower
   Pleistocene-age limestone aquifer, and the presence of a reef flat plate
   underlying the ocean side of the island. Model results are tested for
   islands that have fresh groundwater data. Results highlight the
   fragility of groundwater resources for the nation. Average lens
   thickness during typical seasonal rainfall is approximately 4 m, with
   only 30% of the islands maintaining a lens thicker than 4.5% and 55% of
   the islands with a lens less than 2.5 m thick. Thicker lenses typically
   occur for larger islands, islands located on the leeward side of an
   atoll due to lower hydraulic conductivity, and islands located in the
   southern region of the RMI due to higher rainfall rates. During drought,
   groundwater on small islands (<300 m in width) is completely depleted.
   Over half (54%) of the islands are classified as "Highly Vulnerable" to
   drought. Results provide valuable information for RMI water resources
   planners, particularly during the current 2016 El Nino drought, and
   similar methods can be used to quantify groundwater availability for
   other atoll island nations, including the Federated State of Micronesia,
   Republic of Maldives, and Republic of Kiribati.

   foods, especially rice. Food security requires more adequate market
   access, but national resource bases are limited, and government
   intervention and policy formation are both weak and exhibit urban bias
   in unusually fragmented states. Climate change is likely to further
   hamper local food production. Household has negotiated multiple
   livelihoods across international boundaries with national and household
   incomes boosted by remittances, which may become a distinctive key to
   achieving improved health and nutritional status.

AB Microbial fuel cell (MFC) technology represents a form of renewable
   energy that generates bioelectricity from what would otherwise be
   considered a waste stream. MFCs may be ideally suited to the small
   island developing state (SIDS) context, such as Trinidad and Tobago
   where seawater as the main electrolyte is readily available, and
   economically renewable and sustainable electricity is also deemed a
   priority. Hence this project tested two identical laboratory-scaled MFC
   systems that were specifically designed and developed for the Caribbean
   regional context. They consisted of two separate chambers: an anaerobic
   anodic chamber inoculated with wastewater and an aerobic cathodic
   chamber separated by a proton exchange membrane. Domestic wastewater
   from two various wastewater treatment plants inflow (after screening)
   was placed into the anodic chamber, and seawater from the Atlantic Ocean
   and Gulf of Paria placed into the cathodic chambers, respectively, with
   the bacteria present in the wastewater attached to the anode.
   Experimental results demonstrated that the bacterial degradation of the
   wastewaters as substrate induced an electron flow through the electrodes
   producing bioelectricity whilst simultaneously reducing the organic
   matter as biochemical oxygen demand and chemical oxygen demand by 30 to
   75 %. The average bioenergy output for both systems was 84 and 96
   mW/m(2), respectively. This study demonstrated the potential for
   simultaneous bioenergy production and wastewater treatment in the SIDS
   context.

AB The mean absolute geostrophic circulation of the Coral Sea is
   constructed from climatological hydrographic data referenced to a 1000 m
   velocity field derived from Argo float drift. Two branches of the South
   Equatorial Current (SEC) enter the Coral Sea between New Caledonia and
   the Solomon Islands: the broad, upper thermocline North Vanuatu Jet
   (NVJ), and the narrow North Caledonian Jet (NCJ) extending to at least
   1500 m. Most of this incoming flow leaves to the Solomon Sea. Four
   distinct pathways through the Coral Sea are traced by their water
   properties: (1) The NCJ crosses the Sea to the coast of Australia and
   turns north at densities sigma 25-27.4 as the main source of the Gulf of
   Papua (GPC) western boundary current, eventually feeding the New Guinea
   Coastal Undercurrent; (2) part of the shallow NVJ turns into the Solomon
   Sea in midbasin, carrying high-salinity water above sigma 25.5; (3)
   another part of the NVJ continues to Australia, then turns north to join
   the GPC, extending it to the surface; (4) a shallow finger of NVJ water,
   traced by low oxygen above sigma 25, turns south along the coast,
   beginning the East Australian Current (EAC) at 15 degrees S. Total
   transport from the Coral to the Tasman Sea is small and shallow;
   instead, most of the EAC is fed from south of New Caledonia, consistent
   with the Island Rule. However, large transport fractions occur in narrow
   jets close to coastlines and reefs and are not well sampled, precluding
   a quantitative estimate of meridional redistribution of the incoming
   SEC.

AB Short-finned pilot whales (Globicephala macrorhynchus) are known for
   their highly social cohesive behavior which contributes to the reporting
   by the public of mass stranding. This species has been hunted in the
   Lesser Antilles in the Caribbean for generations. Currently, the genetic
   diversity of short-finned pilot whales has been investigated in the
   North Atlantic, South Pacific and Japan/Korea, but not in the Caribbean.
   Here we provide the first description of the genetic diversity of this
   species in the Caribbean using mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) control region
   (CR) sequences and seven microsatellite loci from 25 skin samples
   collected from four stranding events in Jamaica, Puerto Rico, British
   Virgin Islands, and Trinidad and Tobago. Overall, three CR haplotypes
   were identified; of these, one was unique for the Caribbean (Car 1),
   while a second (haplotype D) was previously reported in the Western
   North Atlantic, and a third (Haplotype A) was found to be common in the
   South Pacific. Even though sample size (n = 25) was small,
   microsatellite analysis showed a low level of relatedness between the
   stranded whales. Our results provide relevant preliminary information on
   the genetic diversity of short-finned pilot whales in the Caribbean,
   reporting one previously unknown and unique haplotype for this region.
   Further research should be carried out in the Caribbean to further our
   knowledge on this species, particularly since its prone to mass
   stranding. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Unique experience has accumulated in the English-speaking Caribbean in
   the field of family life education for youth. Although birth rates are
   relatively low, the increase in adolescent pregnancy and births is
   becoming more visible. Mother-centered homes are frequent, and support
   from the father is often lacking. A series of family life education
   (FLE) programs funded by the United National Fund for Population
   Activities is aimed at providing help to the various groups in the
   Caribbean in an acceptable and non-threatening manner. These
   out-of-school FLE techniques include several approaches: integration of
   the proposed program into an already established place (a factory, youth
   center, or community center); education in human growth, food and
   nutrition, environmental health, mental health, safety and first-aid,
   dental health and human relations, including human sexuality, rights and
   responsibilities, and decision making; and the use of specially trained
   personnel who understand the conditions of the particular community. In
   some countries adolescent pregnancy is viewed as a problem. In others it
   may not be so considered. It is vital for the staff and community
   leaders to review proposals for the FLE program and bring into the
   centers all subjects that are free of controversy. Family planning,
   contraceptive delivery and even human sexuality may be acceptable
   subjects in some quarters, and not in others. Efforts must be continued
   to find innovative approaches to assure that the benefits of these
   learning activities continue to be provided, and expanded in response to
   growing acceptance.
AB This article is based on evaluations made of programs in Antiqua,
   Barbados, Dominica, Jamaica, St. Christopher and Nevis, and St. Lucia. 
   Although birth rates are relatively low in the English-speaking
   Caribbean (ranging between 16 and 30 per 1000 in 1984), the incidence of
   adolescent pregnancies and births is increasing.  Mother-centered homes
   are frequent, and support from the father is often lacking.  Adolescent
   births represent 25-35% of all births in the English-speaking Caribbean.
   This proportion has changed little over time.  About 2-3% of all births
   to teenagers occur in the under-15 year old group.  A significant
   proportion of teenage births occur to girls under age 18, before they
   finish school.  The 1978 "Caribbean Workshop on Family Life Education
   and Health Education" defined family life education (FLE) as "the total
   physical, mental, social, and emotional well being of the individual so
   as to help him maximize his potential and to enable him to carry on the
   activities he needs to undertake for the good of himself and others." 
   Out-of-school FLE includes community centers, factories, and youth
   centers.  The youth center approach is most appropriate for this region
   because it provides a nucleus for skills training, recreation, and
   continuous education.  Countries tend to focus almost exclusively on the
   youth center approach.  Activities of these centers include 1) FLE; 2)
   contraceptive services, to some extent; 3) community involvement; and 4)
   programs with a male focus.  Some places oppose family planning or
   contraceptive services to adolescents.  Youth centers offer a broad
   range of activities.  For these centers to be effective, their
   communities must elicit support from the business community, private
   social organizations, and volunteers.  Each community must assess its
   own situation and consider the resources available.  The projects have
   shown that it is possible to initiate and make considerable progress in
   the implementation of FLE programs for adolescents even when adolescent
   pregnancy and births are still highly sensitive and controversial
   issues, and when there are no official policies in favor of such
   programs.

AB Fiscal-food policies use taxes to alter relative food prices so as to
   change diets and are suggested for reducing non-communicable diseases in
   the Pacific. Price elasticity estimates used by advocates of fiscal-food
   policies are often biased and may make policy makers too optimistic
   about small taxes on unhealthy food and drink inducing big changes in
   diets. The bias is illustrated using the example of the demand for soft
   drinks in a household survey from the Solomon Islands, with further
   evidence from Papua New Guinea. About one-third of consumer response to
   soft drink price variation in the Solomon Islands is on the quantity
   margin, with two-thirds on the quality margin. If the quality response
   is wrongly treated as a quantity response to price-as in most
   studies-the price elasticity of soft drink demand is exaggerated by a
   factor of two in Papua New Guinea and three in the Solomon Islands.

   from the islands of Buka and Choiseul in the Solomon Archipelago,
   closely related to, and previously included within, T. pseudoponceleti.
   One species, T. parkeri sp. nov., is endemic to Buka Island and was
   revealed in our previous study via taxonomically focused analyses of
   both next-generation sequencing data and morphology. Here, we also
   further support the validity of this species by more taxonomically
   comprehensive Bayesian species delimitation of three Sanger sequenced
   nuclear loci. The second species, T. choiseulensis sp. nov., is endemic
   to Choiseul Island and was revealed by an expanded morphological data
   analysis. These results suggest that numerous other species found on
   multiple island groups in the Solomon Archipelago may similarly
   represent complexes of multiple, closely related species, and that the
   biodiversity of the region is vastly underestimated.

AB Myrmecophilus ant crickets are tiny wingless ant symbionts that live in
   and around ant nests. Myrmecophilus crickets are kleptoparasitic on
   their host ants, feeding on food resources in the ant nests and inducing
   ants to regurgitate liquid food. Most Myrmecophilus crickets are not
   species-specific with respect to host ant. Here, we review all published
   records of M. americanus and report new records of M. americanus from
   the West Indies.
   Published site records of M. americanus come from around the world,
   including India, the western Indian Ocean (Madagascar, Seychelles,
   Reunion), northeastern Africa (Egypt, Libya, Sudan), the Middle East
   (Israel), Oceania (Hawaii), and the Neotropics (Brazil, Colombia, Cuba,
   Haiti). In all recorded cases except one, the ant host of M americanus
   was the longhorn crazy ant, Paratrechina longicornis.
   We collected a total of 52 M. americanus specimens (23 males, 15
   females, 14 juveniles) from P longicornis nests at 13 sites on six West
   Indian islands: Antigua, Aruba, Montserrat, Nevis, St. Kitts, and St.
   Martin. We found that the number of dorsal spurs on the hind basitarsus
   varied among and within adult M. americanus specimens, calling into
   question the use of this character in distinguishing different species.
   Adult M. americanus resemble the gaster of P longicornis queens in size
   and shape. This resemblance may be mimicry, evolved to fool P
   longicornis workers that encounter the crickets. If the association of
   M. americanus with P longicornis is more species-specific than the host
   associations of other ant crickets, we would expect future studies to
   find additional species-specific adaptations that may be unique to the M
   americanus - P longicornis association.

AB Community health programmes can be one of the most important and most

   outlines health programmes and health education initiatives, as well as
   approaches to participatory training, in several South Pacific
   countries.
AB In pre-colonial times, health in some Pacific countries was good
   compared with that of Europe.  Illnesses such as scrofula, rheumatism,
   and filariasis often received herbal treatment.  More recently, however,
   traditional diet throughout the region have been replaced by canned
   fish, biscuit, white flour products, and sugar-laden food.  New
   illnesses and diseases have emerged in Pacific countries since European
   intrusion.  Though malaria is still the primary cause of death in
   Vanuatu, diabetes, hypertension, obesity, and coronary heart disease are
   prime health concerns in most Pacific countries.  In Kiribati, health
   educators use materials in discussion groups and schoolteachers use
   special materials on AIDS in their teaching, Calendars are produced in
   cooperation with national nutrition and family planning (FP) groups and
   agencies that highlight health topics such as AIDS and vitamin-A
   deficiency.  Material produced by the Vanuatu health education unit
   features nutrition, the environment, FP, and AIDS and other sexually
   transmitted diseases.  The government's Women's Affairs Department the
   International Labor Organization and other agencies are involved in FP
   and family life education.  In Fiji and the Solomon Islands, nutrition
   has been highlighted in health education campaigns.  In both countries
   surveys indicated alarming levels of diet-related disease.  Another
   important nutrition project in the Solomon Islands is the village
   education program.  At a training center, trainers conduct 15 practical
   courses for mobile workers, community workers, and village resource
   persons.  Under this program, 60 village-level workshops are held each
   year focusing on nutrition, cooking, and gardening.  Nutrition is now a
   major focus of health in the Pacific.  The health, nutrition, education,
   fisheries, and agricultural sectors work with other agencies for success
   through community participation and through an integrated approach.

   deposition in 150+m water depth. This association has now been extended
   back into the Late Oligocene. Crinoids and brachiopods both occur in the
   Antigua Formation of Antigua; both occur high in the formation, implying
   deeper water in this retrograde succession. They have received little
   attention from systematists, although the brachiopods Cistellarcula
   dubia Cooper and Tichosina foresti Cooper have previously been described
   from the Antigua Formation; to these, we add Cistellarcula sp.,
   Argyrotheca sp. and Tichosina sp. At Half Moon Bay in southeast Antigua,
   high in the Antigua Formation, we have found columnals of isocrinid
   crinoids (cf. Isocrinus sp.) associated with rare brachiopods
   (Terebratulina sp.) in island slope deposits. These taxa provide
   independent evidence for the deeper water aspect of this part of the
   Antigua Formation, in beds that also yield large, thin-walled fossil
   sponges.

AB Bele (Abelmoshus manihot), is one of the Pacific's most nutritious
   indigenous vegetables, yet it is often neglected, unexplored and
   unexploited. It is known by several names in the Pacific: aibika,
   slippery cabbage or pele. It is high in protein, vitamins (Vitamins A
   and C, riboflavin, thiamin and niacin) and minerals (potassium,
   magnesium, calcium and iron). As such, it has an important role in
   counteracting micronutrient deficiencies and improving the diets of
   Pacific populations who suffer from some of the highest rates of diet
   related non-communicable diseases in the world. This paper explores the
   outputs of a French Pacific-funded project coordinated by the
   Secretariat of the Pacific Community Centre for Pacific Crops and Trees
   (SPC CePaCT) with Papua New Guinea (PNG), New Caledonia, Vanuatu,
   Solomon Islands and Fiji. The project involves the comprehensive
   cataloguing of bele diversity in countries and the establishment of the
   first regional collection of bele at the CePaCT in Fiji. It also
   establishes protocols for virus indexing and in vitro culture. The
   importance of bele in terms of genetic diversity, climate change
   resilience and nutrition will be promoted using posters. Furthermore,
   the project discusses preliminary profit analysis conducted on optimal
   production of bele versus normal traditional farming practices in New
   Caledonia and PNG. It also looks at viability of bele using Fiji as a
   case study in order to explore the potential opportunities and
   challenges to greater commercialisation and even export. The project
   also involves strengthening linkages and networks amongst Pacific island
   countries and other global centres such as the World Vegetable Centre in
   Taiwan notably endowed with the technical expertise on the development
   and utilisation of indigenous vegetables.

AB We analyzed the distribution patterns of the galatheid squat lobsters
   (Crustacea, Decapoda, Galatheidae) of the Pacific Ocean. We used the
   presence/absence data of 402 species along the continental slope and
   continental rise (200-2000 m) obtained from 54 cruises carried out in
   areas around the Philippines, Indonesia, Solomon, Vanuatu, New
   Caledonia, Fiji, Tonga, Wallis and Futuna and French Polynesia. The
   total number of stations was ca. 3200. We also used published data from
   other expeditions carried out in the Pacific waters, and from an
   exhaustive search of ca. 600 papers on the taxonomy and biogeography of
   Pacific species. We studied the existence of biogeographic provinces
   using multivariate analyses, and present data on latitudinal and
   longitudinal patterns of species richness, rate of endemism and the
   relationship between body sizes with the size of the geographic ranges.
   Latitudinal species richness along the Western and Eastern Pacific
   exhibited an increase from higher latitudes towards the Equator.
   Longitudinal species richness decreased considerably from the Western to
   the Central Pacific. Size frequency distribution for body size was
   strongly shifted toward small sizes and endemic species were
   significantly smaller than non-endemics. This study concludes that a
   clear separation exists between the moderately poor galatheid fauna of
   the Eastern Pacific and the rich Western and Central Pacific faunas. Our
   results also show that the highest numbers of squat lobsters are found
   in the Coral Sea (Solomon-Vanuatu-New Caledonia islands) and
   Indo-Malay-Philippines archipelago (IMPA). The distribution of endemism
   along the Pacific Ocean indicates that there are several major centres
   of diversity, e.g. Coral Sea, IMPA, New Zealand and French Polynesia.
   The high proportion of endemism in these areas suggests that they have
   evolved independently. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Diabetes has become a global epidemic. The increased incidence of NIDDM
   is seen all over the world but there is geographical variation. Certain
   population groups show increased susceptibility to develop diabetes. The
   prevalence is lowest in Caucasian whites and highest in Pima Indians and
   Naurans. Iceland has a particularly low incidence whereas Bahrain is
   among the countries with highest prevalence. The highest prevalence of
   diabetes in 2000 was found in Papua New Guiana (15.5%), Mauritius (15%),
   Bahrain (14.8%), Mexico (14.2%), Trinidad and Tobago (14.1%). Most of
   the hypotheses developed to explain this trend concerned mainly on
   dietary and nutritional factors. Man had to struggle against harsh
   climatic conditions for survival. It has been observed that people who
   have been adapted to cold environment for generations demonstrate some
   resistance to develop diabetes. It is hypothesized that presence of
   thick subcutaneous fat, reactivation of brown adipose tissue in cold
   environment and effective mitochondrial enzyme systems for heat
   generation act as adaptive mechanisms for survival in cold environment
   and retard the development of visceral obesity. Mitochondrial defects
   have been found in patients with NIDDM and NAFLD. Changes of nuclear
   genes which encode mitochondrial enzyme systems involved in thermo
   genesis could be the cause for development of visceral obesity and
   NIDDM. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Objective: To examine the relationship between food insecurity and child
   wellbeing indicators.
   Design: Cross-sectional survey conducted in 2344 households with
   children. The main exposure measure was food insecurity status, which
   was categorized as food secure or food insecure based on two or more
   food insecurity questions answered in the affirmative. Multiple logistic
   regression analysis was used to model the association between food
   insecurity Status and selected child wellbeing indicators.
   Setting: Barbados, St. Lucia and St. Vincent and the Grenadines
   (hereafter St. Vincent), three Eastern Caribbean countries, 2005.
   Subjects: A random sample of households with children was identified by
   the governments of Barbados, St. Lucia and St. Vincent. In-home
   interviews were conducted by social workers.
   Results: One-third (33%) Of households were categorized as food
   insecure. Food-insecure households were more likely to include a
   chronically ill parent (OR = 2.48; 95% Cl 1.76, 3.49), a recently
   divorced parent (Oil = 1.92; 95% Cl 1.21, 3.05), a child requiring
   multiple visits to a health-care provider for a disability (OR = 3.98;
   95% Cl 1.20, 13.19) or injury (OR = 1.78; 95% CI 1.12, 2.83), a child
   with a learning disability (01 = 2.08; 95% Cl 1.16, 3.74) or a child
   with a physical disability (OR = 2.54; 95% Cl 1.22, 5.32) after
   adjustment for poverty and other demographic variables.
   Conclusions: The results indicate that food-insecure households were
   more likely to be burdened by child disability (learning and physical),
   family system disruption (recent divorce and chronic illness) and child
   health-care needs (for disability and injury) than food-secure
   households. The implementation of programmes and policies to minimize

AB Nuts have huge potential to improve the livelihood of the rural poor in
   developing countries and meet the Millennium Development Goal to
   eradicate extreme poverty and hunger. Nuts often have a high protein and
   oil content, giving them excellent nutritional value. They can be
   processed and stored for long periods and therefore can improve food
   security, be sold for cash or be processed and exported to distant
   markets, thus helping the rural poor to participate in the cash economy.
   We report here on three processing systems for Canarium indicum nuts
   developed in three Pacific Island countries: Papua New Guinea, Solomon
   Islands and Vanuatu. Centralized processing has been developed in Papua
   New Guinea and fruit is purchased from smallholders at a central
   processing facility. The fruit is depulped, the nut-in-shell is cracked,
   the testa is removed and the kernel is dried using ovens in this
   facility. This provides a very high quality product and reduces the risk
   of microbial contamination. In decentralized processing systems, the
   farmers in remote locations crack and dry the nuts using traditional
   methods (Solomon Islands) or solar driers (Vanuatu) then sell the dried
   kernel to a centralized processor. This reduces transport costs and
   requires no infrastructure, but there is a greater risk of poor quality
   kernels or microbial contamination. In village cracking systems in
   Vanuatu, the fruits are processed and cracked in the village and
   supplied as fresh, high moisture content kernel-in-testa to secondary
   processors. This is a hybrid system that minimizes transport costs and
   risks of contamination. However, this system requires delivery to the
   processor immediately after cracking to stabilize the kernel. The most
   appropriate system for processing will depend on the unique
   circumstances of each country.

   metabolites (DDTs), HCH isomers (HCHs), chlordane compounds (CHLs),
   aldrin, dieldrin, heptachlor, heptachlor epoxide and HCB were determined
   in a wide variety of foodstuffs collected from different locations in
   Australia, Papua New Guinea and the Solomon Islands. Elevated levels of
   PCBs, CHLs, DDTs and dieldrin were detected in most of the foodstuffs of
   animal origin. Fish samples collected near the coast of Sydney recorded
   noticeable concentrations of PCBs, CHLs and DDTs. PCB contamination was
   generally prominent in samples collected in urban areas, whereas
   organochlorine pesticides were distributed uniformly throughout
   Australia. The widespread usage of CHLs was evident from the composition
   of its compounds in various foods while HCHs and DDTs were found to have
   been used sporadically in space and time. For the most part, residue
   levels of organochlorines in foodstuffs were below the tolerance limits
   established by national and international health organizations. The
   exception was CHLs in some fish samples, which exceeded the maximum
   residue limits recommended by the National Health and Medical Research
   Council of the Australian government. Although the number of samples
   analysed in each class of foods is small for the purpose of estimating
   human dietary exposure, we tentatively conclude that the dietary intake
   of PCBs in Australia was higher than those observed in most developed
   and developing nations, whereas the intake of organochlorine pesticides
   was higher than in developed nations but lower than in developing
   countries. Meat products contributed to the higher dietary intakes of
   most of the organochlorines. The contamination pattern and the residual
   concentrations of organochlorines in foodstuffs of Papua New Guinea and
   the Solomon Islands resembled those observed in Australia.

AB Groundwater resources of the Republic of the Maldives are threatened by
   a variety of factors including variable future rainfall patterns,
   continued population growth and associated pumping demands, rising sea
   level, and contamination from the land surface. This study assesses
   changes in groundwater availability due to variable rainfall patterns
   and sea level rise (SLR) in the coming decades, a key component of water
   resources management for the country. Using a suite of two-dimensional
   density-dependent groundwater flow models, time-dependent thickness of
   the freshwater lens is simulated for a range of island sizes (200 to
   1,100m) during the time period of 2011 to 2050, with recharge to the
   freshwater lens calculated using rainfall patterns provided by general
   circulation models for the three distinct geographic regions of the
   Maldives. The effect of SLR on the freshwater lens is quantified using
   estimates of shoreline recession and associated decreases in island
   width. If rainfall is solely considered, groundwater availability is
   projected to increase, as lens thickness during the 2031-2050 time
   periods is slightly greater (1-5%) than during the 2011-2030 time
   period. However, including the impact of SLR indicates an overall
   decrease in lens thickness, with drastic decreases (60% to 100%)
   projected for small islands (200m) and moderate decreases (12% to 14%)
   expected for 400m islands, which accommodate one third of the national
   population. Similar methodologies can be used for other atoll island
   nations, such as the Republic of Marshall Islands, Federated States of
   Micronesia, and the Republic of Kiribati. For the Maldives, results from
   this study can be used in conjunction with population growth estimates
   to determine the feasibility of including groundwater in water resources
   planning and management for the country.

AB This paper presents a supply-and-demand model for the fisheries sector
   developed to assess the effect of climate change and related adaptation
   strategies in four Pacific coral triangle (CT) countries Fiji, Solomon
   Islands, Timor-Leste, and Vanuatu. The modeling approach used in this
   paper represents climate change in terms of supply shocks, and works out
   its economic consequences using the microeconomic tools of supply and
   demand. The analysis has considered three time periods: current
   (represented by the average data of the three most recent available
   years 2006-2009), medium term (2035), and long term (2050). The study
   covers all fisheries and aquaculture species, grouped into six key
   subsectors: tuna, other oceanic finfish, coastal finfish, coastal
   invertebrates, freshwater finfish, and freshwater invertebrates. Results
   of the baseline model indicate that with rising per capita income and
   population, fish demand is expected to increase substantially up to
   2050. In contrast to significant growth in fish demand, growth in
   domestic fish production is projected to be slow due to climate change
   and other constraints. There is a strong likelihood that many Pacific
   countries will become large net importers of fish under the baseline
   scenario (i.e., without implementing climate change adaptation
   strategies). Likewise, per capita consumption of domestically produced

   system, hosted by WorldFish, which stores bio-physical, ecological and
   socio-economic data for the 'Coral Triangle Area' in South-east Asia and
   the Pacific. The database has been built in partnership with all six
   (Timor-Leste, Malaysia, Indonesia, The Philippines, Solomon Islands and
   Papua New Guinea) of the Coral Triangle countries, and represents a
   valuable source of information for natural resource managers at the
   regional scale. Its utility is demonstrated using biophysical data, data
   summarising marine habitats, and data describing the extent of marine
   protected areas in the region.

AB This study was conducted to investigate the demography, management, and
   production practices on layer chicken farms in Trinidad and Tobago,
   Grenada, and St. Lucia and the frequency of risk factors for Salmonella
   infection. The frequency of isolation of Salmonella from the layer farm
   environment, eggs, feeds, hatchery, and imported day-old chicks was
   determined using standard methods. Of the eight risk factors (farm size,
   age group of layers, source of day-old chicks, vaccination, sanitation
   practices, biosecurity measures, presence of pests, and previous disease
   outbreaks) for Salmonella infection investigated, farm size was the only
   risk factor significantly associated (P = 0.031) with the prevalence of
   Salmonella; 77.8% of large farms were positive for this pathogen
   compared with 33.3 and 26.1% of medium and small farms, respectively.
   The overall isolation rate of Salmonella from 35 layer farms was 40.0%.
   Salmonella was isolated at a significantly higher rate (P < 0.05) from
   farm environments than from the cloacae. Only in Trinidad and Tobago did
   feeds (6.5% of samples) and pooled egg contents (12.5% of samples) yield
   Salmonella; however, all egg samples from hotels, hatcheries, and
   airports in this country were negative. Salmonella Anatum, Salmonella
   group C, and Salmonella Kentucky were the predominant serotypes in
   Trinidad and Tobago, Grenada, and St. Lucia, respectively. Although
   Salmonella infections were found in layer birds sampled, table eggs
   appear to pose minimal risk to consumers. However, the detection of
   Salmonella-contaminated farm environments and feeds cannot be ignored.
   Only 2.9% of the isolates belonged to Salmonella Enteritidis, a finding
   that may reflect the impact of changes in farm management and poultry
   production in the region.

AB The new family Belomitridae is established for the deep-water buccinoid
   genus Belomitra P. Fischer, 1883, based on morphological (shell and
   radulae) and molecular evidence. The rachiglossate radula is uniquely
   characterized by a multicuspid rachidian and lateral teeth with very
   long narrow bases and two small cusps closer to tip. Molecular analysis
   of a reduced set of Buccinoidea did not resolve the group as a clade,
   but shows that Belomitridae forms a well supported clade within
   Buccinoidea. Species of Belomitra have adult sizes in the 7-53 mm range;
   they live in deep water, mostly in the 500-2,000 meters range, at low
   and mid latitudes. Eleven valid species described from the Indo-Pacific
   were originally named in the families Buccinidae, Columbellidae,
   Cancellariidae, Volutidae, and Turridae. Fourteen new species are
   described: Belomitra nesiotica n. sp. (Society Islands to Tonga and Fiji
   in 580-830 m), B. bouteti n. sp. (Society and Tuamotu Islands in 430-830

AB Tyrophagus (Acari: Acaridae) are primarily fungivorous mites commonly
   found in stored food products and decaying organic matter. They are also
   associates of various insects, or inhabitants of vertebrate nests. They
   are the most abundant and economically important mites inhabiting stored
   food and products. Some Tyrophagus species are also facultatively
   phytophagous and can cause economic damage to plants, including both
   ornamental flowers and vegetables grown in greenhouses. In this
   contribution, Tyrophagus mites of New Zealand are comprehensively
   revised, along with species found in Australia and other Oceanian
   countries. This will assist identification and facilitate requests for
   rapid quarantine decisions from trading partners. Ten species, including
   two new species, are described and illustrated from New Zealand:
   Tyrophagus communis sp. n., T. curvipenis Fain & Fauvel, T longior
   (Gervais), T macfarlanei sp. n., T neiswanderi Johnston & Bruce, T
   putrescentiae (Schrank), T robertsonae Lynch, T savasi Lynch, T similis
   Volgin, and T vanheurni Oudemans. Seven species, including three new
   species, are described and illustrated from Australia and Oceanian
   countries: T australasiae (Oudemans), T. javensis (Oudemans),
   T.pacificus sp. n., T perniciosus Zalchvatkin, T tropicus Robertson, T
   womersleyi sp. n., and T xenoductus sp. n. Identification keys to adult
   females and males are given, along with taxonomic references,
   hosts/habitats and distribution data of each species. In addition to the
   descriptions of five new species, the following nomenclatural changes
   are made: Tyrophagus africanus Meyer & Rodrigues, 1966 syn. n. of
   Tyrophagus neiswanderi Johnston & Bruce, 1965; T palmarum Oudemans sensu
   Robertson, 1959 syn. n. of T vanheurni Oudemans (revived). The species
   concepts of T putrescentiae (Schrank) and T. javensis (Oudemans) are

AB In 2000, a pathogenic virus was discovered in juvenile Caribbean spiny
   lobsters Panulirus argus from the Florida Keys, USA. Panulirus argus
   virus 1 (PaV1) is the first naturally occurring pathogenic virus
   reported from lobsters, and it profoundly affects their ecology and
   physiology. PaV1 is widespread in the Caribbean with infections reported
   in Florida (USA), St. Croix, St. Kitts, Yucatan (Mexico), Belize, and
   Cuba. It is most prevalent and nearly always lethal in the smallest
   juvenile lobsters, but this declines with increasing lobster size;
   adults harbor the virus, but do not present the characteristic signs of
   the disease. No other PaV1 hosts are known. The prevalence of PaV1 in
   juvenile lobsters from the Florida Keys has been stable since 1999, but
   has risen to nearly 11% in the eastern Yucatan since 2001. Heavily
   infected lobsters become sedentary, cease feeding, and die of metabolic
   exhaustion. Experimental routes of viral transmission include ingestion,
   contact, and for newly settled juveniles, free virus particles in
   seawater. Prior to infectiousness, healthy lobsters tend to avoid
   diseased lobsters and so infected juvenile lobsters mostly dwell alone,
   which appears to reduce disease transmission. However, avoidance of
   diseased individuals may result in increased shelter competition between
   healthy and diseased lobsters, and greater predation on infected
   lobsters. Little is known about PaV1 outside of Mexico and the USA, but
   it poses a potential threat to P. argus fisheries throughout the
   Caribbean.

AB This investigation determined the frequency of resistance of 84 isolates
   of Salmonella comprising 14 serotypes recovered from layer farms in
   three Caribbean countries (Trinidad and Tobago, Grenada, and St. Lucia)
   to eight antimicrobial agents, using the disc diffusion method.
   Resistance among isolates of Salmonella was related to the country of
   recovery, type of sample, size of layer farms, and isolate serotype.
   Overall, all (100.0%) of the isolates exhibited resistance to one or
   more of seven antimicrobial agents tested, and all were susceptible to
   chloramphenicol. The resistance detected ranged from 11.9% to
   sulphamethoxazole-trimethoprim (SXT) to 100.0% to erythromycin. The
   difference was, however, not statistically significant (P = 0.23).
   Across countries, for types of samples that yielded Salmonella,
   significant differences in frequency of resistance were detected only to
   SXT (P = 0.002) in Trinidad and Tobago and to gentamycin (P = 0.027) in
   St. Lucia. For the three countries, the frequency of resistance to
   antimicrobial agents was significantly different for ampicillin (P =
   0.001) and SXT (P = 0.032). A total of 83 (98.8%) of the 84 isolates
   exhibited 39 multidrug resistance patterns. Farm size significantly (P =
   0.032) affected the frequency of resistance to kanamycin across the
   countries. Overall, among the 14 serotypes of Salmonella tested,
   significant (P < 0.05) differences in frequency of resistance were
   detected to kanamycin, ampicillin, and SXT. Results suggest that the
   relatively high frequency of resistance to six of the antimicrobial
   agents (erythromycin, streptomycin, gentamycin, kanamycin, ampicillin,
   and tetracycline) tested and the multidrug resistance detected may pose
   prophylactic and therapeutic concerns for chicken layer farms in the
   three countries studied.

AB The southwestern tropical Pacific, part of a major pathway for waters
   feeding the Equatorial Undercurrent, is a region of important
   geochemical enrichment through land-ocean boundary exchange. Here we
   develop an original method based on the coupling between dynamical
   modeling and geochemical tracer data to identify regions of enrichment
   along the water pathways from the subtropics to the equator, and to
   allow a refined quantification of continental material fluxes. Neodymium
   data are interpreted with the help of modeled Lagrangian trajectories of
   an Ocean General Circulation Model. We reveal that upper and lower
   thermocline waters have different pathways together with different
   geochemical evolutions. The upper thermocline waters entering the
   Solomon Sea mainly originate from the central subtropical gyre, enter
   the Coral Sea in the North Vanuatu Jet and likely receive radiogenic
   neodymium from the basaltic island margins encountered along their
   route. The lower thermocline waters entering the Solomon Sea mainly
   originate from northeast of New Zealand and enter the Coral Sea in the
   North Caledonian Jet. Depletion of their neodymium content likely occurs
   when flowing along the Australian and Papua coasts. Downstream from the
   Solomon Sea, waters flowing along the Papua New Guinea margins near the
   Sepik river mouth become surprisingly depleted in their neodymium
   content in the upper thermocline while enriched in the lower
   thermocline. This coupled approach is proposed as strong support to
   interpret the origin of the equatorial Pacific natural fertilization
   through a better understanding of the circulation, important objectives
   of the international GEOTRACES and SPICE programs, respectively.

   One point raised by the analysis is that while national identities in
   these countries are often disrupted by subnational ethnic identities,
   strong nationalist discourses pervade representations of these
   companies. The nationalism apparent in responses to these companies is
   negative, reacting against perceived exploitation by foreigners through
   narratives of corporate wrongdoing. This article investigates the
   significance of this style of identification and questions whether the
   national identities entailed in negative representations of foreign
   investment constitute resistance against development or a disempowering
   victim identification that reifies a subordinate position in the world

AB Like many small island states, a number of Pacific Island countries
   (PICs) have ambitious renewable energy programmes in place. In some
   cases, the programmes include the objective of electricity generated
   from "100% renewable energy" by 2020 or 2025. The motivations for these
   ambitious programmes are commendable: to reduce dependency on imported
   oil fuels and to be seen to contribute towards reduction in greenhouse
   gas (GHG) emissions.
   The paper reviews renewable electricity generation policy and programmes
   in four PICs - Cook Islands, Niue, Tonga and Tuvalu - and implementation
   of the programmes to date. To illustrate the broader relevance of the
   issue, these programmes are compared with those of Maldives and
   Seychelles. Concerns identified include the ambitious goals and almost
   total reliance on solar photo-voltaic (PV) technology to supply
   electricity in small and remote islands. Our central argument is that
   dependency on oil imports will be replaced with dependency on technical
   support given the complex nature of PV technology compared with diesel
   particularly where high PV fractions are proposed. The lack of interest
   in biofuel, particularly coconut oil, is seen as a missed opportunity to
   use an endogenous energy resource that could form a useful part of the
   renewable energy mix.

   Methods. Descriptive study of the project for strengthening drug quality
   control in OMCLs of the Caribbean community (CARICOM).
   Results. Staff members of Argentina's National Administration for Drugs,
   Food, and Medical Technology (ANMAT) provided training to professionals
   from Guyana, Jamaica, Suriname, and Trinidad and Tobago. The project was
   funded by the Argentine Fund for South-South and Triangular Cooperation
   (FOAR) and coordinated by the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO).
   Documents on good laboratory practice (GLP) developed by the World
   Health Organization (WHO) and the Pan American Network for Drug
   Regulatory Harmonization (PANDRH) were reviewed, and the area of
   physical and chemical controls was strengthened, primarily for drugs to
   treat tuberculosis, malaria, and HIV/AIDS, all of which are
   strategically important to those countries.
   Conclusion. This type of collaboration makes it possible to share
   experiences, optimize resources, harmonize procedures and regulations,
   and strengthen human resource capacities. In addition, it is a valuable
   tool for reducing asymmetries in various areas among the different
   countries of our Region.

AB On land, biodiversity hotspots typically arise from concentrations of
   small-range endemics. For Indo-Pacific corals and reef fishes, however,
   centres of high species richness and centres of high endemicity are not
   concordant. Moreover ranges are not, on average, smaller inside the
   Central Indo-Pacific (CI-P) biodiversity hotspot. The disparity between
   richness and endemicity arises because corals and reef fishes have
   strongly skewed range distributions, with many species being very
   widespread. Consequently, the largest ranges overlap to generate peaks
   in species richness near the equator and the CI-P biodiversity hotspot,
   with only minor contributions from endemics. Furthermore, we find no
   relationship between the number of coral vs. fish endemics at locations
   throughout the Indo-Pacific, even though total richness of the two
   groups is strongly correlated. The spatial separation of centres of
   endemicity and biodiversity hotspots in these taxa calls for a
   two-pronged management strategy to address conservation needs.

AB Trinidad and Tobago is contributing to climate change by maintaining a
   model for food security that is based on corporate controls over food
   and agriculture. With policy documents, media sources, and ethnographic
   data, I argue that Trinidad and Tobago's food system is connected to
   national and transnational markets that firmly affix the country's food
   system to the fossil fuel economy. Three examples are provided. The
   first is the adoption of the World Bank's 'value chain' model for
   agriculture, which favours larger, economically (rather than
   ecologically) efficient farmers. The second is the recent state-led
   campaign to 'put T&T on your table', which overlooks the political
   prioritisation of industrial food imports exemplified by current
   policies to eliminate VAT (Value Added Tax) on industrial food imports.
   The final example is the November 2013 Memorandum of Understanding
   between Trinidad and Tobago and Guyana, under which Guyanese lands are
   being converted for the industrial production of corn, soya, and other
   crops for final processing and consumption in Trinidad and Tobago. While
   such policies are justified under the label of national and regional
   food security, I argue that they perpetuate a Caribbean-style corporate
   food regime that counteracts more climate-sensitive efforts to create
   sustainable producer-consumer networks. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All

AB Beach monitoring data are presented and show an average beach erosion
   trend of 0.5 m yr -1 in eight Caribbean islands over the period
   1985-2000, with elevated rates in those islands impacted by a higher
   number of hurricanes. The data are based on 5 to 15 years of continuous
   monitoring, conducted at three-month intervals, at 113 beaches (200
   profile sites) on eight islands, using standard methodology. The causes
   of the erosion are discussed and include anthropogenic factors, climate
   variability and projected climate change. Based on the Intergovernmental
   Panel on Climate Change projections for the Caribbean region, and the
   likely increase of anthropogenic stresses such as coastal development,
   it is likely that the beach erosion trend will continue and increase.
   Nonexclusive approaches to help beaches adapt to climate change include
   structural, planning or ecological measures. Two case studies
   illustrating climate change adaptation measures are discussed, one
   focuses on coastal planning measures in Anguilla and Nevis, and the
   second focuses on ecological measures, specifically the rehabilitation
   of a coastal forest in Puerto Rico. These case studies have not reached
   a stage where their effectiveness can be evaluated, however preliminary
   outcomes show that community-based climate change adaptation measures
   require careful planning such that the entire community is involved in a
   participatory manner and sufficient time is allocated for
   awareness-raising, information-sharing and discussion.

   new species
SO RECORDS OF THE AUSTRALIAN MUSEUM

EP +
SU 30
PD JUN 21 2006
PY 2006
AB Generic placements of the 43 species allocated to Bodianus in this study
   have previously been controversial, and the genus is more broadly
   defined here than before. Historically, taxonomic arrangements have
   merely resulted in the identification of small groups possessing obvious
   morphological modifications (e.g., Verreo and Euhypsocara) or have
   aligned species on the basis of primitive or convergent character
   states. Taxonomic assemblages based on the extent of cephalic
   squamation, degree of the formation of scaly basal sheaths on the dorsal
   and anal fins, and numbers of body scales as reflected in number of
   lateral-line scales can be polyphyletic. Until recently, these
   characters have been utilized as primary characters in many
   classifications. A phylogenetic analysis was undertaken for this study
   to construct a natural classification that groups species using
   currently accepted objective methodology.
   The genus Bodianus is defined here osteologically as that group of
   labrids whose adult members (with the possible exception of B.
   cylindriatus and B. thoracotaeniatus) possess a prominent frontal shelf
   on the neurocranium, posteriorly roofing a distinct medial
   ethmoid-frontal depression, and a sharply angled anteroventral profile
   of the dentary with an interdigitating joint at the symphysis. In this
   genus the ethmoid-frontal depression is distinctive in being formed
   primarily by the ventral deflection of the anterior end of the frontals,
   the undersurface of the depression in turn being overlapped by the
   posterior flange of the medial ethmoid (Gomon, 1997: figs 17, 20c, 21).
   The species of the genus Bodianus are separable from those of the
   closely related genera Xiphocheilus and Choerodon that appear to have
   convergently developed an ethmoid-frontal depression and an analogous
   association with the posterior flange of the medial ethmoid (but no
   anterior frontal shelf, no sharply angled anteroventral profile on the
   dentary and no interdigitating symphyseal joint), in having more
   numerous dorsal-fin rays (XII, 10 or 11, versus XII, 8 or XIII, 7), more
   numerous anal-fin rays (III, 11 or 12, versus 111, 9 or 10, rarely 11),
   more numerous vertebrae (11 + 17, versus 10 + 17, rarely 11 + 16) and
   more numerous lateral-line scales (29-42 + 2, versus 27 + 2).
   Bodianus is represented in all warm oceans, with the greatest diversity
   in the Indo-West Pacific. Although most species are found in relatively
   shallow tropical waters, a few occur at greater depths, and some have a
   warm temperate distribution.

EP 6
PD 1994-Mar
PY 1994
AB The English-speaking Caribbean is in transition toward communicable
   disease health patterns seen in the more developed world. Structural
   adjustment policies in recent years have weakened control measures, such
   as water supply and sanitation, as illustrated by recent outbreaks of
   typhoid fever in Jamaica (1990-1991), increased malaria incidence in
   Suriname and Guyana (with temporary importation into southern Trinidad
   in 1991), an upswing in tuberculosis in some countries, and the
   occurrence of cholera outbreaks in Belize, Suriname, and Guyana. The
   emergence of epidemic cholera throughout most of Latin America in 1991,
   and Caribbean mainland countries in 1992, aroused concern. Deteriorating
   socioeconomic conditions and the consequent communicable disease risk
   underscored the absence of communicable disease control in the Caribbean
   Cooperation in Health (CCH) strategy which was adopted in 1986 by the
   countries of the Caribbean Community. The Caribbean Epidemiology Center
   (CAREC) offered the following analysis: At least four out of seven CCH
   priorities already directly address critical aspects of communicable
   disease control, and therefore the question arises whether communicable
   disease control should be recognized as an explicit CCH priority. Beyond
   cholera and the diseases already represented in the CCH strategy, there
   are only a few other communicable diseases that warrant specific
   attention at this time: tuberculosis; leprosy, which CAREC member
   countries may want to eradicate; and leptospirosis, a zoonosis
   (communicable disease of animals transmissible to humans) thought to be
   the most frequent disease of this type in the Caribbean. These three
   conditions are insufficient to justify a distinct communicable disease
   grouping within CCH. However, if all communicable diseases of public
   health importance were to be grouped together (AIDS/STD,
   vaccine-preventable diseases, food- and waterborne diseases,
   vector-borne diseases), such a group would be important enough to
   justify a distinct priority category, with several major subcategories.

AB A more traditional lifestyle, especially with respect to diet and
   exercise, is needed to address the alarming rates of obesity, heart
   disease and diabetes in Pacific Island countries and indigenous
   communities in northern Australia. Leafy vegetables should play an
   important role but are often regarded as "low status" foods and have
   received little research attention. This study found that, although
   certain leafy vegetables are popular in some countries, particularly
   Solomon Islands and Tonga, there is little knowledge of their health
   benefits. Leaf samples were collected in Solomon Islands, Samoa, Tonga,
   Kiribati, North Queensland and the Torres Strait Islands and minerals,
   carotenoids and polyphenols were analysed. To study genotype-environment
   interaction, different species growing at the same location (same soil)
   and common species growing at multiple locations (different soils) were
   included in the survey. The data, together with flavour and popularity,
   were used to make a "Top 12" nutritious leafy vegetable factsheet
   series, which was distributed in participating countries and published
   online (www.aciar.gov.au/News2013July). Outstanding species included
   Abelmoschus manihot (aibika, bele), Polyscias spp. (ete), Sauropus
   androgynus (sweetleaf), Moringa oleifera (drumstick tree) and Basella
   alba (creeping spinach). Aibika was high in iron, zinc, magnesium,
   manganese, protein and lutein; sweetleaf was high in iron, zinc,
   calcium, magnesium, manganese, sulphur, lutein, b-carotene and protein;
   ete was high in zinc and calcium and grows well on alkaline coral soils;
   drumstick was high in b-carotene, sulphur and selenium, and creeping
   spinach was high in magnesium and polyphenols. Reliable provision of
   quality germplasm, more nutrition education, including school food
   gardens which feature the most nutritious of the vegetables, and value
   chain research to improve shelf life and delivery of nutrients to
   consumers are recommended.

AB Pacific Island countries have large pig and poultry populations. Yet
   little is known about patterns of contact between animals and how this
   influences disease spread in these islands. The objectives of this study
   were to examine farmer practices and the movements of pig and poultry
   within the Pacific Islands using questionnaires and social network
   analysis (SNA) tools to understand disease spread in the region.
   Questionnaire-based surveys were conducted in Fiji, Papua New Guinea
   (PNG), Solomon Islands and Vanuatu with interviews of 310 pig farmers
   and 491 poultry farmers. Pacific Island farmers were found to have few
   animals (median = 7 pigs/farm, IQR 4-12), (median = 50 chicken/farm, IQR
   23-52), (median = 10 ducks/farm, IQR 4-25), (median = 12 Muscovy
   ducks/farm, IQR 7-28) and a diversified number of species. A large
   proportion of farmers (44.6-1.3%) do not implement any preventive or
   control measures, yet the majority (80.6-88%) did not experience any
   animal diseases over the past 12 months. Most farmers never ask for
   veterinary care, never engage in laboratory testing and do not report
   when their animals show clinical signs. Many pig farmers (31.8%) trade
   within their communities only and sell (24.5%) directly to consumers
   which reduces the risk of diseases spreading. Our results show an
   association between farmers that report having had disease on their farm
   in the past 12 months and movements of animals on and off their farms.
   The capitals of the studied provinces in PNG, Vanuatu and Solomon
   Islands were identified as the most connected nodes of both pig and
   poultry trade, while Fiji networks appeared much less connected. Our
   study found that farmer practices increased the risk of disease spread,
   but this was currently limited by trading practices. The SNA results
   serve as a basis for more targeted disease surveillance and better use
   of available resources for disease prevention and control.

AB National greenhouse gas (GHG) inventories are essential for public
   policy planning to mitigate GHG emissions. They provide critical
   information and enhance environmental integrity in planning and
   development of GHG mitigation policy.
   The characteristics of a high quality inventory are that it follows good
   practice according to the IPCC guidelines. The key components of good
   practice are that the inventory is transparent to others, has accurate
   and complete emissions estimates for all gases, sources and sinks; has
   consistent application of methods across time; and is comparable to
   inventories from other countries [1]. While developed countries struggle
   with implementation of good practice, most can produce reasonably high
   quality inventories [2]. However, the task is more challenging in low
   lying pacific island countries. Some of the specific challenges include:
   lack of clarity on roles and responsibilities of agencies in preparing
   inventories; small teams with limited resources; difficulty in retaining
   expertise; incomplete or non-existent activity data; inconsistent data
   between inventories; absence of an archiving system for previous
   inventories; no QA/QC plan [3].
   As part of the UN-REDD Programme project on "Strengthening Regional
   Support to National Forest Monitoring Systems for REDD+ in the Pacific"
   a Regional Monitoring System has been developed to support low lying
   pacific island countries (Republic of Palau, Tuvalu, Cook Islands,
   Tonga, Republic of Kiribati, and Federated States of Micronesia). Using
   the Republic of Palau as a case study, we present this system and focus
   on four main challenges; 1) improving activity data compilation through
   systematic land use assessment 2) application of simple land use mapping
   algorithms 3) application of a regional geo-spatial portal to support
   improved data management 4) application of open-source land use analysis
   systems to help manage and analyze inventory data.

   period 1981-2013. The second mode reflecting higher rainfall in
   July-October season between Martinique and Grenada is the focus of this
   study. Higher rainfall corresponds with a weakened trade wind and
   boundary current along the southern edge of the Caribbean. This quells
   the coastal upwelling off Venezuela and builds the freshwater plume east
   of Trinidad. There is corresponding upper easterly wind flow that
   intensifies passing tropical waves. During a storm event over the
   Antilles on 4-5 October 2010, there was inflow from east of Guyana where
   low salinity and high sea temperatures enable surplus latent heat
   fluxes. A N-S convective rain band forms similar to 500 km east of the
   cyclonic vortex. Many features at the weather timescale reflect the
   seasonal correlation and composite difference maps and El Nino Southern
   Oscillation (ENSO) modulation of oceanic inter-basin transfers.

AB Small Islands Developing States (SIDS) are isolated and surrounded by
   ocean. The generation and use of energy resources are two very important
   aspects for the development of SIDS. Unfortunately, most of SIDS do not
   use their potential in respect of energy resources, and they as a result
   have to depend on the import of fossil fuels in order to meet their
   energy needs. This increases the overall vulnerability of SIDS as they
   have to depend on the rising or fluctuating fossil fuels prices. Some
   SIDS, especially in the geographically dispersed Pacific region, do not
   have proper access to energy whereas other SIDS struggle more with
   energy security issue. At the same time, SIDS are most vulnerable to the
   impacts and effects of climate change, as they are among the ones to be
   most severely affected in case of natural calamities and sea-level rise.
   Drawing on experiences from Fiji and Mauritius, this paper explains core
   elements related to energy access and security in SIDS, contextualizes
   and discusses barriers and list some of the strategies that may be used
   to ensure access to and a continuous supply of energy in SIDS. A
   situational analysis of two SIDS outlines their current energy situation
   and compares their energy policies to globally accepted criteria for
   SIDS policies as well as with each other. It is claimed that the
   diverging energy performances of Fiji and Mauritius cannot be explained
   by policies differences. The reasons for the varying energy performances
   may therefore lie in the administrative and institutional mechanisms
   used by the two countries in implementing their energy policies.
   Finally, to enable SIDS to reduce their overall vulnerability and become
   truly sustainable islands, it is recommended to undertake careful
   assessments of the particular local contexts under which island energy
   regimes operate. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The present study documents a high tsunami hazard in the Caribbean
   region, with several thousands of lives lost in tsunamis and associated
   earthquakes since the XIXth century. Since then, the coastal population
   of the Caribbean and the Central West Atlantic region has grown
   significantly and is still growing. Understanding this hazard is
   therefore essential for the development of efficient mitigation
   measures. To this end, we report a regional tsunami exposure assessment
   based on potential and credible seismic and non-seismic tsunamigenic
   sources. Regional tsunami databases have been compiled and reviewed, and
   on this basis five main scenarios have been selected to estimate the
   exposure. The scenarios comprise two M(w)8 earthquake tsunamis (north of
   Hispaniola and east of Lesser Antilles), two subaerial/submarine volcano
   flank collapse tsunamis (Montserrat and Saint Lucia), and one tsunami
   resulting from a landslide on the flanks of the Kick'em Jenny submarine
   volcano (north of Grenada). Offshore tsunami water surface elevations as
   well as maximum water level distributions along the shore lines are
   computed and discussed for each of the scenarios. The number of exposed
   people has been estimated in each case, together with a summary of the
   tsunami exposure for the earthquake and the landslide tsunami scenarios.
   For the earthquake scenarios, the highest tsunami exposure relative to
   the population is found for Guadeloupe (6.5%) and Antigua (7.5%), while
   Saint Lucia (4.5%) and Antigua (5%) have been found to have the highest
   tsunami exposure relative to the population for the landslide scenarios.
   Such high exposure levels clearly warrant more attention on dedicated
   mitigation measures in the Caribbean region. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All

AB The ability of 35 models from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project
   Phase 5 (CMIP5) to simulate the western Pacific (WP) monsoon is
   evaluated over four representative regions around Timor, New Guinea, the
   Solomon Islands and Palau. Coupled model simulations are compared with
   atmosphere-only model simulations (with observed sea surface
   temperatures, SSTs) to determine the impact of SST biases on model
   performance. Overall, the CMIP5 models simulate the WP monsoon better
   than previous-generation Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 3
   (CMIP3) models, but some systematic biases remain. The atmosphere-only
   models are better able to simulate the seasonal cycle of zonal winds
   than the coupled models, but display comparable biases in the rainfall.
   The CMIP5 models are able to capture features of interannual variability
   in response to the El Nino-Southern Oscillation. In climate projections
   under the RCP8.5 scenario, monsoon rainfall is increased over most of
   the WP monsoon domain, while wind changes are small. Widespread rainfall
   increases at low latitudes in the summer hemisphere appear robust as a
   large majority of models agree on the sign of the change. There is less
   agreement on rainfall changes in winter. Interannual variability of
   monsoon wet season rainfall is increased in a warmer climate,
   particularly over Palau, Timor and the Solomon Islands. A subset of the
   models showing greatest skill in the current climate confirms the
   overall projections, although showing markedly smaller rainfall
   increases in the western equatorial Pacific. The changes found here may
   have large impacts on Pacific island countries influenced by the WP
   monsoon.

AB Marine Heteroptera, or true bugs, are ubiquitous but rarely recognized
   elements of tropical marine ecosystems worldwide, reaching their highest
   level of diversification in the southwestern Pacific. During the current
   study, collections of marine Heteroptera were made at 41 sampling
   stations in Milne Bay Province of far eastern Papua New Guinea between
   April 2002 and January 2004. The sampling stations included sites in and
   around Milne Bay itself and on the immediately adjacent islands of
   Killerton, Iabama, Nuakata, Sariba, Lesimano, Sideia, and Basilaki, as
   well as in the D'Entrecasteaux Islands (Fergusson, Normanby), the
   Louisiade Archipelago (Panatinane, Tagula, Rossel, Wola, Misima), the
   Engineer Group (Tubetube), the Conflict Group (Irai), the Marshall
   Bennett Islands (Woodlark), and Egum Atoll (Yanaba). A total of 29
   species in 10 genera of marine Heteroptera were collected, including the
   following new taxa described herein: Ocheovelia nov. gen.., with type
   species Ocheovelia heissi nov. sp..; Hermatobates kula nov. sp..;
   Halovelia huniye nov. sp..; Halovelia misima nov. sp..; and Xenobates
   kanakopi nov. sp.. In addition, a male neotype from the Zamboanga area
   of Mindanao, Philippines, is designated for Hermatobates marchei
   COUTIERE & MARTIN, and the following new combinations are proposed:
   Ocheovelia anderseni (LANSBURY) and Ocheovelia solomon (ANDERSEN); both
   of these species were previously held in the genus Halovelia. Based on
   these surveys, Milne Bay Province supports one of the most diverse
   marine Heteroptera biotas recorded from any area on earth. With an area
   of 265,000 km2, this province occupies only 0.037 % of the earth's total
   area (and only 0.052 % of earth's water area), yet it supports 16.5 % of
   the world's known marine Gerromorpha. In terms of local species
   richness, Milne Bay proper, the islands east of China Strait, Fergusson
   and Normanby islands in the D'Entrecasteaux group, and Rossel Island in
   the Louisiades supported the highest number of species (16, 16, 12 and I
   I respectively), apparently due to their habitat complexity resulting
   from a combination of large, reef-bound lagoons or platform reefs
   coupled with rocky island shores bearing fringing mangrove estuaries. By
   contrast, richness was lowest at Egum and Conflict atolls (3 and 4
   species respectively), which have large lagoons and fringing reefs, but
   lack estuarine and mangrove habitats or steep rocky shores. Species
   richness was intermediate at sites on Tagula (9 species), Misima (9
   species), and Woodlark (7 species), all of which uniformly support
   mangrove estuaries and have varying degrees of fringing reef and lagoon
   development, but are more isolated from the main body of New Guinea.
   Beta diversity was moderately high within Milne Bay Province, with no
   one site supporting more than 16 of the 29 aggregate species collected
   during this marine survey program. The collections reported here
   substantially extend the known ranges of a many marine Heteroptera
   species. Our collections of Halobates proavus WHITE apparently represent
   a new island record for New Guinea. Within Papua New Guinea, the ranges
   of Halobates calyptus HERRING, Halobates hayanus WHITE, Halobates
   maculatus SCHADOW, Halobates princeps WHITE, Thetibates serena
   (LANSBURY), Halovelia annemariae ANDERSEN, Halovelia bergrothi ESAKI,
   and Haloveloides papuensis (ESAKI) are extended far to the southeast, by
   approximately 800-1000 km. The ranges of Halovelia corallia ANDERSEN,
   Halovelia novoguinensis ANDERSEN, and Xenobates caudatus ANDERSEN &
   WEIR, all of which were previously known only from Motupore Island near
   Port Moresby, are extended approximately 800 km eastward. The ranges of
   Xenobates mangrove ANDERSEN & WEIR and Xenobates ovatus ANDERSEN & WEIR,
   known until now only from coastal Queensland, are extended approximately
   800-1000 km northeastward. The documented range of Hermatobates marchei
   COUTIERE & MARTIN, previously reported only from the type locality
   Palawan in the Philippines, is extended to the southeast by more than
   4000 km; previous surveys by the authors had also revealed the presence
   of this species on Mindanao and Palau, and these records are provided
   herein. A biogeographic discussion identifies four major patterns of
   distribution among the marine Heteroptera of eastern New Guinea: south
   coast taxa that extend eastward along the northern margin of the Coral
   Sea; north coast taxa that extend southeastward from the Huon Peninsula
   area to the D'Entrecasteaux Islands, the Louisiade Archipelago, and
   occasionally the Bismarcks and Solomons; regionally endemic taxa that
   occur in the Bismarcks, Solomons, and on the northeast coast of New
   Guinea; and locally endemic taxa confined to the region between Milne
   Bay and the Louisiade Archipelago. Tables are provided giving a
   checklist of all taxa, and their individual island distributions within
   the region under study.

AB The Coral Triangle (CT) includes some or all of the land and seas of six
   countries: Indonesia, Malaysia, Papua New Guinea, the Philippines, the
   Solomon Islands, and Timor-Leste (CT6). It covers only 1.1% of the
   world's area, but is the global hotspot for marine biodiversity and a
   rich spawning area for tuna. One-third of the CT6 population and
   millions more from outside the region are dependent on these resources.
   However, a range of human pressures threaten the biological health and
   diversity in the CT, affecting the food security and livelihoods of
   these people. A set of Crisis Sentinel Indicators (CSI) has been
   proposed to discuss the current state of affairs of the Coral Triangle
   based on the three dimensions of sustainability: Ecological,
   Socioeconomic, and Governance indicators. Furthermore, a
   Pressure-State-Response (PSR) analysis was performed for each CT6
   country, using the three dimensions of sustainability, to capture and

AB Cultural and social relations that are constitutive of alternative ways
   of conceiving and practicing development exemplify "living other-wise"
   (Shilliam 2015, 8) to the central premises of the global development
   agenda. That is to say, communities who are actively trying to create
   sustainable alternatives have been contesting the dominant vision of
   development. In this article, I explore the small, fledgling Bushmen
   Farming Network of Malaita, Solomon Islands, who question the dominant
   vision of agricultural development and are attempting to create a small,
   dynamic, and self-conscious alternative that seeks to enhance
   self-reliance and local production. My analysis highlights the
   persistence of social values and relations other-wise and demonstrates
   their political significance for development. This attempt to organize
   for living other-wise is an interesting and important response for
   sustainable development in communities caught between the lure of
   mainstream development and more socially oriented cultural indigenous
   values.

   Monitor 2017, the authors reviewed legislation, country reports,
   articles, and the databases of WHO and the World Trade Organization to
   identify relevant regulatory measures and to establish the extent of
   implementation in the selected countries. Obesity prevalence ranged from
   25.9% in Dominica to 41.1% in Tonga. The principal diet-related measures
   implemented by the selected countries were fiscal measures, such as
   sugar-sweetened beverage taxes and import duties to encourage greater
   consumption of healthy foods. Governmental action was weakest in the
   area of restrictions on marketing of unhealthy foods. If they are to
   reduce their current high rates of obesity and associated NCDs,
   Caribbean and Pacific states need to intensify implementation of
   diet-related regulatory measures, particularly in the area of marketing
   of unhealthy foods and beverages to children. Key implementation
   challenges include financial and staffing constraints and the need for
   increased political will to counter industry opposition and to allocate
   adequate financial resources to keep advancing this agenda.

AB The Coral Triangle Marine Protected Area System aspires to become a
   region-wide, comprehensive, ecologically representative and well-managed
   system of marine protected areas (MPAs) and MPA networks. The
   development of this system will proceed primarily through the
   implementation of ecological, social, and governance MPA networks at the
   sub-national scale. We describe six case studies that exemplify
   different approaches taken to develop MPA networks in the Coral Triangle
   region at different scales: Nusa Penida in Indonesia; Tun Mustapha Park
   in Malaysia; Kimbe Bay in Papua New Guinea; Verde Island Passage in the
   Philippines; The Lauru Ridges to Reefs Protected Area Network in
   Choiseul, Solomon Islands; and Nino Konis Santana Park in Timor Leste.
   Through synthesis of these case studies, we identify five common themes
   that contributed to successful outcomes: (1) the need for
   multi-stakeholder and cross-level management institutions; (2) the value
   of integrating cutting-edge science with local knowledge and
   community-based management; (3) the importance of building local
   capacity; (4) using multiple-use zoning to balance competing objectives;
   and (5) participation in learning and governance networks. These lessons
   will be invaluable in guiding future efforts to expand the Coral
   Triangle Marine Protected Area System, and provide important insights
   for MPA practitioners elsewhere.

AB Mitochondrial DNA control region haplotypes of immature hawksbills
   feeding in Tobago waters and adult females nesting on the beaches of
   Tobago were characterized. Eleven haplotypes were documented among
   foraging aggregations and six haplotypes among nesting females,
   including two which were previously of unknown natal origin. The Tobago
   rookery is genetically distinct from all other rookeries in the region
   characterized to date. Significant genetic differentiation was found
   between the foraging aggregations on the windward and leeward sides of
   Tobago. Within the rookery, greater diversity was detected among samples
   from the North-East coast compared to samples from the South-West coast,
   however no significant difference was detected based on pairwise F-ST.
   Mixed stock analysis was conducted to estimate the natal origins of
   immature hawksbills foraging in Tobago waters and the contribution of
   the Tobago rookery to regional foraging aggregations using rookery size
   as a constraint. The analysis estimated that the Tobago foraging
   aggregation is mostly composed of animals originating from Cuba,
   Barbados (Leeward Coast) and Puerto Rico, though this represents only a
   small fraction of the production from these rookeries. The impact of
   harvest of juveniles in Tobago is likely to be distributed across the
   region and not concentrated on any particular rookery. A significant
   proportion of individuals from the Tobago rookery contributes to the
   foraging aggregation of the Cayman Islands, and a large proportion of
   both the Cayman Islands and Puerto Rico foraging aggregations are
   derived from the Tobago rookery. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights

AB Milne Bay Province (MBP) in Papua New Guinea is a priority seascape in
   the Coral Triangle marine biodiversity hotspot. Goal 4 of the Coral
   Triangle Initiative on Coral Reefs, Fisheries and Food Security promotes
   adaptation planning for small island ecosystems and communities
   threatened by climate change, but information to identify vulnerable
   islands and priority interventions is limited. This study adapted the
   Millennium Ecosystem Assessment (2005) framework in MBP with regional
   stakeholders to project trends in harvested or cultivated 'provisioning'
   ecosystem goods and services (EGS), human wellbeing, drivers of change
   and necessary management strategies, based on their tacit knowledge. In
   2010 five island subregions which are susceptible to food insecurity
   were assessed. Workshop participants identified freshwater, garden food
   crops, coral, beche-de-mer, reef fish and sharks as the most important
   EGS in all subregions. Terrestrial EGS contributed 43% of aggregated
   ecosystem-derived well-being, and marine EGS 57%. By 2030 the overall
   condition of EGS was projected to decline by > 50%. The primary driver
   in all subregions was human population growth, and climate change
   impacts were predicted in only two subregions. Improved garden and
   agricultural productivity and population control were the highest ranked
   management strategies. Population relocation was also prioritised for
   two subregions where human carrying capacities may soon be exceeded.
   Although none of the strategies addressed climate change directly, all
   could yield climate adaptation and marine conservation co-benefits by
   enhancing ecosystem-based adaptation and community adaptive capacity. It
   is suggested that there is a 20-30 year 'adaptation window' in which to
   address population growth, which otherwise will continue to erode the
   capacity of communities and ecosystems to cope with potentially extreme
   climate impacts after mid-century. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

   the need to increase efficiency in the use, distribution, and production
   of energy in the Caribbean region. The empirical results of this Paper
   suggest the following: first, the three Caribbean countries provide
   evidence of shot-run bi-directional from energy consumption to real
   gross domestic product per capita. Second, the forecasts with A BVAR
   model indicate that significant growth in energy demand could be
   expected in Haiti, Jamaica, and Trinidad and Tobago until at least 2010.
   Third, the increased growth in energy consumption suggests the need for
   long-term commitments from Caribbean countries to undertake a series of
   policy, economic, market, and research and development measures to
   advance the adoption and deployment of new energy technologies. (c) 2007

AB Background: Fish is an essential and traditional element in the diet of
   most Caribbean people. However it also contains methylmercury which can
   have severe effects on fetal neurodevelopment. The objective of this
   study was to assess the fish intake of a selected group of pregnant
   women from Jamaica and Trinidad & Tobago and evaluate prenatal mercury
   exposure, using the placenta as a biomarker.
   Method: Food frequency questionnaires and placental samples were
   obtained from participating parturients at the time of delivery at the
   University Hospital of the West Indies in Kingston, Jamaica (N =100,
   from November 2012 to March 2013) and the Mt Hope Women's hospital in St
   Joseph, Trinidad & Tobago (N = 30, in June 2015). The participants were
   asked to identify the species of fish and the frequency of consumption.
   Placental samples were analysed for mercury using cold vapour atomic
   absorption.
   Results: The fish consumption preferences for pregnant women, varies
   based on the marine fish catch production of each country. The main fish
   species that contributed to the highest estimated methyl mercury
   exposure in Jamaica and Trinidad & Tobago were cod and shark,
   respectively. There was a weak association between maternal fish intake
   and placental mercury concentrations. The mean placental mercury
   concentrations in Jamaica and Trinidad & Tobago were 0.74 +/- 0.5 mu
   g/kg and 1.46 +/- 0.6 mu g/kg, wet weight respectively.
   Conclusion: The results from this study showed an influence of Caribbean
   fish intake preferences on mercury exposure and thus a recommendation
   for continuous bio-monitoring for public health purposes. (C) 2016

AB While there might be differences in details, any definition of
   'sustainability' must include an element that remains similar over time.
   For example, this applies to the catches of coral reef fisheries, which
   cannot be sustainable if exhibiting a strong ascending or descending
   trend. Thus, despite claims of the efficacy of 'data-less' management,
   at least time series of the catch of coral reef fisheries must be known
   for valid inferences on their status to be drawn. By contrasting the
   official and the 'reconstructed' coral reef catches of four small island
   states (Fiji and Tonga in the Pacific, and Jamaica and St Kitts & Nevis
   in the Caribbean), we show, however, that official catch data, as made
   available to and by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United
   Nations (FAO) not only strongly underestimate catches (from 4 to 17
   times for 1950-2010), but also suggest increasing catch trends in 3 of 4
   cases, that is, the very opposite of the trend resulting from the
   bottom-up catch reconstructions. Some implications of these findings,
   which we think have general currency, are presented.

AB Understanding how genetic diversity is maintained across patchy marine
   environments remains a fundamental problem in marine biology. The Coral
   Triangle, located in the Indo-West Pacific, is the centre of marine
   biodiversity and has been proposed as an important source of genetic
   diversity for remote Pacific reefs. Several studies highlight
   Micronesia, a scattering of hundreds of small islands situated within
   the North Equatorial Counter Current, as a potentially important
   migration corridor. To test this hypothesis, we characterized the
   population genetic structure of two ecologically important congeneric
   species of reef-building corals across greater Micronesia, from Palau to
   the Marshall Islands. Genetic divergences between islands followed an
   isolation-by-distance pattern, with Acropora hyacinthus exhibiting
   greater genetic divergences than A.digitifera, suggesting different
   migration capabilities or different effective population sizes for these
   closely related species. We inferred dispersal distance using a
   biophysical larval transport model, which explained an additional 15-21%
   of the observed genetic variation compared to between-island
   geographical distance alone. For both species, genetic divergence
   accumulates and genetic diversity diminishes with distance from the
   Coral Triangle, supporting the hypothesis that Micronesian islands act
   as important stepping stones connecting the central Pacific with the
   species-rich Coral Triangle. However, for A.hyacinthus, the species with
   lower genetic connectivity, immigration from the subequatorial Pacific
   begins to play a larger role in shaping diversity than input from the
   Coral Triangle. This work highlights the enormous dispersal potential of
   broadcast-spawning corals and identifies the biological and physical
   drivers that influence coral genetic diversity on a regional scale.

   methodology coupled with perceptual cost effectiveness assessment, based
   on primary data obtained from an expert panel. Findings suggest that a
   voluntary incentive policy with intervention in the consumer market such
   as a product subsidy possibly coupled with a product exchange scheme in
   phased approach towards a mandatory obligation to energy efficient
   lighting products could be the way forward. Findings also suggest
   suitability of a third-party conformity assessment approach whereby
   manufacturers/suppliers/importers will require certification for energy
   efficient lighting products by an approved, accredited entity before or
   upon local market entry. The RIA is useful to government policy makers
   seeking to justify and prioritize their available options for efficient

   also introduces the RIA as an approach that should be institutionalized
   in the Caribbean region as a tool for data driven and evidence based

AB Canarium indicum is an indigenous tree of the lowland forests of
   Melanesia (Papua New Guinea, Solomon Islands, Vanuatu) and parts of
   Indonesia producing edible nuts, commercial timber and some minor
   products. For thousands of years the nuts have been culturally important
   and a traditional food. Since the early 1990s there have been a number
   of projects aimed at the wider commercialization of the species, with
   mixed success. This review evaluates the biophysical and socio-economic
   literature and suggests how the domestication and commercialization
   processes could be taken forwards to improve the livelihoods of rural
   households in Melanesia. Many of the issues facing the domestication and
   commercialization of C. indicum nuts as an Agroforestry Tree Product
   (AFTP) are similar to those that will be important for the development
   of other AFTPs. Thus there are lessons that can be learnt from this
   species which make it a model for other agroforestry tree species.

AB Dietary intake surveys of rural and urban communities in three Pacific
   Island countries were conducted using an adjusted 24-hour dietary recall
   method. Dietary survey samples were drawn from noncommunicable disease
   surveys of Melanesians and Indians in Fiji, Micronesians in Kiribati and
   Melanesians in Vanuatu. Comparisons of total energy and macronutrient
   intakes and of obesity, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, serum
   cholesterol and physical activity levels revealed similar rural/urban
   trends. Urban subjects were more obese than rural ones, had higher
   prevalence rates of diabetes and hypertension, and generally had higher
   cholesterol levels. Rural subjects were leaner, suffered less from
   diabetes and hypertension, and had greater total energy intakes than
   urban dwellers. Rural people ate a greater proportion of carbohydrates,
   while urban subjects ate proportionally more protein and fat, apart from
   the outer Kiribati atolls with high coconut intakes. Rural subjects in
   all three studies had higher levels of physical activity. These studies
   provide persuasive evidence that exercise as well as diet has a
   significant effect on rural/urban differentials in obesity and
   noncommunicable disease, and that energy intake reflects energy
   expenditure.

AB During the period August to November 1999, mass mortalities of several
   species of reef-associated fish were reported at a number of islands in
   the southern Caribbean, including Tobago, Grenada, Barbados, St. Vincent
   and the Grenadines. Histopathological and bacteriological studies
   conducted in Barbados revealed that the fish died from severe
   disseminated bacteraemic disease caused by the pathogen Streptococcus
   iniae which had not previously been reported in the marine environment
   in the southern Caribbean. Analysis of satellite imagery indicated that
   a plume of water originating in the region of the Orinoco River, and
   characterised by high chlorophyll concentrations and low nocturnal
   oxygen levels, impacted on Barbados and the neighbouring islands at the
   time of the fish kill. It is suggested here that several atypical
   environmental conditions, including elevated sea water temperature, high
   phytoplankton concentration and reduced oxygen levels worked in concert
   to stress the fish and increase their susceptibility to S. iniae.

AB The role of AD 1300 climate change in widespread societal change in
   Palau and the Pacific Basin has recently been debated by Fitzpatrick
   (2010, 2011) and Nunn and Hunter-Anderson (2011). The central
   proposition examined here is the link between a sea-level driven food
   crisis and the outbreak of conflict, which is hypothesized in the AD
   1300 event model to have led people to shift from unprotected coastal
   parts of large islands (e.g. volcanic Babeldaob) to more readily
   defensible offshore islands (e.g. limestone 'Rock Islands') during the
   transition between the Medieval Warm Period (MWP) and the Little Ice Age
   (LIA). Revision of radiocarbon dates from village sites in the Rock
   Islands suggests instead that permanent settlements were established on
   small offshore islands during the MWP with village abandonment during
   the LIA. Palaeoclimate records from equatorial islands show that during
   the LIA Palau had less rainfall from the southward movement of the
   Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ). The abandonment of multiple
   limestone islands by a population estimated at 4000-6000 people may have
   been influenced by decreased precipitation and more tentatively from a
   decline in near-shore marine foods as a result of sea-level fall.

   primary character used by some recent authors for recognition of two
   owstoniine genera, with Sphenanthias Weber possessing the plesiomorphic
   lateral-line condition. Several other patterns also occur in these
   fishes bringing into question the phylogenetic significance of lateral
   line plasticity. Sexual dimorphism in pelvic fin lengths is also present

   the world. Apart from global climate change concerns, these high energy
   prices make it clear that alternative energy must be sourced for the

   reserves, Trinidad and Tobago has bolstered its economy and its
   expertise in offshore engineering and technology in the past five
   decades. Caribbean regional efforts to find ocean-based renewable energy
   resources can largely exploit the aforementioned advantages and
   opportunities in Trinidad and Tobago. The present work involves a
   collaboration between a team of engineers to collect and analyze oceanic
   data in Trinidad and Tobago, and a team of sustainability scholars to
   survey the maritime context of Trinidad and Tobago via the lens of
   sustainable development. This is done to appropriately contextualize
   Trinidad and Tobago, which is the territory via which Caribbean regional

AB Explorations by the German Research Vessel Sonne in the fore-arc and
   back-arc basins of the western Pacific Ocean have collected
   vestimentiferan tube worms from both warm vent and cold seep sites.
   Edison Seamount is a small volcanic cone on the southern flank of Lihir
   Island, in the Tabar-Feni island chain. Beds of vesicomyid clams on the
   summit (1450 m depth) are associated with hydrothermal effluent, whereas
   an uplifted scarp (1600 m depth) nearby is covered by low temperature
   gas-rich sediments. A methane anomaly has been detected in the water
   column above the scarp. The benthic fauna includes vestimentiferan
   tubeworms and bathymodiolid mussels. Bottom photographs show that the
   vestimentiferans occur singly or in small groups. Four specimens were
   collected by TV-guided grab. They are described as a new species of a
   new genus, related to the cold-seep genus Escarpia, of the family
   Escarpiidae. A single specimen obtained from the landward slope of the
   Java Trench (1500 m) is identified as the same species, extending its
   area of distribution by some 6000 km westward. Arcovestia ivanovi,
   already known from hydrothermal vents in the Manus Basin, has now been
   obtained from a hydrothermal site in the North Fiji Basin.

AB Small island developing states (SIDS) are distinct from other developing
   countries: they are particularly and comparatively more vulnerable to
   the impacts of climate change. Efforts to understand national-level
   vulnerability in these countries are limited. This paper helps to fill
   this gap and has two main aims. First, it identifies trends in
   national-level climate change adaptation among SIDS in the Caribbean
   region. Second, it identifies the limits to adaptation at the national
   level in these countries. In applying a resilience lens, and using
   summative content analysis techniques and semi-structured interviews
   with 26 senior policy-makers, this paper finds that Caribbean SIDS are
   primarily adapting to changes in hurricane, rainfall, and drought
   patterns. It also finds that most adaptations are being undertaken in
   the coastal zone and the water and agriculture sectors, and that there
   are many factors limiting national-level adaptation. The most commonly
   reported limit is financing, though not all policy-makers agree that
   financing is a limit. These findings are important for national SIDS
   governments and international donors and agencies that will be better
   able to identify and fill gaps in their adaptation actions and
   financing. This paper's findings also highlight the importance of
   depoliticising climate change and prioritising good governance,
   improving SIDS' access to international adaptation financing, and making
   the road to a climate-resilient future by walking.

AB In the Caribbean AIDS has become the leading cause of death among those
   aged 15-45. The homeless are at high risk due to the nexus of mobility,
   psychiatric disorders and substance use, particularly crack.
   Seventy-four homeless, out-of-treatment drug users were recruited in
   Saint Lucia and Trinidad to assess risk behaviour and healthcare needs.
   Information was collected in several domains: medical, mental health,
   substance use, sexual risk, and barriers to care. Ninety-five percent of
   the sample reported crack cocaine use within the previous 30 days.
   Approximately 35% of the sample had ever been diagnosed with a sexually
   transmitted disease and 25% of the sample reported being HIV+.
   Approximately 40% had a history of trading sex for crack or money. Due
   to the range of needs in this population, interventions should be
   multimodal. A focus on the individual, community, and structural levels
   is warranted to improve chances of program effectiveness.

AB Reliable information relevant to fisheries has been acquired directly
   from fishers in many parts of the world. In this study, we attempt to
   determine whether such information can be valuable in investigating the
   role of drifting objects in fisheries for pelagic species in the
   southeastern Caribbean by conducting a questionnaire survey of two
   hundred and fifty-three fishers from St. Lucia, Barbados, Grenada, St.
   Vincent and Tobago. The results indicate that drifting objects do
   attract fish and therefore play an important role in pelagic fisheries
   in the southeastern Caribbean. The role is seasonal, being greatest
   between January and March in all countries, but having a more extended
   seasonal duration in Grenada and Tobago. Drifting objects are prevalent
   in water which is green or brown in colour, rather than blue, and fish
   associate with both natural and anthropogenic drifting objects, with no
   apparent preference within or between these groups. Fishers actively
   seek and fish around drifting objects. Fishers from St. Lucia, Barbados,
   Grenada and Tobago deliberately deploy drifting objects constructed of
   naturally-occurring materials when targeting flyingfish. However, very
   few fishers deploy drifting objects to target large pelagics. In this
   study, the fisheries and biological-oceanographic information obtained
   from fishers was largely consistent with information reported in the
   literature, indicating that information obtained in this manner can be
   of considerable value to fisheries management in the region. (C) 1998

AB Advanced oxidation processes driven by solar energy can be an efficient
   method in removing organochlorine compounds from river water especially
   in tropical environments like the Caribbean region. The feasibility of
   solar photocatalytic degradation of an organochlorine compound, namely
   trichloroethanoic acid (TCA), which is commonly used in the Caribbean
   islands of Trinidad and Tobago, was separately assessed using titanium
   dioxide and zinc oxide as photocatalysts in suspended solution. Overall
   the prototype solar photoreactor operated and performed efficiently for
   the photodegradation of TCA. This study showed that a basic
   photocatalytic oxidation method for treating water using solar energy as
   the primary driver gives enhanced decomposition rates of the
   organochlorine compound when coupled to the additional application of
   the two separate semiconductor photocatalysts. The results further
   showed that for varying concentrations of TCA and photocatalysts alike,
   the organochlorine compound could be completely photocatalytically
   degraded using short exposure times under the applied influx of solar
   radiation. This means that this process could be optimised by judicious
   use of sensors so that dosage rates of the photocatalyst could be
   altered with variations in influent contamination levels, and the
   exposure time in the reactor could be altered according to daily
   variations in solar radiation intensity.

   development on freshwater, this article argues that the future survival
   of small island states and their societies also greatly depends on
   managing the impacts of development. Approaches which can concurrently
   strengthen the resilience of communities and their ecosystems will
   result in mutual benefits for both sustainable development and climate

AB This paper presents a technological review of permeable pavement systems
   (PPS) for applications in urban areas of small island developing states
   (SIDS). This review includes a literature survey of PPS, challenges and
   opportunities of climate change and urban development in SIDS, and key
   aspects worth considering for widespread acceptance and use of PPS in
   SIDS. SIDS is comprised of several nations located across the Atlantic,
   Pacific, and Indian Oceans, as well as the Caribbean, Mediterranean, and
   South China seas. They are particularly susceptible to the effects of
   climate change and increasing urbanization. Urban stormwater management
   and flooding are often serious challenges faced by authorities in most
   SIDS. PPS are resilient infrastructure which can assist in mitigating
   flooding by reducing runoff and peak flows and improving the landscape
   perviousness. PPS can further improve stormwater runoff quality to
   receiving natural waters by reducing pollutant loadings of suspended
   solids, heavy metals, and hydrocarbons. Unlike most territorial states,
   the geographical and geologically confined nature of most SIDS present
   unique parameters for consideration when designing permeable pavements
   for SIDS. This literature survey found that some of the most important
   parameters include traffic loads, cost, construction aggregate choice,
   and availability, permeability of existing soil at the intended
   location, depth of water table, potential for groundwater contamination,
   slope of the pavement, stormwater reuse option, clogging, maintenance,
   and support from policy makers. Continued practical research into the
   use of permeable pavements for urban runoff management in SIDS is
   on-going with the expectation of PPS being utilized in many SIDS.

   cetacean species prepared for consumption. We report high concentrations
   of total mercury and methyl-mercury in these tissues as compared to
   published data for other seafood products. Further, our findings
   indicate that the traditional preparation method most often used locally

AB Acid sulfate and related soils occur extensively in the Caribbean region
   in areas such as the Orinoco Delta, Guyana, Suriname, and Trinidad.  The
   aerial extent of such soils is likely to exceed 1.5 million hectares. 
   Included in the group are peaty soils, clay soils, and clay soils with
   buried organic layers.  Most of the soils are essentially only
   extensively used for grazing at present.  There have been attempts at
   more intensive agricultural development in Guyana, for example, but
   without adequate measures, failure and abandonment of reclaimed areas
   resulted.  In Trinidad, partial reclamation, consisting of drainage of
   an area, caused major disruptions of the agriculture which was based on
   a wet season rice crop with vegetables in the dry season.  Most acid
   sulfate soils in the region have a surface layer which does not qualify
   as a sulfuric horizon or as sulfidic materials.  These features occur
   primarily in sub-soils.
   There has been little research on reclamation and more intensive
   agricultural use of acid sulfate soils in the Caribbean region.  In some
   of the soils of Guyana and Trinidad, upwards of 50 tons per hectare of
   ground limestone are needed initially to appreciably reduce the effects
   of the high acidity which develops on draining, and the frequency and
   rate of future applications have not been worked out.  Where dilute sea
   water is available and its use can be controlled, repeated flooding and
   draining of acid sulfate soils have been used for reclamation.  However,
   due to the degree of water control needed, this method, although
   technically sound, has severe constraints.

   thyasirid and solemyid bivalves, and Pleurophopsis. A new early Miocene
   seep community from Cuba includes Pleurophopsis and the large lucinid

   Godineau River fauna consisting mainly of lucinid bivalves, and the
   limestone-hosted Freeman's Bay fauna consisting chiefly of
   Pleurophopsis, Bathymodiolus, and small gastropods; they are all dated
   as late Miocene. Four new seep communities of Oligocene to Miocene age
   are reported from Venezuela. They consist mainly of large globular
   lucinid bivalves including Meganodontia, and moderately sized vesicomyid
   bivalves. After the late Miocene many large and typical 'Cenozoic'
   lucinid genera disappeared from the Caribbean seeps and are today known
   only from the central Indo-Pacific Ocean. We speculate that the
   increasingly oligotrophic conditions in the Caribbean Sea after the
   closure of the Isthmus of Panama in the Pliocene may have been
   unfavorable for such large lucinids because they are only facultative
   chemosymbiotic and need to derive a significant proportion of their
   nutrition from suspended organic matter.

AB Present-day (1979-2003) and future (2075-2099) simulations of mean and
   extreme rainfall and temperature are examined using data from the
   Meteorological Research Institute super-high-resolution atmospheric
   general circulation model. Analyses are performed over the 20-km model
   grid for (1) a main Caribbean basin, (2) sub-regional zones, and (3)
   specific Caribbean islands. Though the model's topography underestimates
   heights over the eastern Caribbean, it captures well the present-day
   spatial and temporal variations of seasonal and annual climates.
   Temperature underestimations range from 0.1 A degrees C to 2 A degrees C
   with respect to the Japanese Reanalysis and the Climatic Research Unit
   datasets. The model also captures fairly well sub-regional scale
   variations in the rainfall climatology. End-of-century projections under
   the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change SRES A1B scenario indicate
   declines in rainfall amounts by 10-20 % for most of the Caribbean during
   the early (May-July) and late (August-October) rainy seasons relative to
   the 1979-2003 baselines. The early dry season (November-January) is also
   projected to get wetter in the far north and south Caribbean by
   approximately 10 %. The model also projects a warming of 2-3 A degrees C
   over the Caribbean region. Analysis of future climate extremes indicate
   a 5-10 % decrease in the simple daily precipitation intensity but no
   significant change in the number of consecutive dry days for Cuba,
   Jamaica, southern Bahamas, and Haiti. There is also indication that the
   number of hot days and nights will significantly increase over the main
   Caribbean basin.

AB Small populations are dominated by unique patterns of variance, largely
   characterized by rapid drift of allele frequencies. Although the
   variance components of genetic datasets have long been recognized, most
   population genetic studies still treat all sampling locations equally
   despite differences in sampling and effective population sizes. Because
   excluding the effects of variance can lead to significant biases in
   historical reconstruction, variance components should be incorporated
   explicitly into population genetic analyses. The possible magnitude of
   variance effects in small populations is illustrated here via a case
   study of Y-chromosome haplogroup diversity in the Vanuatu Archipelago.
   Deme-based modelling is used to simulate allele frequencies through
   time, and conservative confidence bounds are placed on the accumulation
   of stochastic variance effects, including diachronic genetic drift and
   contemporary sampling error. When the information content of the dataset
   has been ascertained, demographic models with parameters falling outside
   the confidence bounds of the variance components can then be accepted
   with some statistical confidence. Here I emphasize how aspects of the
   demographic history of a population can be disentangled from stochastic
   variance effects, and I illustrate the extreme roles of genetic drift
   and sampling error for many small human population datasets.

AB Nearshore (mostly <= 1 m) samples of marine sediments around Nevis were
   collected between 1990 and 1994 and examined for their foraminiferal
   fauna. Tests of the larger foraminifera Archaias angulatus formed 9.3%
   of all foraminifera recovered. However, as a percentage of individual
   assemblages they were most abundant (up to 46.9%) along the northern
   coast. This is attributed to winnowing of specimens of smaller species
   from the north coast during storms, when currents are funnelled along
   the channel that separates Nevis from St. Kitts. The mean percentage of
   A. angulatus altered to glauconite was higher along the western, leeward
   coast (64.8%) than along the northern and eastern, windward coasts
   (17.7%), indicating that pore waters in the lee of the island are
   dysoxic. This is due to low wave energies along the leeward coast, which
   allow the burial and oxidation of organic carbon. These results have
   implications for the island's development: pollutants will accumulate
   preferentially in sediments along the leeward coast.

AB Zoanthus is a genus of colonial cnidarians very common in shallow
   subtropical and tropical rocky and coral reef ecosystems around the
   world. Some species, such as Zoanthus solanderi and Z. sociatus, can
   coexist and cover extensive areas in the subtidal zone of some areas in
   the Caribbean. We report on a Zoanthus zone' in Western Africa in a bay
   in the north of Maio Island in the Cabo Verde Archipelago, discovered in
   October 2014. Molecular analyses showed that the Maio Island carpet is
   formed by Z. sociatus and Z. solanderi. Similar aggregations have been
   reported from the other side of the Atlantic Ocean in the Caribbean.
   This work demonstrates the presence of the Zoanthus zone' in the Central

AB The genus Canarium (Burseraceae) contains approximately 100 species,
   mostly found in tropical Asia and the Pacific. In the Pacific, C.
   indicum is widely utilized for its edible nuts. Nuts are mostly traded
   fresh in roadside and village markets, in Papua New Guinea, the Solomon
   Islands and Vanuatu either as nut-in-hell or as kernels. The Canarium
   industry, based on processed kernels, is in its infancy and has huge
   potential to improve the livelihood of the rural poor in these
   countries. We are investigating postharvest processing methods for C.
   indicum that are appropriate to Pacific Island countries. Our research
   is examining depulping, drying, cracking, testa removal, roasting and
   packaging methods. We have found that a 90 s hot water dip removes the
   testa on 85.8% of nuts without loss of whole kernels or increase in
   discolouration. We are also evaluating technology adapted from the
   macadamia industry for processing C. indicum and have found that a
   modified TJ's (TM) nutcracker has potential for efficient cracking of
   nuts. The cracker is portable, hand operated and suitable for use in
   Pacific Island countries for both small scale and commercial processing.
   Further research will examine processing technologies for larger scale
   processing such as mechanical depulpers, dryers and vacuum packaging.

AB In the Western Pacific (Papua New Guinea [PNG], Solomon Islands,
   Indonesian Papua), sweetpotato is the most important staple food crop,
   and production is increasing faster than the population. There has been
   a significant amount of research on sweetpotato in PNG, and the main
   recent publications are highlighted here. In PNG, sweetpotato has become
   more widely grown since 1940, and spatial and production data are
   presented to illustrate that. For example, it contributed 45% of food
   energy from staple food crops in 1961, and had increased to 66% by 2000.
   In Solomon Islands, it accounts for an estimated 65% of the production
   of staple food crops. The main research in PNG over the past 20 years
   has covered cultivar evaluation; description of agricultural systems;
   studies of agronomy and crop physiology; identification of the main pest
   and disease problems; identification of the causes of variation in
   supply of roots over time; description of commercialisation in the
   highlands; impact of its adoption over the past 300 years; and a
   comprehensive electronic bibliography. There have been a number of crop
   science studies on sweetpotato in Papua. The priorities for future
   research on sweetpotato in PNG arising from a 2004 workshop are
   summarised. Cassava is a relatively minor crop in the Western Pacific,
   but it is growing rapidly in importance. Its contribution has increased
   from 2 to 6% of staple food crop production in PNG over the past 40
   years, and accounts for 12% of staple food production in the Solomon
   Islands. The limited research conducted on cassava in PNG has been
   published in a technical paper.

AB Concentrations of butyltin residues were determined in muscle tissue of
   fish collected from local markets and sea food shops in India,
   Bangladesh, Thailand, Indonesia, Vietnam, Taiwan, Australia, Papua New
   Guinea and the Solomon Islands. Contamination levels were determined in
   the Asia-Pacific region and human exposure was estimated. Similarly,
   corresponding liver samples of fish muscle collected in Australia, Papua
   New Guinea and the Solomon Islands were analyzed to obtain information
   on partitioning of butyltin compounds between muscle and liver tissues.
   Butyltin compounds were detected in most of the samples which suggested
   widespread contamination in Asia and Oceania. The concentrations of
   butyltin compounds were, on average, an order of magnitude higher in
   liver than in muscle. Residue concentration of Sigma butyltin in liver
   was found to be correlated significantly (p < 0.02) with those in
   muscle. Intensive ship-scrapping activities, sewage disposal and
   antifouling paints are considered the major sources of butyltins in this
   region. Increased proportions of MBT over DBT and TBT in samples from
   most locations indicated degradation of TBT to MBT in fish tissues
   during storage at 4 degrees C in the dark over 1-2 years. The
   possibility that fish have been subject to increased exposure to MBT and
   that TBT degrades to MBT quite rapidly in tropical environments are also
   considered. Butyltin concentrations in fish from Asia and Oceania were
   lower than those reported for Japan, Canada and the USA. Although the
   number of samples analyzed from each country was small, it is
   tentatively suggested that intake of butyltins by humans via consumption
   of fish in these countries was < 25% of the tolerable daily intake of
   250 ng kg bw(-1) day(-1). To our knowledge, this is the first study
   reporting on butyltin pollution in developing Asian countries.

AB Limited resources are available to address the world's growing

   sites for action. Using new distribution maps for all of the world's
   forest-dependent birds (60.6% of all bird species), we quantify the
   contribution of remaining forest to conserving global avian
   biodiversity. For each of the world's partly or wholly forested 5-km
   cells, we estimated an impact score of its contribution to the
   distribution of all the forest bird species estimated to occur within
   it, and so is proportional to the impact on the conservation status of
   the world's forest-dependent birds were the forest it contains lost. The
   distribution of scores was highly skewed, a very small proportion of
   cells having scores several orders of magnitude above the global mean.
   Ecoregions containing the highest values of this score included
   relatively species-poor islands such as Hawaii and Palau, the relatively
   species-rich islands of Indonesia and the Philippines, and the
   megadiverse Atlantic Forests and northern Andes of South America.
   Ecoregions with high impact scores and high deforestation rates
   (2000-2005) included montane forests in Cameroon and the Eastern Arc of
   Tanzania, although deforestation data were not available for all
   ecoregions. Ecoregions with high impact scores, high rates of recent
   deforestation and low coverage by the protected area network included
   Indonesia's Seram rain forests and the moist forests of Trinidad and

AB Contamination of the marine environment by human-made plastic litter is
   a growing and global problem. Our study attempts to explain the presence
   of two plastic bottles beached on the Ouvea Island, in the southwest
   Pacific Ocean, with trademarks from the Solomon Islands and Papua New
   Guinea (PNG). We simulate the oceanic drift tracks and associated
   transit times with a Lagrangian interpretation of the surface currents
   of a high-resolution ocean model. Our results show that it takes less
   than 2-3 months for drifting objects to connect these archipelagos (New
   Caledonia, Solomon Islands and PNG) and highlight the role of the
   meridional component of the circulation rather than the dominant zonal
   jets. This study shows that the origin or traceability of trash
   represent valuable information that can be used to test and, ultimately,
   improve our understanding of ocean circulation. (C) 2015 The Authors.

AB Four post-nesting hawksbill turtles (Eretmochelys imbricata) in Barbados
   were fitted with satellite transmitters during the 1998 nesting season
   as part of a Caribbean-wide hawksbill research satellite tracking
   project to investigate whether adult females may undertake long-distance
   migrations between their nesting and foraging sites. The four study
   animals left Barbados waters immediately following their final nesting
   activity for the season and travelled for periods of between 7 and 18
   days to reach foraging grounds in Dominica, Grenada, Trinidad, and
   Venezuela, respectively. Straight-line travel distances ranged from 200
   to 435 km. All animals seemed to be influenced by water depth and
   geostrophic currents along their migration routes. The turtles generally
   travelled through shallower waters provided this did not result in
   travel against significant currents. In places where the turtles
   encountered currents moving in the desired direction of travel, their
   travel speeds increased markedly. Foraging home range sizes varied
   between 1.96-49.5 km2 and were positively correlated with the average
   water depth, suggesting that turtles residing in deep water foraging
   areas may have to forage over larger areas to obtain sufficient food
   resources. All turtles settled at locations where sea conditions made
   them relatively inaccessible to fishermen, and this may be a key to
   their survival in countries where turtle fishing is permitted. The data
   indicate that adult females nesting in Barbados, where they are fully
   protected, may spend the majority of their lives in waters where they
   are only partially protected or unprotected.

AB The long-lived radionuclide I-129 (half-life: 15.7 x 10(6) yr) is
   well-known as a useful environmental tracer. At present, the global
   I-129 in surface water is about 1-2 orders of magnitude higher than
   pre-1960 levels. Since the 1990s, anthropogenic I-129 produced from
   industrial nuclear fuels reprocessing plants has been the primary source
   of I-129 in marine surface waters of the Atlantic and around the globe.
   Here we present four coral I-129 time series records from: 1) Con Dao
   and 2) Xisha Islands, the South China Sea, 3) Rabaul, Papua New Guinea
   and 4) Guam. The Con Dao coral I-129 record features a sudden increase
   in I-129 in 1959. The Xisha coral shows similar peak values for I-129 as
   the Con Dao coral, punctuated by distinct low values, likely due to the
   upwelling in the central South China Sea. The Rabaul coral features much
   more gradual I-129 increases in the 1970s, similar to a published record
   from the Solomon Islands. The Guam coral I-129 record contains the
   largest measured values for any site, with two large peaks, in 1955 and
   1959. Nuclear weapons testing was the primary I-129 source in the
   Western Pacific in the latter part of the 20th Century, notably from
   testing in the Marshall Islands. The Guam 1955 peak and Con Dao 1959
   increases are likely from the 1954 Castle Bravo test, and the Operation
   Hardtack I test is the most likely source of the 1959 peak observed at
   Guam. Radiogenic iodine found in coral was carried primarily through
   surface ocean currents. The coral I-129 time series data provide a broad
   picture of the surface distribution and depth penetration of I-129 in
   the Pacific Ocean over the past 60 years. (C) 2016 The Authors.

AB Background Non-communicable diseases (NCD) are now the leading cause of
   death worldwide. As habits and lifestyle are established in childhood
   and adolescence, targeting school children before they develop unhealthy
   habits offers a window of opportunity to halt and reverse the emerging
   NCD epidemic. However, few experiences from school interventions in low-
   and middle-income countries have been collected. Therefore, the aim of
   this study was to review experiences of implementing school-based health
   promotion interventions to identify barriers and recommendations for
   future interventions.
   Methods A qualitative investigation of 17 school-based health promotion
   interventions in low and middle-income countries was conducted. Data
   were collected through questionnaires (15 project leaders) and in-depth
   interviews with nine project leaders. The data from the questionnaires
   and interviews was triangulated and analysed using content analysis,
   where themes and categories emerging from the material were explored.
   Results Three key themes emerged from the data: 1) policy environment
   and stakeholder engagement, 2) health education sessions, and 3)
   practical health promotion activities The themes explored the
   experiences and lessons learned from 17 school-based health promotion
   projects in low- and middle-income countries. Stakeholders at different
   administrative levels were important for the projects; however,
   stakeholders close to implementation were seen to be more engaged. Most
   projects conducted traditional health education lectures, which formed
   the basis of their intervention. Promotion of physical activity and
   healthy eating through participatory approaches were identified;
   however, barriers such as lack of areas suitable for physical activity
   and lack of healthy food alternatives in schools can obstruct the
   successful implementation of interventions.
   Conclusions This study has documented experiences with school-based
   health promotion in low and middle-income countries, and has shown that
   schools can play an important role in facilitating NCD-related
   behavioural change in children. The study recommends increased emphasis
   on a whole-school approach where activities focusing on individual
   behavioural change are supported by interventions improving the
   structural environment.

   were found in the islands to the north of Papua New Guinea but not in
   Australia and 1 sp. restricted to the Coral sea was previously reported
   only from northeast Australia [Teredo poculifer]. There was a
   significant difference in the species composition in estuarine brackish
   waters compared with that in coastal marine waters. The teredinids may
   be put into 4 categories according to their occurrence in waters of
   different salinities: stenohaline marine species, euryhaline marine
   species, brackish water species and euryhaline brackish water species or

AB Canned fish is a healthy alternative to the poor-quality, imported,
   processed foods implicated in the rise of non-communicable diseases in
   Pacific Island countries. Increased availability and consumption of
   canned fish also promises to help fill the gap between sustainable
   coastal fish production and recommended intake of fish for good
   nutrition. This study estimates the recent contribution of canned
   products to fish supply in Fiji, Papua New Guinea (PNG) and Solomon
   Islands, based on the quantities of imported and locally-produced canned
   fish sold on domestic markets. The greatest quantities of canned fish
   were sold in PNG, however, average annual consumption of canned fish per
   capita was highest in Fiji (8.8 +/- 1.3 kg) and Solomon Islands (5.9 +/-
   0.6 kg), where it supplied an average of 25 +/- 4% and 17 +/- 2% of
   recommended dietary fish intake, respectively. Canned tuna comprised an
   average of 53 +/- 2% of the canned fish consumption in Fiji and 92 +/-
   1% in Solomon Islands. Key actions needed to maintain/increase per
   capita consumption of canned fish in Pacific Island countries include
   promoting the health benefits of canned tuna to help combat
   non-communicable diseases, and facilitating distribution of
   locally-canned products, especially to the inland population of PNG.
   Increasing the market share of locally-canned tuna by assisting national
   canneries to obtain sufficient supplies of tuna to achieve economies of
   scale and compete effectively in both domestic and infra-regional canned
   fish trade, could create more employment and contribute indirectly to
   local food security.

AB Since the 1970s, macroalgae have become considerably more abundant on
   many Caribbean reefs and overfishing of grazing fishes has been
   implicated as a contributory factor. We explored relationships between
   algal cover and grazers (biomass of herbivorous fishes and abundance of
   the sea-urchin Diadema antillarum) on mid-depth reefs (12-15 m) in 19
   areas at seven locations in Jamaica, Barbados, Belize, Grand Cayman and
   Cuba, between April 1997 and April 1998. Diadema antillarum density was
   never > 0.01 m(-2), while herbivorous fish biomass (acanthurids and
   scarids greater than or equal to 12 cm total length) varied from 2-5 g
   m(-2) in Jamaica to 17.1 g m(-2) in Barbados. and was strongly
   correlated. negatively with macroalgal cover and positively with
   'cropped' sub-stratum (sum of 'bare', turf and crustose-coralline
   substrata) cover. However. overfishing of herbivorous fishes alone
   cannot explain the widespread abundance of macroalgae. as even on
   lightly fished reefs, macroalgal cover was mostly > 20%. Herbivorous
   fish populations on those reefs were apparently only able to maintain
   approximately 40-60% of reef substratum in cropped states, but due to
   low space-occupation by coral and other invertebrates. 70-90% of
   substratum was available to algae. The abundance of macroalgae on
   lightly fished reefs may therefore be a symptom of low coral cover in
   combination with the continuing absence of Diadema antillarum.

AB The energy situation of the African island states which include Cape
   Verde, Sao Tome and Principe, Comoros, Guinea-Bissau, Madagascar,
   Mauritius and Seychelles are overwhelmingly dependent on fossil fuels
   with paradoxically high potential of renewable energy which are sparsely
   developed. This paper lay emphasis on the present electricity situation
   in these countries and highlights the potential of renewable energy
   resources on their territories. Among Africa islands, demographic and
   economic features are dissimilar and their power sector is complex by
   unique challenges. It is seen that there is a critical lack of
   electricity in Guinea-Bissau and Madagascar, which are 21% and 13%
   respectively, due to political instability and high spending on diesel.
   Moreover, the electricity consumption per capita is alarming in
   Guinea-Bissau, Comoros and Madagascar where it is below the average
   consumption for low income countries.
   Sustainable energy supply can be achieved by renewable energy sources,
   however, not all renewable resources are technically and economically
   feasible for development in these countries, for example wind in Comoros
   and hydro in Mauritius have little potential - which this paper
   elaborated further. Based on these analysis, a roadmap was developed, on
   to how to address some of the energy issues in these countries and
   accelerate the uptake of renewable energy. Through energy governance
   reform, political decision makers can drive change within their
   government, especially when a reform entails opening market
   opportunities and stimulating private participation and exerting
   pressure on existing government agencies to work efficiently.

AB Most Pacific Island countries and territories (PICTs) have developing
   economies and face a critical shortage of veterinarians with limited
   financial resources allocated to their animal disease surveillance
   programmes. Thus, animal health authorities have to set priorities for
   better focusing their scarce resources. The main objective of this study
   was to identify animal diseases perceived to be of importance by
   decision makers within selected PICTs, at the regional and national
   levels, to ensure better targeting of animal health resources. A second
   objective was to investigate whether the targeted surveillance
   programmes resulting from this rationalized approach would also benefit
   the local communities engaged in livestock production. A multi-criteria
   prioritization process was developed, involving local experts, to score
   and rank 132 animal diseases based on their priority at the regional and
   national levels for four PICTs: Fiji, Papua New Guinea, Solomon Islands,
   and Vanuatu, which form part of a regional Food Animal Biosecurity
   Network. In parallel interviews with farmers and field animal health and
   production workers were conducted to assess their perception of animal
   diseases. The list of the top-twenty ranked diseases for the Pacific
   Islands region shows a mix of endemic zoonotic diseases (such as
   leptospirosis ranked first; brucellosis third; tuberculosis sixth; and
   endoparasites and ectoparasites, respectively eleventh and thirteenth)
   with exotic diseases (such as HPAI ranked second, FMD fifth, and rabies
   ninth). There were different disease ranking lists for each of the four
   targeted PICTs, confirming different strategies of disease prevention
   and control may be required for each country, rather than a regional
   approach. Interviewed animal health and production workers were
   unfamiliar with most of the prioritized diseases and a majority
   acknowledged that they would not be able to recognize clinical signs if
   outbreaks were to occur in their area. Leptospirosis, which is endemic
   and identified as the top priority disease at the regional level, was
   never mentioned by any interviewed farmer. Farmers did not name any
   emerging infectious diseases as priorities. Instead, they identified
   endemic diseases (parasites, flu, coccidiosis, and scabies) as the most
   important. While animal disease priorities appear to differ widely
   between the targeted regions and countries, it also varies significantly
   between experts and farmers. Better targeted surveillance programmes may
   thus result in more rational and transparent allocation of resources,
   and thus enhanced food security, but may not directly match the needs of
   the local communities. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The tectonic mechanisms controlling how volcanic arcs migrate through
   space and geologic time within dynamic subduction environments is a
   fundamental tectonic process that remains poorly understood. This paper
   presents an integrated stratigraphic and tectonic evolution of Late
   Cretaceous to Recent volcanic arcs and associated basins in the
   southeastern Caribbean Sea using seismic reflection data, wide-angle
   seismic refraction data, well data, and onland geologic data. We propose
   a new tectonic model for the opening of the Grenada and Tobago basins
   and the 50-250-km eastward jump of arc volcanism from the Late
   Cretaceous Ayes Ridge to the Miocene to Recent Lesser Antilles arc in
   the southeast Caribbean based on the mapping of three seismic
   megasequences. The striking similarity of the half-graben structure of
   the Grenada and Tobago basins that flank the Lesser Antilles arc, their
   similar smooth basement character, their similar deep-marine seismic
   facies, and their similar Paleogene sediment thickness mapped on a
   regional grid of seismic data suggest that the two basins formed as a
   single, saucer-shaped, oceanic crust Paleogene forearc basin adjacent to
   the now dormant Ayes Ridge. This single forearc basin continued to
   extend and widen through flexural subsidence during the early to middle
   Eocene probably because of slow rollback of the subducting Atlantic
   oceanic slab. Rollback may have been accelerated by oblique collision of
   the southern Ayes Ridge and southern Lesser Antilles arc with the South
   American continent. Uplift and growth of the southern Lesser Antilles
   arc divided the Grenada and Tobago basins by early to middle Miocene
   time. Inversion of normal faults and uplift effects along both edges of
   the Lesser Antilles arc are most pronounced in its southern zone of arc
   collision with the South American continent. The late Miocene to Recent
   depositional histories of the Grenada and Tobago basins are distinct
   because of isolation of the Grenada basin by growth and uplift of the
   Neogene Lesser Antilles volcanic ridge. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All

   monospilus, previously misidentified as A. moluccensis, is described as
   a new species. It is distinguished from A. moluccensis by having 25-28
   gill rakers plus rudiments and darkly pigmented roof of mouth including
   some of the gill arches versus 21-25 gill rakers with pale roof of mouth
   and gill arches. The new species was frequently collected in depths

AB The Caribbean region is endowed with renewable energy resources which
   remain largely untapped. With an average insolation of 15-20 MJ m(-2)
   day(-1), investment in some renewable energy technologies is feasible.
   The major problem confronting the region is lack of financial resources.
   Petroleum imports continue to dominate the energy scenario except for
   Trinidad and Tobago and Barbados. However, increased awareness of
   sustainable development issues throughout the region is a major factor
   in support of renewable energy implementation and is a driving force for
   energy policy decision-making. With the necessary joint-venture
   partnerships and government fiscal incentives, photovoltaic
   technologies, wind energy and solar energy industries are poised to
   expand thus reducing the dependency on fossil fuel imports while
   preserving the environment. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights

AB The sponge genus Strongylodesma is reviewed and redefined, and now
   accommodates eight closely related species. The type species of
   Strongylodesma Levi is redescribed and an additional two new species are
   described from the Indo-Pacific: S. novaecaledoniae sp. nov. and S.
   tongaensis sp. nov. Several specimens previously identified as species
   of Batzella (Poecilosclerida: Chondropsidae) have been re-assigned to
   Strongylodesma, as the new species S. purpureus sp. nov. and S. nigra.
   sp. nov. With the description here of new species from the Pacific Ocean
   and Caribbean Atlantic, the biogeographical distribution Of
   Strongylodesma now appears to be generally tropical with a subtropical
   South African component, whereas previously it was only known from South
   Africa. Although species of Strongylodesma have not previously been
   recorded from the intermediate locations (Western Indian Ocean,
   South-east Asia, central west Pacific, and New Zealand), re-evaluation
   here will facilitate more readily the recognition of taxa in these
   intermediate regions, if they exist, in the future. The species are not
   widespread, except perhaps along the south-east coast of South Africa,
   and where they occur they are not abundant. Species occur over a wide
   depth range, from the intertidal in Tsitsikamma, South Africa, to 140 In
   in the Caribbean.

AB Ophiothela mirabilis is native to the Pacific Ocean and has recently
   invaded the Caribbean and the southwestern Atlantic. In this study,
   using SCUBA diving techniques, we observed specimens of the invasive O.
   mirabilis in association with an octocoral host (Leptogorgia punicea) at
   the equatorial margin in the southwestern Atlantic (03 degrees 32'S, 38
   degrees 47'W). We filled a gap of more than similar to 1,500 km between
   the Amazon reefs and the coast of Pernambuco State. The results indicate
   that O. mirabilis has invaded similar to 6,700 km of coastline in the
   southwestern Atlantic in the last 17 years. Moreover, our results
   support the hypothesis that the consistent color pattern of specimens
   from Brazil, French Guiana, Saint Vincent, and Tobago indicates the
   existence of a single lineage proliferating by asexual reproduction.
   Because the South Atlantic is the most recent of the oceans, as well as
   a hotspot for tropical biodiversity, much more information on
   invertebrate bioinvasions in this region is needed.

AB Acerola is a cherry-like tropical fruit that is very popular in Central
   America, the Caribbean countries (especially in Barbados, Trinidad and
   Tobago, and Haiti), and Brazil. This fruit, which has a red color at
   complete maturity, is valued mostly for its vitamin C content. Recent
   research showed that in addition to vitamin C, acerola fruit may be a
   good source of phytochemicals such as anthocyanins, nonanthocyanin
   phenolic compounds, and dietary carotenoids. Because these compounds are
   known as bioactive due to their strong antioxidant capacity, acerola
   fruit is attracting the attention of food researchers and the exotic
   fruit market. One of the problems faced by acerola growers and
   processors is that acerola fruit is highly perishable at complete
   maturity, resulting in serious quality losses during and after harvest.
   Therefore, the harvest and the postharvest handling are very important
   to obtain fruits with acceptable quality. The first part of this review
   is a complete analysis of the available information on the production
   and the postharvest handling of acerola fruit. In the second part of
   this paper, information regarding the chemistry, nutrition, and
   potential biological activity of acerola fruit is reviewed and put into
   perspective.

AB Intensive sampling of molluscs from the intertidal to depths of 800 m
   around the islands of Guadeloupe in the Lesser Antilles (KARUBENTHOS
   2012, 2015) recovered 25 species of Lucinidae. All the Guadeloupe
   species are described and illustrated including details of larval shells
   and the taxonomy revised within the context of the wider western
   Atlantic fauna and recent classifications. Concurrent molecular analysis
   has helped separate frequently confounded species. 'Myrtea' pristiphora
   is placed in the Leucosphaerine genus Myrtina previously known from the
   Indo-West Pacific. A second western Atlantic species of Callucina, C.
   pauperatus previously known from the Pliocene of Jamaica is recognised
   from the southern Caribbean and off Brazil. The deeper water species
   'Myrteopis' lens is placed in Afrolucina previously known from the
   eastern Atlantic. Lucinids commonly identified as Ctena orbiculata are
   shown to belong to two distinct species, C. orbiculata in the Gulf of
   Mexico and Florida and C. imbricatula in the Caribbean. Epicodakia is
   recognised for the first time in the western Atlantic with E. pectinata
   widely distributed across the region and E. filiata recorded from deeper
   water. Three species of Lucina are recognised, Lucina pensylvanica in
   the Gulf of Mexico and Florida and the similar Lucina roquesana from the
   Caribbean and Bahamas while the smaller L. aurantia has a wide
   distribution from central America to the Bahamas. A new species of
   Parvilucina, P. latens is described; this is similar to P. pectinella
   but has an internal ligament. The long problematic species 'Codakia'
   cubana is assigned to Ferrocina. A new genus, Guyanella is introduced
   for Parvilucina clenchi the smallest known lucinid. A critical
   reassessment of the lucinid fauna of the western Atlantic Ocean
   identifies 46 species for the region with 33 of these living at depths
   less than 200 m. Deeper-water habitats have been much less investigated
   except at sites of hydrocarbon seeps. Some species are widespread
   throught the whole region but others have more restricted ranges.
   Notable are species pairs, for example of Ctena, Lucina, Lucinisca and
   Parvilucina that are either largely Caribbean or Gulf of
   Mexico/Floridian in distribution. Although extralimital, two problematic
   species from the mid-south Atlantic island of St Helena are refigured
   and placed in Cavilinga.

AB The island of Barbuda has a relatively unique history, land tenure and

   to large-scale agriculture due to its arid climate and relatively thin
   soils. Instead, the enslaved and eventually free people of Barbuda
   developed a complex herding ecology centered on common land ownership.
   As a result, carefully designed historic wells are strategically located
   around the island. With the challenges brought about by climate change,
   an interdisciplinary, international team led by the Barbuda Research
   Complex is investigating the state of existing water and food resources
   and examining how the availability and quality of water resources have
   influenced local cultural practices. Barbudans and international

AB A review of the literature and examination of over 3,200 specimens of
   shallow water (<200 m) tropical western Atlantic (TWA) Drilliidae Olson,
   1964 in museum and private collections has resulted in the recognition
   of numerous previously undescribed species, 100 of which are proposed
   here for the first time. A total of 65 names were found in the
   literature. Of these, 48 are considered valid, 16 synonyms, and one
   nomen dubium. In addition, characteristics that distinguish each genus
   currently in use for TWA shallow water species have indicated the need
   for reassignment (new combinations within Drilliidae) of 15 species.
   Some nomenclatural actions have come about from the literature review
   and include one taxon placed in junior synonymy (under an older name
   recently re-discovered) and one new name for a junior homonym. Two
   neotypes, five lectotype designations, and one new name are also
   proposed. Altogether, nomenclatural actions on 17% of valid previously
   described taxa are proposed. The 100 proposed names are placed in 12
   available and one new genus: Agladrillia Woodring, 1928 (2), Bellaspira
   Conrad, 1868 (7), Calliclava McLean, 1971 (3), Cerodrillia Bartsch &
   Rehder, 1939 (11), Clathrodrillia Dall, 1918 (6), Decoradrillia, new
   genus (4), Douglassia Bartsch, 1934 (4), Fenimorea Bartsch, 1934 (15),
   Leptadrillia Woodring, 1928 (12), Lissodrillia Bartsch & Rehder, 1939
   (8), Neodrillia Bartsch, 1943 (2), Splendrillia Hedley, 1922 (13), and
   Syntomodrillia Woodring, 1928 (13). These are the first reports of
   Calliclava in the western Atlantic, previously known only from the
   eastern Pacific. The new genus, Decoradrillia, is proposed to hold four
   new species and one existing that share a unique shell microsculpture
   and other morphological traits. One genus, Drillia Gray, 1838, is not
   currently believed to have TWA representatives. Three genera comprised
   exclusively of bathyal species are not treated in this work: Clavus
   Monfort, 1810 (=Eldridgea Bartsch, 1934), Globidrillia Woodring, 1928,
   and Spirotropis Sars, 1878. The significant increase in species within
   all of the genera has the effect of strengthening the groups' diagnostic
   characters by their presence across a greater number of species. Each of
   the 148 valid species treated herein are described (or redescribed) and
   photographs of types presented, as are photographs of morphological
   variants and representatives from separate geographic areas, if
   available, to illustrate species' variability.

AB Small Pacific islands, especially atolls, have been widely argued to be
   in the forefront of climate change. Recent degradation of island
   environments has primarily been attributed to the impact of sea-level
   rise. However, physical changes to several small islands can be linked
   to a range of physical influences and to human modification. La Nifia
   events, cyclones, and wind waves have caused localized flooding and
   storm damage. Most atoll islands have not significantly changed in size,
   as deposition balances erosion. Many islands have experienced broadly
   similar environmental problems in earlier times, at different scales,
   and over different time periods, now accentuated by human pressures on
   scarce land areas and resources. Local human factors (including
   construction and mining), tectonic subsidence, and La Nifia events have
   created some iconic sites that have become symbols of sea-level rise,
   sometimes erroneously attributed solely to global warming. Limited
   economic prospects in most small islands, rising expectations, and
   growing populations have contributed to a culture of migration, marked
   by international migration and urbanization, that has diversified
   impoverished livelihoods, extended island geographies, and resulted in
   accentuated population concentrations. Contemporary climate change
   exacerbates present environmental changes, stimulates further migration,
   and points to diasporic futures.

AB The extensive fossil record of coiled nautiloids indicates that they
   comprised a diverse assemblage of species in ancient oceans. Today they
   are represented by the genera Nautilus Linnaeus, 1758 and Allonautilus
   Ward and Saunders, 1997, inhabiting reef systems throughout the
   Judo-Pacific region. Some individual populations of Nautilus show subtle
   differences in shell morphologies, and these morphological differences
   may be used to diagnose different species. An alternative view is that
   these differences are simply geographically localized, morphological
   variants within the broadly distributed taxon generally referred to as
   Nautilus pompilius Linnaeus, 1758. Here we present a hypothesis for the
   phylogeny of present-day Nautilus and Allonautilus using molecular
   characters from two mitochondrial gene regions, 16S rDNA and Cytochrome
   Oxidase c subunit T. Populations of N. pompilius in Indonesia (Ambon
   Strait), the Philippines, Vanuatu (New Hebrides Islands), Papua New
   Guinea, Carter Reef and Osprey Reef (Great Barrier Reef, Queensland,
   Australia) and N. macromphalus (Sowerby, 1849) in New Caledonia were
   surveyed as well as samples of N. repertus (Sowerby, 1849) (Rowley
   Shoals, Western Australia), N. belauensis (Saunders, 1981) (Palau), and
   N. stenomphalus (Sowerby, 1849) (Queensland, Australia). The gastropod
   Crepidula striolata (Menke, 1851) was included as an outgroup. Our
   results indicate that Nautilus is currently undergoing a period of
   evolutionary radiation throughout the Indo-Pacific region. The topology
   of the strict consensus tree suggests that the basal divergence between
   Nautilus and Allonautilus occurred in the waters surrounding the
   present-day island of New Guinea and the northern part of the Great
   Barrier Reef in northeast Australia. This was followed by a migration to
   the east by the common ancestor of N. macromphalus and the N. pompilius
   populations in Vanuatu, Fiji, and American Samoa. A subsequent migration
   to the west led to the founding of populations off the west coast of
   Australia, the Philippines, Palau, and Indonesia. Our results also
   indicate that N. macromphalus and A. scrobiculatus are phylogenetic
   species. However, N. pompilius is a paraphyletic assemblage of
   populations and does not represent a true phylogenetic species.
   Divergences within the genus Nautilus appear to be driven by geographic
   isolation, and we discuss how this may be a result of constraints on
   dispersal imposed by the ecology of the animals.

AB A semi-systematic literature review of national policies was carried out
   in relation to surveillance and disease reporting in Pacific Island
   Countries and Territories (PICTs). It also analysed the animal disease
   reporting structures in Fiji, Papua New Guinea (PNG), Vanuatu and the
   Solomon Islands. The strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats
   (SWOT) of those reporting structures were examined in relation to how
   they impacted the detection and management of animal diseases in PICTs.
   Field missions collected information on animal disease reporting
   structures and these were discussed in detail with country officials and
   documented. The findings from the literature review indicated that there
   is very little policy to support work in surveillance and disease
   reporting within national government structures of the countries
   studied. This increases the potential for disease transmission and the
   introduction of exotic diseases as the efficiency of disease reporting
   is low. The findings from the SWOT analysis of the reporting structures
   indicated that there were commonalities across the countries studied,
   i.e. reporting structures were long with multiple legs that were not
   functioning properly and this was worsened when positions were vacant in
   the reporting structure. The hierarchical nature of the reporting
   structure also reduced reporting efficiency as reports took a longer
   time to reach decision makers at the top of the structure. High officer
   turnover and the shortage of veterinarians in the countries studied also
   affected the efficiency of disease reporting as most in-county officials
   were inexperienced and could not recognise disease signs and there were
   no veterinarians to supervise them. Existing reporting structures need
   to be reviewed to remove duplication and shorten the chain. However,
   this could override existing command structures and would need to be
   documented and awareness created with the officers involved. There also
   needs to be more collaboration with FAO, OIE, academic institutions and
   national governments to create an environment conducive for the
   development of policies that support work on surveillance to improve
   disease reporting in PICTs. The shortage of veterinarians could be
   addressed by influencing national governments to create better policies
   to retain veterinarians in the animal health services; this should be
   supported by creating reasonable work conditions and remuneration
   packages. This should also be supported with policies to send young
   graduates to study veterinary science overseas and have a career path
   for them when they return. Engagement of retired veterinarians from
   developed countries and re-evaluating the criteria for veterinarian
   registration could be short-term solutions to address the shortage of
   veterinarians in PICTs.

   with primers for the env were used for phylogenetic analysis of BLV in
   positive animals. We found FRET-PCR positive cattle (12.6%, 41/325) on
   Dominica (5.2%; 4/77) and St. Kitts (19.2%; 37/193) but not on
   Montserrat (0%, 0/12) or Nevis (0%, 0/43). Positive animals were cows on
   farms where animals were raised intensively. Phylogenetic analysis using
   the neighbor-joining (NJ) method on partial and full-length env
   sequences obtained for strains from Dominica (n = 2) and St. Kitts (n =
   5) and those available in GenBank (n = 90) (genotypes 1-10) revealed the
   Caribbean strains belonged to genotype 1 (98-100% sequence homology).
   Ours is the first molecular characterization of BLV infections in the
   Caribbean and the first description of genotype 1 in the region.

AB Growing flowers for commercial purpose in many South Pacific countries
   is a relatively new enterprise. Floricultural growers are typically
   village-based micro businesses. Moreover, many commercial florists
   operate from home. These enterprises are mostly operated by women. Their
   structure is indicative of the entrepreneurship of indigenous and
   expatriate women. The number of growers and florist industry
   participants is steadily growing in association with expansion in other
   industries, including tourism and infrastructure development. This paper
   focuses on non-corporate floricultural value chains in Fiji, Solomon
   Islands (SI) and Papua New Guinea (PNG). Qualitative research was
   conducted from 2010 to 2013 in each of these countries. It included
   focus group discussions with growers, florists and consumers, and
   in-depth interviews with stakeholders. The floricultural value chains
   across the three countries share similar business culture and
   constraints. Nonetheless, differences in certain dimensions merit
   characterisation and contrasting. Strategic considerations for different
   types of value chains are outlined depending on their comparative
   advantages. The findings suggest that each value chain should employ one
   or a mix of three strategies for comparative market advantage. These
   strategies involve offering: i) unique or differentiated products, ii)
   competitive prices through operational efficiency, and iii) good
   services through relationship building with niche market segments. All
   sound businesses should consider a plan offering several strategies.
   However, and importantly, a main strategy should be identified before
   planning the introduction of other beneficial commercial strategies.

AB Habitat loss and more recently, climate change are primary challenges to
   the effectiveness of protected area networks (PANs) in species
   conservation within many archipelagic biodiversity hotspots across the
   globe. An environmental niche model (ENM) of 11 high-conservation-value
   tree species was used to assess the effectiveness of the PAN within the
   Caribbean island of Trinidad under future (2050s) climate conditions.
   Overlay analyses were conducted inside and outside of existing PANs to
   determine the proportions of natural and plantation (monoculture)
   forests. Proportions of this species group's climate space projected to
   be critical for conservation (combination of stable and expanding zones
   or 'Z4') that are under forest cover were also calculated. Approximately
   63% of Trinidad is forested, with the majority of plantation forests
   located within the PAN, producing noticeable areas of cleared forest
   when harvested. The ENM projected a drastic reduction in climate space
   for this group of high-conservation-value tree species across the
   island. However, approximately 54% of the Z4 space was projected to
   occur within the PAN; and 61% of the Z4 falling outside the PAN was
   under forest cover. Consequently, conservation of this species group
   could be greatly enhanced by increasing the proportion of its Z4 climate
   space outside the PAN under maintained forest/secondary vegetation
   cover. Given the small size of small island states (SIS) (such as those
   in the Caribbean) relative to the macro-scale of climate change, a more
   effective means of managing climate-induced species loss could involve
   the development of regional-scale PANs rather than separate efforts of
   individual SIS.

AB A list of all known polychaete species reported in the primary

   polychaete faunas are those of Cuba in the North Caribbean ecoregion and
   Trinidad-Tobago and Colombia in the South Caribbean ecoregion while the
   ecoregion with the greatest number of species is the Greater Antilles.
   While part of the explanation for these higher diversity areas may be
   due to collection effort, these areas may also be higher in species
   number as a result of being ecotones between the Gulf of Mexico in the
   north and the northern South American region to the south. The most
   species-rich families are the Syllidae, Eunicidae, Nereididae,
   Polynoidae, Sabellidae, Serpulidae, Terebellidae, and Spionidae. A brief
   discussion of the history of polychaete research identified many of the
   more important workers in the characterization of the polychaete fauna
   of the region. An analysis of the species-record accumulation curve for
   polychaetes indicated that this fauna has not yet been fully
   characterized. One portion of the polychaete fauna identified as being
   especially poorly known is that from the deep-water areas of the
   Caribbean.

   linked to their historic, geographic and socio-economic characteristics.
   Small populations and limited energy demand cap the penetration of

   for electricity storage, grid services, reduced fuel imports, and
   reduced pollution with associated health benefits. This paper provides a
   comprehensive review of literature on island applications of electric

AB Invasive species often have dramatic negative effects that lead to the
   deterioration and loss of biodiversity frequently coupled with the
   burden of expensive biocontrol programs and subversion of socioeconomic
   stability. The fauna and flora of oceanic islands are particularly
   susceptible to invasive species and the increase of global movements of
   humans and their products since WW II has caused numerous anthropogenic
   translocations and increased the ills of human-mediated invasions. We
   use a multi-locus genomic dataset to identify geographic origin, pace,
   pattern and historical process of an invasive scincid lizard (Carlia)
   that has been inadvertently introduced to Guam, the Northern Marianas,
   and Palau. This lizard is of major importance as its introduction is
   thought to have assisted in the establishment of the invasive brown
   treesnake (Boiga irregularis) on Guam by providing a food resource. Our
   findings demonstrate multiple waves of introductions that appear to be
   concordant with movements of Allied and Imperial Japanese forces in the
   Pacific during World War II.

AB Pentad satellite-based precipitation estimates were input into a wavelet
   analysis to quantify the length, timing, and strength of the mid-summer
   drought (MSD) for the Caribbean Sea and surrounding regions. For most of
   the Caribbean the time between the first and second summer precipitation
   maxima is 98 to 117 days (similar to 3 to 4 months). The MSD appears in
   early-June over Puerto Rico and Hispaniola, and develops progressively
   later in the summer season towards the west, finally occurring in
   early-October over the Gulf of Mexico. The MSD is most intense in the
   eastern Pacific, strong and significant in the western Caribbean, and
   almost nonexistent in the eastern Caribbean. Forcing mechanisms are
   examined to help explain the regional variability in the Caribbean. A
   July increase in surface pressure and surface divergence, caused by the
   changing wind field, appears to contribute to a strong concurrent MSD
   over the waters bounded by Jamaica, Cuba, and the Yucatan peninsula.
   Finally, the island of Jamaica itself appears to block the flow of the
   tradewinds as they migrate northward and intensify into mid-summer, thus
   enhancing the divergence, and in turn MSD, immediately to the west.

AB Coral reefs in the South Western Pacific Island nations are under
   increasing pressure from rapidly rising human populations, urbanization,
   and agricultural and industrial development. Little is documented on the
   characteristics and status of reefs in the region; in this study the
   status of reefs in the Fiji, Tonga and Western Samoa groups are assessed
   mainly from unpublished sources. The scale of human impacts in each
   group ranges from minimal in outer islands and reefs, to intense in
   urban areas. Western Samoa, which has a relatively small area of reef, a
   large subsistence population and few economic resources is most
   affected; Tonga with a larger number of reefs is moderately affected;
   Fiji, with a large number of reefs and a broad-based economy is least
   affected, Rapid population growth and unplanned development in urban
   areas and capital islands have resulted in a significant loss of coastal
   habitats, overfishing, pollution and eutrophication of adjacent lagoons
   and reefs, particularly in leeward reefs with limited ocean exchange
   (such as in Fanga'uta lagoon in Tonga, and north west Upolu in Western
   Samoa). Water quality remains pristine in rural areas but on high, wet
   islands erosion resulting from changing land use has caused
   sedimentation and eutrophication of inshore reefs. Outbreaks of
   crown-of-thorns starfish, possibly exacerbated by human disturbances,
   have caused some damage to reefs in Tonga, moderate damage in Fiji, and
   widespread damage in Western Samoa. Growth and stock overfishing have
   occurred in many inshore fish species, particularly the vulnerable rock
   cods and mullet. Turtles, coconut crabs and giant clams (long-lived,
   slow growing species) are endangered in most of the region; species are
   locally extinct in some areas, Management of the marine environment is
   very limited in the region and environmental awareness, technical and
   financial resources are lacking.

AB Urban planners in the Caribbean have long advocated for a resolution of
   conflicts between built development and the environment. They have
   grappled with challenges of small geographic size, an increasingly
   urbanised landscape and the need to facilitate urban centres as engines
   of economic development and as the loci of prosperity. This article
   investigates the urban planning community's perspective with respect to
   the drivers of unsustainable urbanisation and provides a conceptual
   framework for urban planning to attain urban sustainability in a small
   island developing state context. Trinidad is used as a case study. The
   research found that urbanisation has been inadequately regulated despite
   a plethora of legislation, urban plans and policies, and that the
   political will to achieve urban sustainability is lacking. This has
   resulted in ecosystem damage, economic losses and the undermining of
   human well-being. The article concludes that urban planning needs a
   conceptual framework to move centre stage and a steadfast political will
   is paramount in achieving urban sustainability in the Caribbean.

   results suggested that even if a society had been integrated into the

   which was fertile, mainly for traditional shifting cultivation under
   customary management. However, they used a large area of the main island
   for cultivation of potentially risky perennial cash crops for private

   contact with urine from infected animals, either directly or through
   urine-contaminated surface water. In this study, we screened
   environmental water on the island of St. Kitts by using a TaqMan based
   real time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) targeting a
   pathogen specific leptospiral gene, lipl32. Our results indicate that
   around one-fifth of tested water sources have detectable leptospiral

AB Objective. To quantify the prevalence of obesity and obesity-related
   factors in a cross-sectional, observational study of Caribbean students
   using the results of three recent surveys of health behavior among
   undergraduates in Barbados, Grenada, and Jamaica.
   Methods. A total of 1 578 Caribbean undergraduate students from
   Barbados, Grenada, and Jamaica (ages 18-30 years) completed
   questionnaires and had physical measurements recorded. Multivariable
   logistic regression was used to estimate odds ratios (ORs) for the
   association of nutrition behaviors with prevalence of obesity (body mass
   index >= 30 kg/m(2)); elevated waist-to-height ratio (W/ht) (> 0.50);
   and high waist circumference (WC) (> 88 cm in females, > 102 cm in
   males). Models were adjusted for age, year in university, socioeconomic
   status, and sex.
   Results. There was a higher prevalence of obesity (13% versus 10%), high
   WC (21% versus 7%), and high W/ht (35% versus 25%) in females relative
   to males. Compared to females, males had reduced odds of obesity (OR
   0.46), high WC (OR 0.22), and high W/ht (OR 0.61) (P < 0.05 for all).
   Both females (46%) and males (24%) reported high levels of physical
   inactivity. Fruit and vegetable consumption was low (approximately two
   servings per day). Many students reported avoiding fatty foods (40%);
   this behavior was associated with high W/ht (OR 1.68), obesity (OR
   1.90), and high WC (OR 1.82) (P < 0.05 for all). Irregular breakfast
   consumption, age, and year of study were also positively associated with
   obesity. Physical activity was not significantly associated with any
   obesity measure.
   Conclusions. There was a low prevalence of healthy behaviors and a high
   prevalence of obesity in this sample of Caribbean young adults.

AB Small Island Developing States (SIDS) in the Caribbean and Pacific have
   gone from a place of self-sufficiency and energy independence, during
   pre-colonial times, to a position, in more recent times, of being (often
   heavily) dependent on both imported capital (loans and aid) and imported
   sources of energy. This paper asserts that the current dependence of
   Caribbean and Pacific SIDS on both development assistance from donor
   agencies and imported fossil fuels is not coincidental, but rather, it
   was due to the transition of these islands from subsistence agriculture
   to export-oriented economies, primarily to serve the interests of more
   developed metropolitan countries. These interests have included the
   provision of cheap raw materials and agricultural produce to imperial
   nations; which has meant that SIDS needed to develop export orientated
   economies requiting both financial capital and energy supply usually
   over and above that available locally.
   The impact of colonisation on domestic energy use and demand in SIDS is
   thus briefly outlined so as to make clear how these nations transitioned
   from self-sufficiency to dependence on foreign capital and energy. It is
   upon this backdrop that the current dependence of SIDS on international
   aid, particularly with regards to the energy sector, has been analysed,
   along with its influence on energy policy in SIDS.
   This paper suggests that while imported finance and energy have been
   crucial to the past development of SIDS, the extent of reliance upon
   external financial assistance and energy imports at present is a cause
   for concern not only due to long term energy security issues but also
   because of the climate change implications of fossil fuel use. The
   concern is also pressing within the context of long term debt
   accumulation. It is argued herein that closer attention should be paid
   to local capacity building, training and institutional strengthening to
   enable a transition to renewable energy in place of fossil fuel based
   power. In terms of long term resilience such capacity building could
   eventually include the means for the production of renewable energy
   technology components. (C) 2013 International Energy Initiative.

AB Shallow-water limestones of presumed Late Cretaceous and Eocene age,
   interbedded with basaltic lavas, were described by earlier authors from
   Sao Nicolau in the northwestern part of the Cabo Verde archipelago. If
   confirmed, these ages would imply late Mesozoic shallow-marine and
   subaerial volcanic activity in the Cabo Verde archipelago, and document
   a geological history very different from that known so far from other
   Cabo Verde Islands, from which no subaerial volcanic activity before the
   mid-Cenozoic is known. Our re-investigation of the foraminiferal fauna
   indicates a Late Miocene age for the presumed Late Cretaceous and Eocene
   limestones. The hypothesis of a long-lived hot spot, active by the Early
   Cretaceous, and of a major island-building stage in the Cabo Verde
   Islands during this period, is therefore not supported by the present
   bio- or chronostratigraphic data.

AB Leptospirosis is a zoonotic disease of global importance. Very little
   information is available on Leptospira infection in nonhuman primates.
   We report herein a high seroprevalence (49.4%; 95% confidence interval:
   41.6-57.2%) to Leptospira serovars in vervet monkeys (Chlorocebus
   sabeus) on the Caribbean island of Saint Kitts. Monkeys bred in
   captivity (n = 81) had a significantly higher seroprevalence compared to
   wild-caught monkeys (n = 81; p < 0.05). Seroprevalence to serovar
   Bataviae was significantly higher in monkeys bred in captivity and was
   higher to serovar Bratislava in wild-caught monkeys (p < 0.05). Our data
   confirm that exposure to various Leptospira serovars and seroconversion
   occurs in wild and captive vervet monkeys on the Caribbean island of
   Saint Kitts. Further studies are warranted to better understand
   epidemiology, transmission, pathology, and possible reservoir status in
   this species.

   two species are based on type specimens collected from Papua New Guinea
   (Halymenia durvillei and Chrysymenia kaernbachii). Apart from several
   new taxa identified in the collections, there are no endemic species
   known from these shores. As a result of this survey, Laurencia
   columellaris Borgesen is transferred to the genus Chondrophycus, and
   Eupogodon palmatifidus is transfered to the genus Dasya. The discovery
   of the Caribbean genus Rhodogorgon constitutes a major range extension
   as does that of the North Atlantic Nitophyllum punctatum. The deep-water
   alga Renouxia, also known from the south coast of Papua New Guinea, is
   now reported from the north coast, and Polysiphonia polyphysa is
   recorded for the first time since its discovery and description in the
   1850s. The marine red algal flora appears to reflect a typical tropical
   western Pacific component.

AB A partial postcranial skeleton (vertebrae and ribs) of an indeterminate
   sirenian is described from Selminum Tem cave in the Hindenburg Range,
   Western Province of Papua New Guinea. It was derived from a section of
   the Darai Limestone dating to the Burdigalian-Serravallian (early-middle
   Miocene) and representing shallow platform carbonates. The thoracic
   vertebrae are remarkably small, being comparable in size to the
   vertebrae of Nanosiren garciae and implying small body size, although it
   is uncertain whether the specimen represents a diminutive adult or
   juvenile individual. These fossils represent the geologically earliest
   mammal recorded from the island of New Guinea and the earliest evidence
   of Sirenia in Australasia. Thus, this fossil evidence provides a minimum
   date (similar to 11.8 Ma) for the earliest presence of sirenians in
   Australasian coastal marine ecosystems, as well as their primary food
   source, seagrasses.

AB We used a comparative approach to investigate the impact of the disposal
   of gold mine tailings into the ocean near the Lihir mine (Niolam Island,
   Papua New Guinea). We found abundance and diversity of zooplankton,
   micronekton and pelagic fish to be similar or higher in the mine region
   compared to the reference site. We also found relatively high trace
   metal concentrations in lower trophic level groups, especially
   zooplankton, near the mine discharge, but few differences in tissue
   concentrations of micronekton, bait-fish and pelagic fish between the
   two regions. Biomagnification of some trace metals by micronekton, and
   of mercury by fish was evident in both regions. We conclude that ocean
   mine waste disposal at Niolam Island has a local impact on the smaller
   and less mobile pelagic communities in terms of trace metal
   concentrations, but has little effect on the abundance and biodiversity
   of the local food web. Crown Copyright (C) 2012 Published by Elsevier

   Marshall, 1922 and description of 11 new species: A. adustus, sp.n.
   (Bahamas), A. andersoni, sp.n. (Dominican Republic), A. anus, sp.n.
   (Dominican Republic), A. earinusparsus, sp.n. (Dominican Republic), A.

   Island, Turks and Caicos Islands), A. quisqueyanus, sp.n. (Dominican
   Republic), A. stenoculus, sp.n. (Dominican Republic) and A. viridium,
   sp.n. (Dominican Republic). A key to the species and illustrations of
   external and internal structures are provided. Apodrosus is
   characterized as a monophyletic group by two unreversed synapomorphies -
   i.e., the presence of a median fovea on the apex of abdominal sternum
   VII and a J- or Y-shaped spermatheca - and is furthermore differentiated
   from related taxa by a unique combination of diagnostic features
   including the presence of premucro, a complete tegminal plate in males,
   the absence of longitudinal sclerites in the genital chamber of females,
   and an apical projection on the spermathecal cornu. A phylogenetic
   reconstruction of 20 taxa (7 outgroup, 13 ingroup) and 25 morphological
   characters yielded a single most parsimonious cladogram (L=61 steps,
   CI=42, RI=74) with the ingroup topology (A. artist, (A. andersoni, (A.
   earinusparsus, (A. epipolevatus, A. wolcotti)))), (A. eximius, ((A.
   argentatus, A. mammuthus), (A. viridium, (A. stenoculus, (A.
   quisqueyanus, (A. adustus, A. empherefasciatus)))))). The phylogeny
   indicates that Anypotactus bicaudatus Champion (Anypotactini Champion)
   is the sister group to Apodrosus, thereby calling into question the
   traditional tribal placement of this genus in the Polydrusini. The host
   plant associations of most species remain uncertain. A reconstruction of
   the historical biogeography of Apodrosus suggests that post-GAARlandia
   (Greater Antillean+Aves Ridges land span) vicariance was an important
   factor in the diversification of the higher-elevation inhabiting A.
   artus-A. wolcotti clade. Conversely, the species richness of the
   lower-elevation inhabiting A. eximius-A. empherefasciatus clade is most
   plausibly explained through a series of independent and likely more
   recent colonization events from the ancestral source area of
   southwestern Hispaniola to several smaller western Caribbean islands, or
   - in the case of Hispaniola - within-island areas of endemism.

AB The upside-down jellyfish Cassiopea is a globally distributed,
   semi-sessile, planktonically dispersed scyphomedusa. Cassiopea occurs in
   shallow, tropical inshore marine waters on sandy mudflats and is
   generally associated with mangrove-dominated habitats. Controversy over
   the taxonomy of upside-down jellyfishes precedes their introduction to
   the Hawaiian Islands during the Second World War, and persists today.
   Here we address the global phylogeography and molecular systematics of
   the three currently recognized species: Cassiopea andromeda, C.
   frondosa, and C. xamachana. Mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase I (COI)
   sequences from Australia, Bermuda, Fiji, the Florida Keys, the Hawaiian
   Islands, Indonesia, Palau, Panama, Papua New Guinea, and the Red Sea
   were analyzed. Highly divergent COI haplotypes within the putative
   species C. andromeda (23.4% Kimura 2-parameter molecular divergence),
   and shared haplotypes among populations of two separate putative
   species, C. andromeda and C. xamachana from different ocean basins,
   suggest multiple anthropogenic introductions and systematic confusion.
   Two deeply divergent O'ahu haplotypes (20.3%) from morphologically
   similar, geographically separate invasive populations indicate long-term
   ( 14 - 40 million years ago) reproductive isolation of phylogenetically
   distinct source populations and cryptic species. Data support at least
   two independent introductions to the Hawaiian Islands, one from the
   Indo-Pacific, another from the western Atlantic/Red Sea. Molecular
   phylogenetic results support six species: ( 1) C. frondosa, western
   Atlantic ( 2) C. andromeda, Red Sea/western Atlantic/ Hawaiian Islands (
   3) C. ornata, Indonesia/Palau/Fiji ( 4) Cassiopea sp. 1, eastern

AB Although the history of the plantation economy and its land tenure
   legacy have contributed significantly to environmental degradation in
   Caribbean small-island-developing states, in the contemporary period
   multiple drivers are negatively impacting on sensitive ecosystems and
   other natural assets. This paper investigates the complex web of drivers
   of environmental degradation and suggests reforms to attain sustainable
   development in small-island-developing states. It uses St. Lucia as a
   case study. Data were collected from land management experts and key
   stakeholders drawn from the public sector who attended focus group
   workshops. The paper found regulatory land management and administration
   tools were ineffective in protecting the island's fragile, though rich
   biodiversity. The political will to implement regulatory tools was
   lacking, and human resource constraints exacerbated the state's ability
   to deploy measures in managing the demands of the poor, landless, and
   investors on existing natural resources. A major finding was that
   alternative instruments to reduce environmental degradation were
   underutilised. The paper concludes that an environmental governance
   framework combined with robust political will is necessary. It
   recommends that the governance framework should address the current
   failure of regulatory mechanisms and explore potent market instruments,
   behavioural change, new technologies, land tenure reform, and human
   capacity building aimed at mitigating natural resources degradation.
   This paper is useful to policymakers and decision-makers seeking
   solutions for averting deleterious environmental change which
   compromises the attainment of long-term sustainable development of
   small-island-developing states.

AB Australia and New Guinea contain high levels of endemism and

   genetic diversity in fauna occurring throughout the Australo-Papuan
   region. Using extensive geographical sampling, we examined and compared
   the phylogenetic relationships, phylogeography and population structure
   of Anopheles farauti, An. hinesorum and An. irenicus throughout their
   ranges in the southwest Pacific using mitochondrial (mtDNA COI) and
   nuclear (ribosomal protein S9 and ribosomal DNA ITS2) loci. Phylogenetic
   analyses suggest that the ability to utilize humans as hosts has been
   lost repeatedly, coincident with independent colonizations of the
   Solomon Islands. As some of the species under investigation transmit
   malaria in the region, this is a medically important finding. Maximum
   likelihood and Bayesian phylogenetic analyses of nuclear loci also
   showed that the three species are monophyletic. However, putative
   introgression of An. hinesorum mtDNA onto a nuclear background of An.
   farauti was evident in populations from Queensland, Torres Strait and
   southern New Guinea. Haplotype networks and pairwise FST values show
   that there is significant genetic structure within New Guinea and
   Australia in both An. farauti and An. hinesorum, consistent with a
   long-term history of low gene flow among populations.

AB Lead (Pb) is an oceanic pollutant of global concern. Anthropogenic
   activities are increasing oceanic levels, but to an unknown extent. The
   sperm whale (Physeter macrocephalus) has a global distribution and high
   trophic level. The aim of this study was to establish a global baseline
   of oceanic Pb concentrations using free-ranging sperm whales as an
   indicator species. Skin biopsies (n = 337) were collected during the
   voyage of the Odyssey (2000-2005) from 17 regions considering gender and
   age. Pb was detectable in 315 samples with a global mean of 1.6 ug/g ww
   ranging from 0.1 to 129.6 ug/g ww. Papua New Guinea, Bahamas and
   Australia had the highest regional mean with 6.1, 3.4, and 3.1 ug/g ww,
   respectively. Pb concentrations were not significantly different between
   sex and age in males. This is the first global toxicological dataset for
   Pb in a marine mammal and confirms Pb is widely distributed with
   hotspots in some regions. (C) 2014 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Global water research and monitoring typically focus on the household's
   main source of drinking-water. Use of multiple water sources to meet
   daily household needs has been noted in many developing countries but
   rarely quantified or reported in detail. We gathered self-reported data
   using a cross-sectional survey of 405 households in eight communities of
   the Republic of the Marshall Islands (RMI) and five Solomon Islands (SI)
   communities. Over 90% of households used multiple sources, with
   differences in sources and uses between wet and dry seasons. Most RMI
   households had large rainwater tanks and rationed stored rainwater for
   drinking throughout the dry season, whereas most SI households collected
   rainwater in small pots, precluding storage across seasons. Use of a
   source for cooking was strongly positively correlated with use for
   drinking, whereas use for cooking was negatively correlated or
   uncorrelated with nonconsumptive uses (e.g., bathing). Dry season water
   uses implied greater risk of water-borne disease, with fewer (frequently
   zero) handwashing sources reported and more unimproved sources consumed.
   Use of multiple sources is fundamental to household water management and
   feasible to monitor using electronic survey tools. We contend that
   recognizing multiple water sources can greatly improve understanding of
   household-level and community-level climate change resilience, that use
   of multiple sources confounds health impact studies of water
   interventions, and that incorporating multiple sources into water supply
   interventions can yield heretofore-unrealized benefits. We propose that
   failure to consider multiple sources undermines the design and
   effectiveness of global water monitoring, data interpretation,
   implementation, policy, and research.

AB Neodymium isotopic compositions (epsilon(Nd)) and rare earth element
   (REE) concentrations were measured for filtered surface to deep waters
   (112 samples) in the Southern Tropical Pacific. The relatively detailed
   picture of these tracer distributions allowed us to refine the areas
   where oceanic epsilon(Nd) variations occur. epsilon(Nd) values increase
   for most of the water masses flowing from Samoa to the Solomon Sea and
   in the Papua New Guinea (PNG) area, as already observed. Furthermore,
   water masses arriving from the eastern equatorial Pacific (200-550m
   depth) also revealed radiogenic values, possibly acquired in the
   vicinity of the South American coasts and Galapagos Islands. These
   epsilon(Nd) variations affect the whole water column. The most likely
   process causing such variations is "boundary exchange" between the
   numerous radiogenic slopes/margins located in this area and seawater
   flowing past. Dissolution of atmospheric deposition and/or diffuse
   streaming of volcanic ash are also suggested to explain the radiogenic
   epsilon(Nd) observed at the surface in the PNG area. Interestingly, a
   positive europium (Eu) anomaly characterizes the normalized REE patterns
   of most of the studied water masses. This anomaly is consistent with the
   REE patterns of sediment and rock samples that are potential sources for
   the local waters. Such consistency reinforces the hypothesis that
   lithogenic sources play a major role in the oceanic REE budget, thanks
   to "boundary exchange." The data set presented here is a good basis for
   further sampling that will be realized in the framework of the ongoing
   GEOTRACES program (www.geotraces.org). Citation: Grenier, M., C.

AB Increasingly, multi-stakeholder processes have been recognized as being
   necessary to the development of public policies seeking to promote
   systemic innovation in response to complex and multidimensional
   challenges, such as household food security, rural development, and
   environmental change. Saint Lucia, a small island developing state
   located in the Caribbean, has been grappling with a wide range of
   agriculture, food and nutrition security challenges with varying degrees
   of policy success. Recognizing the significance of the challenge, this
   paper explores the nature of the stakeholder interactions surrounding
   the development of Saint Lucia's 2009-2015 National Agricultural Policy
   and considers some of the implications for food and agriculture-related
   policy outcomes. Results reveal a general lack of supportive conditions
   for effective multi-stakeholder processes, including low stakeholder
   participation levels, conflicting roles of different forms of social
   capital in the interactions between stakeholders, and missing "boundary"
   organizations capable of facilitating a transition towards more flexible
   and adaptive institutions, enhanced knowledge exchange and learning, and
   greater trust among stakeholders in the policy network. Future avenues
   for research and development are subsequently identified. (C) 2017 The

AB The Southwest Pacific Ocean Circulation and Climate Experiment (SPICE)
   is an international research program under the auspices of CLIVAR. The
   key objectives are to understand the Southwest Pacific Ocean circulation
   and the South Pacific Convergence Zone (SPCZ) dynamics, as well as their
   influence on regional and basin-scale climate patterns. South Pacific
   thermocline waters are transported in the westward flowing South
   Equatorial Current (SEC) toward Australia and Papua-New Guinea. On its
   way, the SEC encounters the numerous islands and straits of the
   Southwest Pacific and forms boundary currents and jets that eventually
   redistribute water to the equator and high latitudes. The transit in the
   Coral, Solomon, and Tasman Seas is of great importance to the climate
   system because changes in either the temperature or the amount of water
   arriving at the equator have the capability to modulate the El
   Nino-Southern Oscillation, while the southward transports influence the
   climate and biodiversity in the Tasman Sea. After 7 years of substantial
   in situ oceanic observational and modeling efforts, our understanding of
   the region has much improved. We have a refined description of the SPCZ
   behavior, boundary currents, pathways, and water mass transformation,
   including the previously undocumented Solomon Sea. The transports are
   large and vary substantially in a counter-intuitive way, with
   asymmetries and gating effects that depend on time scales. This paper
   provides a review of recent advancements and discusses our current
   knowledge gaps and important emerging research directions.

AB This paper presents the results of an exploratory study into how
   different forms of social capital embedded within community-based social
   networks may affect innovation in smallholder farming systems to better
   support food security in the Caribbean. Focusing on two rural
   communities in the small island developing nation of Saint Lucia, our
   results indicate the strong presence of interpersonal agricultural
   knowledge networks operating to: 1) facilitate farmer-to-farmer
   knowledge exchange; 2) increase farmer access to information; and 3)
   connect farmers to sources of support. In both communities, 'peer
   farmers' were reported as being the primary source of new agricultural
   knowledge for farmers, with government 'extension officers' the
   secondary source. Comparative social network analysis reveals how
   different forms of social capital within the two agricultural knowledge
   networks can affect self-reported farmer innovation in different
   contexts. Based on these findings we identify a number of opportunities
   for policy initiatives to better support, coordinate and enhance
   innovation opportunities among smallholder farmers in the Caribbean with
   a view to building their adaptive capacity in the face of environmental
   change. The findings provide important evidence and insights relevant to
   the governance of domestic agricultural systems and regional food
   security programming in the Caribbean.

AB Recent developments in the seaweed aquaculture industries of Pacific
   islands are reviewed from the perspective of technical, production,
   geographic, marketing, species-diversification, socio-economic and
   institutional-support advances. Successful commercial aquaculture of
   seaweeds in the Pacific island region is presently based on two species,
   Kappaphycus alvarezii in Kiribati, Fiji and Solomon Islands, and
   Cladosiphon sp. in Tonga. It is possible that other candidate species
   could be considered for aquaculture for food (e.g. Caulerpa racemosa or
   Meristotheca procumbens) or extraction of agar (Gracilaria), although
   further research on the technical feasibility of aquaculture methods to
   produce sufficient tonnage, and particularly on their marketing, is
   needed. While the Pacific island region may be environmentally ideal for
   seaweed aquaculture, the limitations of distance from main centres and
   distance from markets, vulnerability to world price fluctuations, and
   socio-economic issues, make it unlikely that the Pacific Island region
   will ever rival the scale of Asian seaweed production. Regional seaweed
   farming can nevertheless make a useful contribution to supplement other
   sources of income, and can be an important economic boost for isolated
   outer islands where few alternative income-generating opportunities
   exist.

AB The Pacific marine biota, particularly species with long planktonic
   larval stages, are thought to disperse widely throughout the Pacific via
   ocean currents. The little genetic data available to date has supported
   this view in that little or no significant regional differentiation of
   populations has been found over large geographical distances. However,
   recent data from giant clams has demonstrated not only significant
   regional differentiation of populations, but routes of gene flow that
   run perpendicular to the main present-day ocean currents. Extensive
   surveys of genetic variation at eight polymorphic loci in 19 populations
   of the giant clam Tridacna maxima, sampled throughout the West and
   Central Pacific, confirmed that the patterns of variation seen so far in
   T. gigas were not unique to that species, and may reflect a fundamental
   genetic structuring of shallow-water marine taxa. Populations of T.
   maxima within highly connected reef systems like the Great Barrier Reef
   were panmictic (average F-ST < 0.003), but highly significant genetic
   differences between reef groups on different archipelagos (average F-ST
   = 0.084) and between West and Central Pacific regions (average F-ST =
   0.156) were found. Inferred gene flew was high (N(c)m usually > 5)
   between the Philippines and the Great Barrier Reef, between the
   Philippines and Melanesia (the Solomon Islands and Fiji), and between
   the Philippines and the Central Pacific island groups (Marshall Islands,
   Kiribati, Tuvalu and Cook Islands). Gene flow was low between these
   three sets of island chains (N(c)m < 2). These routes of gene flow are
   perpendicular to present-day ocean currents. It is suggested that the
   spatial patterns of gene frequencies reflect past episodes of dispersal
   at times of lower sea levels which have not been erased by subsequent
   dispersal by present-day circulation. The patterns are consistent with
   extensive dispersal of marine species in the Pacific, and with
   traditional views of dispersal from the Indo-Malay region. However, they
   demonstrate that dispersal along present-day ocean surface currents
   cannot be assumed, that other mechanisms may operate today or that major
   dispersal events are intermittent (perhaps separated by several
   thousands of years), and that the nature and timing of dispersal of
   Pacific marine species is more complex than has been thought.

AB Discolored (chemically discolored) foraminiferal tests have long been
   known to occur in shallow-water, silici-carbonate sediments of the
   Caribbean, but their distributions and environmental significance have
   been little studied. To address this, nineteen sediment samples were
   collected from the shoreline around St. Kitts (<1 m), eleven from nearby
   coral reefs (6 - 27 m below sea level) and one from a shipwreck, the
   River Taw. Three species and one species-group were examined in detail:
   Amphistegina gibbosa, Archaias angulatus, Asterigerina carinata and
   Peneroplis spp.(= P. carinatus + P. proteus). Discolored specimens were
   either gray or brown. The percentage of this group of species discolored
   per sample was calculated, as was the percentage of each species
   discolored per sample. The percentage of discolored miliolids was
   consistently greater than that of rotaliids. The mean percentage of
   discolored specimens along the shoreline exceeded that on the reefs,
   suggesting that discolored specimens have potential as a proxy for
   palaeodepth. It was, however, greatest around the River Taw. High
   percentages mark areas with either low rates of sediment reworking or
   high levels of iron and manganese associated with the chemical
   alteration of tests. Observations on the River Taw show that discolored
   foraminifera may be used to assess the impact of artificial reefs on
   marine ecosystems.

   eight shared microsatellite loci and haplotypes in a 418-bp mtDNA-CR
   (control region) sequence were examined across 682 P. monodon from
   locations spread widely across its natural range, including the South
   Pacific islands of Fiji, Palau, and Papua New Guinea (PNG). Observed
   microsatellite heterozygosities of 0.82-0.91, allele richness of
   6.85-9.69, and significant mtDNA-CR haplotype variation indicated high
   levels of genetic diversity among the South Pacific shrimp. Analysis of
   microsatellite genotypes using a Bayesian STRUCTURE method segregated
   Indo-Pacific P. monodon into eight distinct clades, with Palau and PNG
   shrimp clustering among others from Southeast Asia and eastern
   Australia, respectively, and Fiji shrimp clustering as a distinct group.
   Phylogenetic analyses of mtDNA-CR haplotypes delineated shrimp into
   three groupings, with shrimp from Fiji again being distinct by sharing
   no haplotypes with other populations. Depending on regional location,
   the genetic structures and substructures identified from the genotyping
   and mtDNA-CR haplotype phylogeny could be explained by Metapopulation
   and/or Member-Vagrant type evolutionary processes. Neutrality tests of
   mutation-drift equilibrium and estimation of the time since population
   expansion supported a hypothesis that South Pacific P. monodon were
   colonized from Southeast Asia and eastern Australia during the
   Pleistocene period over 60,000 years ago when land bridges were more
   expansive and linked these regions more closely.

AB Sustainable development gears towards preserving the environment and
   conserving the rapidly diminishing natural resources such as natural
   resources. This research seeks to assess the performance of crushed
   recycled concrete aggregates (RCA) from Trinidad and Tobago as subbase
   materials in permeable pavement systems (PPS) applicable to urban
   stormwater management systems across the Caribbean small island
   developing states (SIDS). Presently, research is lacking regarding the
   performance of RCA in PPS. These pavement systems are being considered
   as a natural resource conservation attempt, in addition to reducing
   surface water flooding in several towns and cities across these SIDS.
   The project includes laboratory experimental assessment of PPS using RCA
   versus virgin aggregates (limestone from Trinidad and Tobago and basalt
   from St. Lucia) from a stormwater quality, geotechnical and hydrologic
   viewpoint. Stormwater is being collected from various towns and cities
   across the islands and applied uniformly over the pilot scaled permeable
   pavements using a purpose-built rainfall simulator. The permeable
   pavements stormwater treatment efficiencies are being evaluated for the
   removal and retention of nutrients (nitrates and phosphates), heavy
   metals (zinc, lead, copper, iron and manganese), suspended solids and
   turbidity. Hydrologic performances are also being assessed through
   numerous simulated storm events at various intensities. All pavements
   have handled 15-minute high intensity rainfall inputs (in excess of 222
   mm/h) with 100% infiltration (no surface runoff) recorded. In terms of
   total suspended solids (TSS) removal, results showed that removal
   efficiencies varied from 31 to 85% with the RCA test rig recording the
   highest average TSS trapping efficiency of 58%. The test pavement with
   RCA in the subbase has performed similarly or better than those with
   virgin aggregates.

AB "Turrids" are a group of small predatory gastropods that are highly
   diversified in shallow as well as deep water. They sing a hymn to
   specialisation and rarity. A dataset of 34,810 specimens collected
   through a quarter-century of qualitative exploration off New Caledonia
   reveals 1409 species of turrids at depths deeper than 100m. Much of this
   diversity is constituent of the "rare biosphere": as many as 41% are
   singletons, and 73% of the species are represented by empty shells only.
   Species numbers vary with depth, reflecting both differences in sampling
   intensity and in actual species richness. The richest depth interval is
   301-600 m, with 831 species, and a moderately good saturation. By
   contrast, the 601-1000 m interval, with 389 species, is still far from
   saturated. The overlap in species composition with other South Pacific
   tropical island groups (Vanuatu, Fiji, Tonga and the Marquesas) is only
   17%, but we lack data to back up extrapolations at broader geographical
   scales (West Pacific, Indo-Pacific, World Ocean). These results champion
   the slopes of tropical islands, consisting mostly of highly
   heterogeneous hard bottoms, as a vast reservoir of biodiversity.
   However, the technological challenges associated with sampling hard
   bottoms and the geographical remoteness of these target areas combine in
   making these benthic communities among the least sampled and least
   studied in the world. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Mass movements in tropical Pacific small island developing states (SIDS)
   can be devastating although studies are relatively few and contributing
   environmental factors are not often investigated in detail. On 25
   January 2012, following 3 days of heavy monsoonal rainfall (c. 550 mm)
   during a La Nia episode, more than 150 debris flows were triggered in
   the western part of the Ba river catchment of northwest Viti Levu
   island, Fiji. Reconnaissance field survey and geographical information
   system (GIS) analyses using high-resolution satellite imagery were
   carried out to investigate factors that may have led to the occurrence
   of the debris flows in the catchment. We evaluated the correlation
   between the density of mass movements (number of mass movements/km(2))
   and several continuous variables using data measured within the GIS.
   There was a weak but significant positive correlation between mass
   movement density and elevation (r = 0.38, p value < 0.01), cyclonic
   precipitation (r = 0.37, p value < 0.01) and stream density (r = 0.31, p
   value < 0.01). Ninety-three percent of the mass movements occur within a
   plantation of Pinus caribaea (Caribbean pine) on slopes oriented mainly
   to the northeast and east on (trade) windward slopes and may be
   significant factors for their development. Although forests generally
   have a stabilizing effect on slopes, the plantation at Ba was a mature
   stand on its second plantation cycle and is a species that has a shallow
   rooting system making it more susceptible to failure.

AB Aromatic hot peppers (Capsicum chinense Jacq.) are an important
   agricultural commodity for many small-scale farmers in the Caribbean
   because it is a commercially viable crop and one that is integral to the
   cuisines of the region. The large variation in fruit shape, size, color,
   pungency, and aroma of this species facilitates a diverse range of uses.
   Using 264 accessions from a Caribbean germplasm collection (representing
   primarily the Caribbean Basin, Central and South America), this study
   investigated 1) morphological variation in 13 fruit descriptors of
   agro-economic importance; and 2) morphological groups based on
   geographic origin. All 13 fruit descriptors showed significant
   variation. Fruit color [immature (six states) and mature (12 states)]
   was the most diverse qualitative fruit trait. Among the quantitative
   traits, fruit weight and fruit width showed the highest broad-sense
   heritability (0.81), and fruit weight was highly correlated with fruit
   width and placenta size. Cluster analysis revealed four main clusters,
   which did not show a clear separation of accessions based on major
   geographic regions, but there was a highly significant association (P <
   0.0001) between geographic subgroups and the clusters to which they were
   assigned. Most accessions of the Northern Caribbean (particularly the
   Bahamas and Puerto Rico) separated quite distinctly from most accessions
   of the Southern Caribbean and clustered with most accessions of Central
   and South America. Accessions of the Southern Caribbean (Lesser
   Antilles, Trinidad & Tobago) were substantially more similar to each
   other than they were to most accessions of Central and South America,
   thereby suggesting genetic differences between accessions of the
   Southern Caribbean islands and the mainland populations. Collectively,
   the results show that this germplasm collection contains useful
   accessions with desired fruit quality traits and a level of genetic
   variation that can be used to encourage its active conservation and use
   for further evaluation trials and crop improvement as well as guide
   ongoing complementary germplasm introductions to augment the
   collection's diversity.

AB This paper focuses on two of the largest rivers and estuaries of Papua
   New Guinea (PNG), the Fly and Sepik and explores the degree to which
   river input and estuarine reactions affect the rare earth element (REE)
   composition of surface sea water in the western tropical Pacific Ocean.
   The dissolved phases:of the Fly and Sepik River waters have striking REE
   compositions in the form of large MREE-enrichments as defined by a
   gradual increase in their shale normalized ratios toward the middle of
   the REE series. This river/weathering signature is quite distinct from
   the REE composition of Pacific Ocean sea water. Large scale removal of
   dissolved river REE occurs in the low salinity regions of the Fly and
   Sepik River estuaries due to the coagulation of Fe-humic colloids.
   Laboratory experiments show that the reaction of Fly River particles
   with sea water leads to the preferential release of MREE to estuarine
   waters. Additional experiments suggest that the development of
   MREE-enrichments in PNG rivers is associated with phosphate minerals and
   their aquatic chemistry. The development of MREE-enrichments in the Fly
   and Sepik Rivers, through the combination of weathering and estuarine
   reactions, provides what is termed an island weathering signature to the
   ocean waters of the western tropical Pacific Ocean. MREE-enrichments
   appear in the high salinity estuarine waters surrounding PNG and in the
   subsurface waters of the equatorial (150 degrees E) Pacific Ocean north
   of PNG (station SA-5 of Zhang and Nozaki [Zhang, J., Nozaki, Y., 1996,
   Rare earth elements and yttrium in seawater: ICP-MS determinations in
   the East Caroline, Coral Sea, and South Fill basins of the western South
   Pacific Ocean. Geochim. Cosmochim, Acta 60, 4631-4644.]). We interpret
   MREE-enrichments in the Pacific Equatorial Undercurrent (P-EUC) at SA-5
   to reflect the entrainment of an island weathering signature by the
   regional currents. The REE data in this paper support, but do not
   conclusively confirm, the proposition of Gordon et al. [Gordon, R.M.,
   Coale, K.H., Johnson, K.S., 1997. Iron distributions in the equatorial
   Pacific: implications for new production. Limnol. Oceanogr. 42,
   419-431.] that there is transport of Fe and other lithogenic elements
   across the Pacific Ocean within the Equatorial Undercurrent. While they
   suggested volcanism and hydrothermal activity in the region of PNG to be
   the source of the lithogenic elements, we favour the hypothesis of
   Milliman et al. [Milliman, J.D., Farnsworth, K.L., Albertin, C.S., 1999.
   Flux and fate of fluvial sediments leaving large islands in the East
   Indies, J. Sea Res. 41, 97-107.] that the massive weathering of islands
   in the East Indies is a quantitatively more important source. This
   process involves the entrainment of dissolved and particulate matter
   from island rivers into the Bismarck Archipelago Undercurrents, which
   originate in the Coral Sea and move to the P-EUC through the Solomon and
   Bismarck Seas. Specifically, our REE data are consistent with
   hydrographical and sedimentological studies which show that the rivers
   on New Guinea's north coast directly inject their dissolved and
   particulate matter into the New Guinea Coastal Undercurrent (NGCU),
   which feeds the Equatorial Undercurrent. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V.

AB Background: The mosquito Culex annulirostris Skuse (Diptera: Culicidae)
   is the major vector of endemic arboviruses in Australia and is also
   responsible for the establishment of the Japanese encephalitis virus
   (JEV) in southern Papua New Guinea (PNG) as well as its incursions into
   northern Australia. Papua New Guinea and mainland Australia are
   separated by a small stretch of water, the Torres Strait, and its
   islands. While there has been regular JEV activity on these islands, JEV
   has not established on mainland Australia despite an abundance of Cx.
   annulirostris and porcine amplifying hosts. Despite the public health
   significance of this mosquito and the fact that its adults show
   overlapping morphology with close relative Cx. palpalis Taylor, its
   evolution and genetic structure remain undetermined. We address a
   hypothesis that there is significant genetic diversity in Cx.
   annulirostris and that the identification of this diversity will shed
   light on the paradox that JEV can cycle on an island 70 km from mainland
   Australia while not establishing in Australia itself.
   Results: We sequenced 538 bp of the mitochondrial DNA cytochrome oxidase
   I gene from 273 individuals collected from 43 localities in Australia
   and the southwest Pacific region to describe the phylogeography of Cx.
   annulirostris and its sister species Cx. palpalis. Maximum Likelihood
   and Bayesian analyses reveal supporting evidence for multiple divergent
   lineages that display geographic restriction. Culex palpalis contained
   three divergent lineages geographically restricted to southern
   Australia, northern Australia and Papua New Guinea (PNG). Culex
   annulirostris contained five geographically restricted divergent
   lineages, with one lineage restricted to the Solomon Islands and two
   identified mainly within Australia while two other lineages showed
   distributions in PNG and the Torres Strait Islands with a southern limit
   at the top of Australia's Cape York Peninsula.
   Conclusion: The existence of divergent mitochondrial lineages within Cx.
   annulirostris and Cx. palpalis helps explain the difficulty of using
   adult morphology to identify Cx. annulirostris and its ecological
   diversity. Notably, the southern limit of the PNG lineages of Cx.
   annulirostris coincides exactly with the current southern limit of JEV
   activity in Australasia suggesting that variation in these COI lineages
   may be the key to why JEV has not yet established yet on mainland
   Australia.

   Grenada, Barbados and Tobago in the southeastern Caribbean Sea. Of 991
   D. antillarum urchins inspected, 298 (30.07%) hosted decapod crabs with
   an average of 0.49 crabs per urchin. The frequency of crabs associating
   with urchins varied geographically, being highest in Bequia (56.68%) and
   Grenada (40.74%), and lowest in Barbados (6.73% and 5.63% at two sites)
   and Mayreau (13.33%). Of 487 crabs observed, Percnon gibbesi was the
   most common species (79.05% of all crabs) followed by unidentified
   (possibly Pagurus spp.) hermit crabs (8.21%), Stenorhynchus seticornis
   (6.98%), and unidentified greyish (5.75%) and reddish (0.82%) crabs
   (possibly Mithraculus coryphe and M. forceps, respectively). The causes
   of geographic as well as temporal variation in the association of crabs
   with urchins remain obscure. However, the rarity of crabs in Barbados
   might be attributable to the frequent use of motorized water craft.
   Long-term temporal trends in the association of crabs with urchins may
   be linked with large-scale population dynamics of D. antillarum.

AB To inform a community-based ocean zoning initiative, we conducted an
   intensive ecological assessment of the marine ecosystems of Barbuda,
   West Indies. We conducted 116 fish and 108 benthic surveys around the
   island, and measured the abundance and size structure of lobsters and
   conch at 52 and 35 sites, respectively. We found that both coral cover
   and fish biomass were similar to or lower than levels observed across
   the greater Caribbean; live coral cover and abundance of fishery target
   species, such as large snappers and groupers, was generally low.
   However, Barbuda lacks many of the high-relief forereef areas where
   similar work has been conducted in other Caribbean locations. The
   distribution of lobsters was patchy, making it difficult to quantify
   density at the island scale. However, the maximum size of lobsters was
   generally larger than in other locations in the Caribbean and similar to
   the maximum size reported 40 years ago. While the lobster population has
   clearly been heavily exploited, our data suggest that it is not as
   overexploited as in much of the rest of the Caribbean. Surveys of
   Barbuda's Codrington Lagoon revealed many juvenile lobsters, but none of
   legal size (95 mm carapace length), suggesting that the lagoon functions
   primarily as nursery habitat. Conch abundance and size on Barbuda were
   similar to that of other Caribbean islands. Our data suggest that many
   of the regional threats observed on other Caribbean islands are present
   on Barbuda, but some resources-particularly lobster and conch-may be
   less overexploited than on other Caribbean islands. Local management has
   the potential to provide sustainability for at least some of the
   island's marine resources. We show that a rapid, thorough ecological
   assessment can reveal clear conservation opportunities and facilitate
   rapid conservation action by providing the foundation for a
   community-driven policymaking process at the island scale.

   increased variability from December to May (when the winds over the sea
   are weak). The seasonal velocity signal has the largest magnitude
   narrowly along the double western boundary formed by the eastern
   coastlines of New Guinea and the Solomon Islands, suggesting that direct
   wind driving with its much larger spatial scales is not the main
   influence. In addition, the surface circulation exhibits substantial
   interannual variability of magnitude comparable to that of the seasonal
   cycle with velocity and temperature anomalies consistent with changes in
   the western boundary current acting to compensate for the discharge and
   recharge of the Pacific warm pool during ENSO.

AB Numerical wind mapping is currently the wind power industry's standard
   for preliminary assessments for sites of good wind resources. Of the
   various available numerical models, numerical weather prediction (NWP)
   models are best suited for modeling mesoscale wind flows across small
   islands. In this study, the Weather Research and Forecast (WRF) NWP
   model was optimized for simulating the wind resources of the Caribbean
   islands of Trinidad and Tobago in terms of spin-up period for developing
   mesoscale features, the input initial and boundary conditions, and the
   planetary boundary layer (PBL) parameterizations. Hourly model
   simulations of wind speed and wind direction for a one-month period were
   compared with corresponding 10 m level wind observations. The National
   Center for Environmental Prediction (NCEP)-Department of Energy (DOE)
   reanalysis of 1.875 degrees horizontal resolution was found to be better
   suited to provide initial and boundary conditions (ICBCs) over the 1
   degrees resolution NCEP final analysis (FNL); 86% of modeled wind speeds
   were within +/- 2 m/s of measured values at two locations when the
   coarse resolution NCEP reanalysis was used as compared with 55-64% of
   modeled wind speeds derived from FNL. Among seven PBL schemes tested,
   the Yonsei University PBL scheme with topographic drag enabled minimizes
   the spatial error in wind speed (mean bias error + 0.16 m/s,
   root-mean-square error 1.53 m/s and mean absolute error 1.21 m/s) and is
   capable of modeling the bimodal wind speed histogram. These sensitivity
   tests provide a suitable configuration for the WRF model for mapping the
   wind resources over Trinidad and Tobago, which is a factor in developing
   a wind energy sector in these islands.

AB A two-year long record from a triangular mooring array between the
   Lesser Antilles islands Tobago, Barbados, and St. Lucia is used to
   investigate the inflow into the Caribbean Sea, the amount of South
   Atlantic Water (SAW) carried with the inflow, and the role of North
   Brazil Current (NBC) rings in the observed variability. The data set
   consists of time series from temperature/conductivity recorders and
   current meters in the moorings, bottom-mounted inverted echo sounders at
   the Tobago and St. Lucia mooring positions, and supplementary shipboard
   measurements. The acoustic travel time measurements of the inverted echo
   sounders and the conductivity/temperature time series are used for
   continuous estimation of dynamic height profiles and geostrophic
   currents between the surface and 1000 dbar as well as the amount of SAW
   found at the mooring positions.
   The observations show a domination of intraseasonal variability between
   0 and 15 Sv, superimposed on the long-term fluctuations. With time
   scales of one to three months, these represent the signature of the NBC
   rings. The baroclinic transport time series shows nine periods of
   increased variability, indicative of the rings interacting with the
   Lesser Antilles island arc; with the exception of one, these periods
   were associated with corresponding sea surface height anomalies. No
   marked seasonality was observed in the transport variability or the ring
   frequency.
   The arrival of individual rings leads to a weakening of the inflow into
   the Caribbean. Nevertheless, the rings carry large amounts of SAW into
   the area, and the immediate increase of the transport towards the end of
   a ring event suggests a subsequent flow of this SAW-rich water into the
   Caribbean. At St. Lucia, rings sometimes cause a short-term decrease of
   SAW content, indicative of an influx of northern hemispheric water and a
   blocking situation. The average transport of SAW into the Caribbean
   south of St. Lucia during the observations amounted to 5.5 Sv, with no
   significant seasonal cycle, but a small positive trend in SAW fraction
   as well as in transport of about 15% and 1 Sv, respectively; a
   corresponding trend in the baroclinic volume transport was not observed.

AB This study analyzes 25 years of Special Sensor Microwave Imager (SSM/I)
   retrievals of rain rate and wind speed to assess changes in storminess
   over the open water of the Pacific Ocean. Changes in storminess are
   characterized by combining trends in both the statistically derived 95th
   percentile exceedance frequencies of rain rate and wind speed (i.e.,
   extremes). Storminess is computed annually and seasonally, with further
   partitioning done by phase of the El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO)
   index and the Pacific decadal oscillation (PDO) index. Overall,
   rain-rate exceedance frequencies of 6-8 mm h(-1) cover most of the
   western and central tropical Pacific, with higher values present around
   the Philippines, Japan, Mexico, and the northwest coast of Australia.
   Wind speed exceedance frequencies are a strong function of latitude,
   with values less (greater) than 12 m s(-1) equatorward (poleward) of 30
   degrees N/S. Statistically significant increasing trends in rain rate
   were found in the western tropical Pacific near the Caroline Islands and
   the Solomon Islands, and in the extratropics from the Aleutian Islands
   down the coast along British Columbia and Washington State.
   Statistically significant increasing trends in wind speed are present in
   the equatorial central Pacific near Kiribati and the Republic of the
   Marshall Islands (RMI), and in the extratropics along the west coast of
   the United States and Canada. Thus, while extreme rain and winds are
   both increasing across large areas of the Pacific, these areas are
   modulated according to the phase of ENSO and the PDO, and their
   intersection takes aim at specific locations.

AB The plantation era in the Caribbean was characterised by significant
   ecological degradation and change through the shift to sugar
   monoculture, and the introduction of exotic taxa to the island, leading
   to the extensive depletion of native flora and fauna. During European
   colonial rule in this region, marginalised and enslaved communities
   developed informal domestic economies such as artisanal fishing,
   small-scale animal husbandry and agriculture to survive within this
   oppressive structure. Zooarchaeology from this period offers insight
   into the variability of historical human eco-dynamics, and how these
   pasts impact modern social, economic and ecological systems. This study
   presents archaeological case studies from three plantation sites in the
   Lesser Antilles, from the islands of Martinique, Barbados and Dominica,
   to illustrate the potential contributions of historical archaeology to
   understanding long-term human-environment interaction, and explore the
   ecological consequences of colonialism in the Caribbean. Results of
   faunal analysis at the three sites suggest that resilient, small-scale
   subsistence and economic practices that persist today began during
   slavery, and that these data provide a more nuanced picture of past and
   present issues of biodiversity, ecosystem health and food security in
   the Caribbean.

AB The unsustainable use of soil natural capital and ecosystem services is
   of global concern due to damage and losses on a worldwide scale. This
   situation is further compounded in small island developing states
   (SIDS), such as the Caribbean, where rapid population growth coupled
   with limited land space accelerates the rate of degradation of soil
   natural capital. The Aripo savanna is the largest surviving natural
   savanna in Trinidad with economic and scientific importance. Presently,
   there are many different land uses and land covers competing for space
   to the detriment of soil ecosystem services in this savanna. An
   ecosystem framework approach is needed to guide the development of
   adaptation strategies to improve the resilience of soil ecosystem for
   the provisioning of services, especially in the face of climate change.
   We reviewed the existing literature on soil ecosystem management in SIDS
   with particular emphasis on Aripo savanna and attempted to provide a
   better understanding of soil processes by developing frameworks for
   assessing tropical small island soil ecosystem services and soil health.
   In tropical island states, poor soil quality has been associated with
   indiscriminant land use, creating short-term economic viability.
   Short-term economic viability is characterized by poor practices,
   negatively impacting on soil and thus limiting its ability to perform
   ecosystem services. To improve the resilience of a society, an
   ecosystem-framework approach becomes necessary. Soil ecosystem health,
   however, cannot be represented solely by specific land use(s)/land
   cover(s) (LULC) but by critical descriptors that influence soil quality.
   This review highlights the importance of an ecosystem framework approach
   for the sustainable management and optimization of soil natural capital
   and ecosystem services in the Caribbean SIDS.

AB The lack of access to modern energy services, sometimes also referred to
   as energy poverty, is a significant global development challenge. This
   paper provides an analysis of energy access in Small Island Developing
   States (SIDS), sheds light on current challenges and provides insights
   on opportunities to improve access to modern energy services in these
   countries. It provides an overview of energy access levels within the
   African, Caribbean and Pacific SIDS regions to refocus attention on
   their frail economies and dependence on imported fossil fuels. The focus
   here is on three specific factors that are still not well investigated:
   issues which relate to grid-extension, the lack of trained personnel for
   decentralised electrification and a high reliance on imported energy
   which drains Gross Domestic Product (GDP). A selection of SIDS case
   studies highlighting endeavours to expand energy access provide a basis
   on which key measures to expand electrification are suggested. Enabling
   conditions identified included a high level of commitment from the
   government and the setting up of an independent regulatory body with
   rulemaking and adjudicative powers. Additionally, the setting up of a
   cost-reflective tariff structure and appropriate fiscal framework are
   highlighted which can contribute towards electricity access expansion in
   island context.

AB Energy supply sustainahiliti is a multifaceted challenge d especially
   especialll for small island n might have limited adaptive capacity.
   Previous studies showed that islands experience energy city and is from
   energy markets due to their remote location. Our focus is on a range of
   islands spread out globally: Cyprus; Curacao, Mauritius; Iceland;
   Jamaica, Trinidad and Tobago and Bahrain. They are selected for their
   varying energy development paradigms that facilitate cluster
   elicitation. For the first time, we combine the estimation of fuel mix
   diversity and energy import dependence with established metrics
   Shannon-Wiener index (SWI); flerfindahlHirschman index (11111) and
   Energy Import Dependence to assess energy supply security. SW1 and
   Energy Import Dependence are then presented against carbon intensity to
   highlight two angles of sustainable energy supply. We argue that islands
   are clustered to those that have fossil fuel reserves and are locked in
   low diversity, low dependence and high carbon intensity, those that rely
   almost exclusively on imported fossil fuel reserves and have low
   diversity and high dependence and high carbon intensity and finally
   those that have entered a decarbonization trajectory that allows them to
   reduce their fossil fuel import dependence, increase their diversity and
   reduce their carbon intensity. (C) 2017 The Authors. Published by

AB The combination of rising sea level and increased storminess that is
   expected to accompany changes in global climate due to the greenhouse
   effect may well have severe impacts on low-lying coral islands in
   tropical oceans.  This paper deals principally with the atoll island
   states of Kiribati, Maldives, Marshall Islands, Tokelau and Tuvalu which
   comprise only coral-rubble islands with land rarely rising more than 3 m
   above present sea level.  Their combined populations are about 300,000,
   and since colonial times, island economies have not achieved
   self-sufficiency.  Presently they are substantially dependent on foreign
   aid and remittances from islanders who work overseas.  The situation is
   worsening as natural resources decline, populations grow, aspirations
   for better living standards increase and the terms of trade worsen. 
   Atoll island ecology and the ability to sustain human habitation depend
   in large part on fresh ground water reserves which are related to island
   size.  Ground water degradation due to greenhouse-induced coastal
   erosion and inundation of low-lying ground will further reduce
   agricultural productivity and other island resources.  The economic and
   social viability of atoll island states in the future is therefore
   doubtful; their people may become the first environmental refugees of
   the greenhouse era.

AB Odors and volatile organic compounds (VOCs) are typical products of
   industrial processes that may cause nuisances and potential
   environmental threats. Biofiltration is a mature technology that employs
   a biofilm and a water layer to eliminate odorous compounds and several
   pollutants in the exhaust gases. It has demonstrated to be economically
   and technically efficient. No publication was found regarding the
   utilization of biofilters in African and Caribbean countries (AF & CA);
   therefore, the purpose of this research was to assess the potential of
   biofiltration to be established in these regions. After an exhaustive
   literature review and the utilization of an online survey, several
   outputs regarding its potential to be implemented in these regions were
   found. Results indicate that South Africa and Nigeria represent the most
   feasible countries for a prompt establishment. In the case of the
   Caribbean countries, in the Dominican Rep., Jamaica and Trinidad and
   Tobago emission targets for some VOCs in particular industrial sectors
   were found. However, in the case of Cuba this information was very
   restricted. The preliminary survey indicated that people recognize there
   are problems with odors, though, biofiltration was practically unknown
   by the participants. The results of this research indicate that
   Biofiltration is an emission control technology that has considerable
   applicability in both regions and its introduction will benefit
   remarkably several productive sectors in order to enable them to comply
   with regulations, and towards further implementation of sustainable
   technologies for the protection of the environment, while fostering
   improvement to human health.

AB [1] The partial pressure of CO2 (pCO(2)) was measured at daily and
   weekly time scales in the waters surrounding mangrove forests in Papua
   New Guinea, the Bahamas and India. The pCO(2) values range from 380 to
   4800 muatm. These data, together with previously published data, suggest
   that overall oversaturation of CO2 with respect to atmospheric
   equilibrium in surface waters is a general feature of mangrove forests,
   though the entire ecosystems (sediment, water and vegetation) are
   probably sinks for atmospheric CO2. The computed CO2 fluxes converge to
   about +50 mmolC m(-2) day(-1). If this conservative value is
   extrapolated for worldwide mangrove ecosystems, the global emission of
   CO2 to the atmosphere is about 50 10(6) tC year(-1). Based on this
   tentative estimate, mangrove waters appear to be regionally a
   significant source of CO2 to the atmosphere and should be more
   thoroughly investigated, especially at seasonal time scale.

AB Aim To identify connectivity patterns among coral reefs of the Indo-West
   Pacific. Projecting connectivity forward in time provides a framework
   for studying long-term source-sink dynamics in the region, and makes it
   possible to evaluate the manner in which migration shapes population
   genetic structure at regional scales. This information is essential for
   addressing critical gaps in knowledge for conservation planning efforts
   in one of the most biologically diverse regions on earth.
   Location Coral reefs of the Indo-West Pacific, ranging from 15 degrees S
   to 30 degrees N and 95 degrees E to 140 degrees E.
   Methods Individual-based biophysical dispersal models were used in
   conjunction with matrix projection to identify the expected patterns of
   exchange between coral reefs over time.
   Results Present-day oceanographic conditions lead to the transport of
   larvae from the South China Sea into the Coral Triangle region via the
   Sulu Sea, and from northern Papua New Guinea and the Solomon Islands via
   Halmahera. The directionality of the system leads to the expected
   accumulation of organisms from outlying areas into the Coral Triangle
   region over time, particularly in the vicinity of the Maluku Islands and
   eastern Sulawesi. Coral reefs in Papua New Guinea, the Sulu Archipelago
   and areas within the Philippines are expected to be areas of high
   diversity as well.
   Main conclusions Biophysical dispersal models, used in conjunction with
   matrix projection, provide an effective means of simulating connectivity
   structure across the Indo-West Pacific and thereby evaluating the
   directionality of genetic diversity. Migration appears to have a
   significant influence on population genetic structure in the region.
   Based on present-day ocean currents, coral reefs in the South China Sea,
   northern Papua New Guinea and the Solomon Islands are contributing to
   high levels of diversity in the Coral Triangle.

AB The interannual variability of annual and monthly rainfall in Haiti is
   examined from a database of 78 rain gauges in 1905-2005. The spatial
   coherence of annual rainfall is rather low, which is partly due to
   Haiti's rugged landscape, complex shoreline, and surrounding warm waters
   (mean sea surface temperatures > 27 degrees C from May to December). The
   interannual variation of monthly rainfall is mostly shaped by the
   intensity of the low-level winds across the Caribbean Sea, leading to a
   drier-(or wetter-) than-average rainy season associated with easterly
   (or westerly) anomalies, increasing (or decreasing) winds. The varying
   speed of low-level easterlies across the Caribbean basin may reflect at
   least four different processes during the year: (1) an anomalous
   trough/ridge over the western edge of the Azores high from December to
   February, peaking in January; (2) a zonal pressure gradient between
   Eastern Pacific and the tropical Northern Atlantic from May/June to
   September, with a peak in August (i. e. lower-than-average rainfall in
   Haiti is associated with positive sea level pressure anomalies over the
   tropical North Atlantic and negative sea level pressure anomalies over
   the Eastern Pacific); (3) a local ocean-atmosphere coupling between the
   speed of the Caribbean Low Level Jet and the meridional sea surface
   temperature (SST) gradient across the Caribbean basin (i.e.
   colder-than-average SST in the southern Caribbean sea is associated with
   increased easterlies and below-average rainfall in Haiti). This coupling
   is triggered when the warmest Caribbean waters move northward toward the
   Gulf of Mexico; (4) in October/November, a drier-(or wetter-) than-usual
   rainy season is related to an almost closed anticyclonic (or cyclonic)
   anomaly located ENE of Haiti on the SW edge of the Azores high. This
   suggests a main control of the interannual variations of rainfall by
   intensity, track and/or recurrence of tropical depressions traveling
   northeast of Haiti. During this period, the teleconnection of Haitian
   rainfall with synchronous Atlantic and Eastern Pacific SST is at a
   minimum.

AB Human induced climate change is having a dramatic impact on global
   biodiversity and insular assemblages are particularly vulnerable.
   However, the cascading impacts of tropical cyclones on insular
   ecosystems are poorly understood and expected to grow with the
   increasing intensity of these events associated with future
   anthropogenic climate change. This problem is particularly relevant to
   islands of the Southwest Pacific, which are cyclone prone and support
   high levels of endemic biodiversity. In this perspective, we present new
   information from a case study of the indirect effects of a tropical
   cyclone (Ita) on forest extent and integrity from an endemic hotspot,
   the Louisiade Archipelago of Papua New Guinea. We highlight how a
   cyclone event can be a catalyst for human coping strategies that
   increase pressures on forest ecosystems and expose them to invasive
   plant species. These changes represent a major threat to
   forest-dependent bird species, many of which are endemic. Rather than
   being an isolated example, these observations provide an insight into
   human responses to climate change over cyclone-prone tropical
   islands/regions where human populations are reliant upon subsistence
   agriculture and the resources provided by forests. The cumulative
   anthropogenic impacts on forest ecosystems are potentially catastrophic
   to the future of island biodiversity and greater than the long-term
   shifts in mean climate. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Coral reef assemblages, trophic interactions, and food web stability
   were examined across a remote and densely populated atoll, in the
   Republic of the Marshall Islands (RMI). The biomass of sharks,
   large-bodied piscivores, and secondary invertebrate consumers was
   expectedly larger in the absence of major human populations. Less
   intuitively, we report a doubling in the density and biomass of
   small-bodied acanthurids with significant human presence, whereas
   large-bodied parrotfishes were halved. These trends provided evidence
   for prey release of small acanthurids, but also indicated a reduction in
   grazing function given that power-law relationships govern fish size and
   physiology. Path analyses supported the conjecture that apex predator
   biomass enhanced the abundance of large-bodied herbivores, with ensuing
   benefits to calcifying benthic substrates and coral diversity. Human
   populations, as low as 40 individuals, had opposing linked interactions.
   The study next used species abundances to depict food chain interaction
   strengths, and multivariate measures of heterogeneity to depict food
   chain diversity. The removal of few strong links along the gradient of
   investigation (i.e. Acropora corals and sharks), as well as numerous
   weak links, was associated with fish assemblages and benthic substrates
   that had reduced grazing and calcification potential, respectively. The
   results inferred that a reduction in the functional response time of
   trophic guilds will follow perturbations (i.e. reduce stability),
   synonymous to food webs with low return rates to their modeled, stable
   con figuration. This study provides a broader perspective for
   interpreting how humans and apex predators influence ecological
   stability across (RMI) coral reef ecosystems.

AB This report describes for the first time the supply chain of Caulerpa
   racemosa in three Pacific Island countries. The harvesting and marketing
   of C. racemosa are important subsistence activities for villagers in
   Fiji and Samoa, less so in Tonga. At least 150 harvesters are involved
   in Fiji, some 100 in Samoa and only a handful in Tonga. The annual
   combined crop is of some 123 t valued at around US$266,492. In Fiji, it
   is projected that supply does not meet local demand and there is a
   potential export market that is currently operating at a pilot project
   level. In Samoa, the supply is considered adequate for the current
   market. In Tonga, harvesting is carried out by a few families and
   supplies a niche market in that country. The possibilities of field
   cultivation of Caulerpa have been explored but, at present, with only
   limited success in Samoa. The supply chain is simple in all three
   countries, and only in Fiji are middlemen involved in the distribution
   process. The limitations for marketing include the fact that only a few
   sites supply most of the crop in all the three countries, that all sites
   need to be conserved through sustainable harvesting methods, the short
   shelf life of the crop and a lack of information on the carrying
   capacity of harvest sites. Caulerpa remains a crop that fulfils a niche
   market but has the potential to be scaled up for additional livelihood
   development in the future.

AB Small island developing States (SIDS) have narrow resource bases and are
   usually extremely reliant on fossil fuel based energy for transport and
   electricity generation. These island economies are thus particularly
   vulnerable to the impacts of peak oil and also to climate change,
   impacts which are likely to not only hamper economic development but
   also adversely affect the quality of life of local inhabitants. In order
   to reduce the vulnerability of SIDS to peak oil, an urgent transition to
   renewable sources of energy is necessary. This paper propounds that the
   reform of power sector that took place in Caribbean and Pacific SIDS
   (particularly between 1970 and 2000) should have been viewed as an
   opportunity to re-orient power producers away from the proclivity to
   utilise conventional fossil fuel uses. Reasons why reform measures did
   not result in a substantive transition are put forward. Moreover,
   recommendations towards facilitating a transition to renewable energy in
   the power sector through future reforms are proposed.

   flux from a leaking septic tank. Long Haul Bay was comparatively
   undeveloped. SHE Community Structure Investigations (SHECSIs) revealed
   that the populations on five plants had logarithmic series distributions
   of species abundances, the slopes of lnS vs. lnE for these five
   time-series being within - 1 +/- 0.3. In three time-series, they were
   within - 1 +/- 0.05.
   Cluster analysis of twenty-five sediment samples in shallow water (<3 m)
   indicates that Nevis is largely surrounded by a single thanatacoenosis,
   for which SHECSI indicates a logarithmic series population structure.
   However, it is not possible to reconstruct perfectly the epiphytal
   population from the sediment thanatacoenosis. The thanatacoenosis
   included 40% allochthonous Amphistegina gibbosa, Archaias angulatus and
   Asterigerina carinata, washed in from offshore reefs, and few
   planorbulinids, although the latter dominates the biocoenosis on
   seagrass leaves in the backreef.

   Spratelloides lewisi between 1984 and 1989 were examined at one or more
   sites in the Solomon Islands, Papua New Guinea and Maldives. At all
   sites, all species recruited throughout the year. There was no
   difference between months in the proportion of recruits in the fished
   population of any species at any site.
   The relative abundance of recruits of E. devisi, E. heterolobus, S.
   delicatulus and S. lewisi between 1984 and 1989 was examined at Munda
   and Tulagi in the Solomon Islands. There were no detectable differences
   between months or sites for any species, although the interannual
   variability in recruitment in some months was quite high. Both the
   relative abundance of recruits and variation in recruitment of both
   Encrasicholina species were correlated at both sites.
   Adult stock size was the most important factor that explained variation
   in recruitment 2 months later and accounted for between 30 and 85% of
   the variation in recruitment of each species at the two sites.
   Environmental factors such as zooplankton biomass, wind or monthly
   rainfall were not correlated with recruitment of any species at either
   site. Nor was predation by adults an important source of egg or larval
   mortality. All species preyed on Encrasicholina eggs and larvae at some
   time during the year and Encrasicholina species were the most important
   predators at both sites. However, unlike some temperate clupeoids, these
   species ate less than 1% of the estimated daily egg production each
   month during the study.
   Overall, there was little variation in recruitment of Encrasicholina or
   Spratelloides species. Most of the monthly estimates of the relative
   abundance of recruits of each species did not differ from the long-term
   mean at each site by more than an order of magnitude. We hypothesise
   that the lower variability in recruitment compared with temperate
   clupeoids results from a combination of their multiple-spawning
   reproductive strategy, rapid growth and early recruitment. For these
   species, prerecruit mortality appears to be relatively constant.

AB Herbivorous fish occupy an important niche in coral reef ecosystems.
   Specifically, damselfish of the genus Stegastes have been shown to have
   a significant impact on coral community structure and algal assemblages.
   This study investigated the algal communities associated with Stegastes
   territories of the Indo-Pacific (Fiji, Solomon Islands, and Tonga),
   while concurrently examining the effects of nutrient enrichment and
   herbivore exclusion (alone and in unison) on these communities. Results
   evidenced differences in species composition, percent c over, and algal
   growth rate between Stegastes territories and non-Stegastes sites and
   between control sites and treatment sites. Stegastes territories
   consistently displayed a greater abundance of turf algae than
   non-Stegastes sites; the two main genera of turf algae observed at all
   sites were Polysiphonia and Ceramium. Although non-Stegastes sites in
   Fiji, the Solomon Islands, and Tonga showed a greater percent coverage
   of macroalgae, they contained fewer algal species compared to Stegastes
   territories. In Fiji, red macroalgae decreased in the herbivore
   exclusion treatments, while brown macroalgae increased significantly in
   the herbivore exclusion and nutrient treatments. The combined effect of
   the herbivore exclusion and nutrient treatment at this location yielded
   a significantly increased turf algae growth rate compared to control
   sites. Growth rates of turf algae in the Solomon Islands and Tonga
   increased significantly in caged treatments, suggesting that damselfish
   of the genus Stegastes can play an important role in maintaining cropped
   algal beds. In summation, the results demonstrated that Stegastes
   sustains distinct algal assemblages which may be disrupted by reduced
   grazing and/or eutrophication. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights

AB Climatic trends in the southeastern Antilles island chain are analysed
   via reanalysis datasets in the period 1980-2014. Although a homogeneous
   marine climate surrounds these small islands embedded in northeast trade
   winds, the analysis presented here reveals spatial gradients in climatic
   trends during the satellite era. In the axis of the fresh North Brazil
   Current, sea surface temperature (SST) trends are steep (+0.04 degrees
   Cyear(-1)) and correspond with weaker winds and rising ozone
   concentrations (+0.15DUyear(-1)). Subsidence and meridional wind trends
   are related to an acceleration in the Hadley overturning atmospheric
   circulation which heats the trade wind inversion. Expanded wind shadows
   induce warmer SST, greater latent heat flux and deeper convection west
   of the Antilles islands. While rainfall has decreased in Trinidad and
   eastern Venezuela, the mountainous islands of Guadeloupe, Dominica and
   Martinique have increasing rainfall (+0.02mmday(-1)year(-1)) in the
   satellite era. Weakening ocean currents near Grenada may reflect a
   diminishing of the global thermohaline meridional overturning
   circulation.

AB In western Micronesia, sea levels are rising at three to four times the
   global average, saltwater intrusion is impacting freshwater supplies and
   food production, and local cultures are being forced to respond. Yap
   State, Federated States of Micronesia (9.5N, 138E), consists of a
   cluster of four main islands (MI) and 14 coral atolls and smaller outer
   islands (OI) spread over 400,000 km2 of ocean. This paper examines three
   aspects of Yap State's adaptive capacity to climate change impacts: 1)
   differences in environmental conditions between the MI and OI; 2)
   relevant features of the MI's cultural heritage; and 3) relevant
   features of OI's cultural heritage, including values and practices
   surrounding the sawei system relationship. Cultural support networks in
   both the MI and OI will almost certainly be relied upon to lessen the
   severity of climate change impacts, perhaps especially as more OI
   residents relocate to the MI. More research is needed to document how
   features of intangible cultural heritage that create and maintain social
   resilience in Yap State will shape residents' adaptive capacity to
   climate change.

AB Caribbean reefs have been unevenly surveyed, with many areas lacking
   baseline data. In this study, the current status of Orbicella reefs, a
   structurally complex forereef habitat, was quantified in an understudied
   region, the Eastern Caribbean. During 2011 the same observers surveyed
   benthic assemblages, coral juvenile density, herbivorous fishes, and
   invertebrates at 30 Orbicella reefs in four Eastern Caribbean areas:
   Antigua, Barbados, St Lucia, and St Vincent and the Grenadines
   (hereafter St Vincent). Not all Orbicella forereefs were functionally
   the same in the Eastern Caribbean. Benthic communities and herbivorous
   fishes varied greatly among islands. Hard coral had the highest overall
   percent cover on most reefs in this study, with an average cover of 22%,
   and was greater than fleshy macroalgal cover at 83% of the sites.
   Overall, coral juvenile density was low but was positively associated
   with higher densities of Diadema antillarum, highlighting the importance
   of herbivory on the reefs. Nearshore coral reefs in Barbados were in a
   better state than other areas, exhibiting higher coral cover dominated
   by spawning corals, higher densities of coral juveniles exhibiting
   higher coral cover dominated by spawning corals, higher densities of
   coral juveniles and D. antillarum. Low biomass of herbivorous fishes at
   a majority of the coral reef sites is of major concern for the
   functioning of these reefs. Conservation of parrotfishes and other
   herbivores is necessary given the abundance of algae on most of these
   reefs and the beneficial effect of their presence on coral juveniles.
   This is the first comprehensive study that compares the state of
   Orbicella reefs in the Eastern Caribbean, providing valuable information
   that will be useful in creating realistic targets for future management
   and conservation.

AB Feral cats are directly responsible for a large percentage of global
   extinctions, particularly on islands. We reviewed feral cat eradication
   programs with the intent of providing information for future island
   conservation actions. Most insular cat introductions date from the
   nineteenth and twentieth centuries, whereas successful eradication
   programs have been carried out in the last 30 years, most in the last
   decade. Globally, feral cats have been removed from at least 48 islands:
   16 in Baja California (Mexico), 10 in New Zealand, 5 in Australia, 4 in
   the Pacific Ocean, 4 in Seychelles, 3 in the sub-Antarctic, 3 in
   Macaronesia (Atlantic Ocean), 2 in Mauritius, and 1 in the Caribbean.
   The majority of these islands (75%; n = 36) are small (less than or
   equal to5 km(2)). The largest successful eradication campaign took place
   on Marion Island (290 km(2)), but cats have been successfully removed
   from only 10 islands (21%) of greater than or equal to 10 km(2). On
   Cousine Island (Seychelles) cat density reached 243 cats/km(2), but on
   most islands densities did not exceed 79.2 cats/km(2) (n = 22; 81%). The
   most common methods in successful eradication programs were trapping and
   hunting (often with dogs; 91% from a total of 43 islands). Frequently,
   these methods were used together. Other methods included poisoning
   (1080; monofluoracetate in fish baits, n = 13; 31%), secondary poisoning
   from poisoned rats (n = 4; 10%), and introduction of viral disease
   (feline panleucopaenia; n = 2; 5%). Impacts from cat predation and, more
   recently, the benefits of cat eradications have been increasingly
   documented. These impacts and benefits, combined with the continued
   success of eradication campaigns on larger islands, show the value and
   role of feral cat eradications in biodiversity conservation. However,
   new and more efficient techniques used in combination with current
   techniques will likely be needed for success on larger islands.

AB Small Island Developing States (SIDS) are now experiencing the local
   consequences of a changing climate, environment, and society.
   Nonetheless, climate change research frequently remains at regional or
   national levels. Without locally grounded data, islanders' perceived
   impacts of the changes might not be considered, thereby causing
   difficulties when policy and practice responses are implemented without
   accounting for local understandings. To contribute to addressing this
   gap, this study examines perceptions of climate change and associated
   environmental and social changes in two SIDS case studies: St. Kitts in
   the Caribbean Sea and Male Atoll, Maldives in the Indian Ocean. Through
   these two case studies, we assess perceptions of changing social and
   natural environments through a closed-question, face-to-face survey. Our
   results suggest that in both island case studies, communities perceive
   environmental changes to be happening that demand negotiation with the
   social changes of daily life. Results also suggest that perceived
   climate change impacts are only part of the equation, as social and
   economic impacts reveal two case studies of changing island societies.
   While the geographic context in each case study differs, this study
   reveals the perceived impacts of climate change and social changes at a
   local level, providing valuable insights and angles for formulating
   policies and actions to deal with the myriad of social and environmental
   changes affecting SIDS.

AB A survey was made of the status of stocks of groupers and hinds (Family
   Serranidae) in the northeastern Caribbean, principally in January and
   February 2003, coinciding with the principal spawning season of most
   species. The study area ranged from the U.S. Virgin Islands in the west
   to Antigua-Barbuda in the south-east and was based on interviews and
   correspondence with fishers, fisheries officers and other knowledgeable
   individuals and catches observed at fishing ports and landing sites.
   Supplementary information included previous personal observations and
   unpublished notes. The survey revealed that stocks of the red hind,
   Epinephelus guttatus, appeared to be in relatively good condition in
   most areas and many spawning aggregation sites are known and are
   targeted by fishers. However, stocks of the larger groupers have been
   greatly reduced and spawning aggregations of the Nassau grouper, E.
   striatus, are now known only from the British Virgin Islands and the
   Antigua-Barbuda shelf. The other species of large groupers are seldom
   landed and form an insignificant part of the total reef fish catch in
   most areas. Areas that are known to be ciguatoxic provide some degree of
   protection from fishing, and marine protected areas provide partial
   refuges, although the seaward boundaries are not in sufficiently deep
   water to protect groupers throughout their lives. The relative economic
   status of fishers also affects grouper stocks. In countries with
   relatively small human populations and good spiny lobster stocks the
   fishers target lobsters with special traps that have entrances that are
   made sufficiently small to exclude large predatory groupers. Recovery of
   depleted stocks of serranids will depend on known spawning aggregation
   sites being permanently closed to fishing and the development of
   effective marine protected areas that cover the known depth range of all
   species; effectively from the shoreline to 400 m.

AB Traditional ecological knowledge (TEK) represents multiple bodies of
   knowledge accumulated through many generations of close interactions
   between people and the natural world. TEK and its application via
   customary ecological management plans can be useful in modern
   conservation programs. I disaggregate the term TEK into its constituent
   parts and show several ways in which TEK can strengthen research designs
   by increasing locality-specific knowledge, including environmental
   linkages occurring in those localities. Examples of the uses of TEK in
   conservation include folk taxonomy in systematics in Micronesia, species
   knowledge for conservation in Kiribati, and fishers' knowledge of
   ecological interactions for reserve design in Belize. When
   conservationists recognize the utility of TEK, they can engage in an
   equitable exchange of knowledge and foster shared responsibility with
   indigenous people. These types of exchanges can also provide an
   opportunity for indigenous people to develop a scientific
   infrastructure.

AB In recent years the region of the Americas has experienced increasing
   dengue activity with circulation of multiple virus serotypes. Associated
   with this trend has been the occurrence of sporadic dengue hemorrhagic
   fever (DHF) cases and of DHF epidemics in both the Caribbean and Latin

   countries in the Caribbean conduct national Aedes aegypti control
   programs and despite the fact that in some instances, expenditures
   exceed US$5 per capita per annum. This paper critically reviews the
   resources and vector control strategies employed in the region and in
   selected neighboring countries. Reasons for the lack of progress include
   continued overreliance on eradication-style larviciding routines and the
   passive role of communities in addressing the problem. A policy of
   health promotion aimed at improving environmental health practices at
   the household and community levels has been endorsed by the governments
   of the region but as yet has not been widely adopted.

   has been associated with civil unrest, unemployment, crime, poverty,

   inequality), inadequate formal housing provision, the rise of the
   informal sector (and repressions of it), pressures on education,
   housing, health and other services such as water and garbage disposal,
   rather than with sustained economic growth. Such wide-ranging issues
   have posed problems where economic growth is static, structures of urban
   governance are lacking or weak (or corrupt), land disputes are frequent
   and urban populations increasingly permanent. Urban development
   necessitates balanced regional development and sustainable urbanisation

AB A brief description is given of the background behind the Small Island
   States Global Conference scheduled for March 1994.  Preliminary meetings
   led to the formation of a draft program of action pertaining to climatic
   change and sea level increases, natural and environmental disasters,
   freshwater resources, management of wastes, coastal and marine
   resources, land and energy resources, tourism and biodiversity
   resources, regional institutions and technical cooperation, and a
   variety of other topics.  Little agreement was reached on
   implementation, monitoring, and review among member states, which called
   for additional meetings.  The World Coast Conference, held in November
   1993, focused on progressive sustainable development and integrated
   coastal zone management (ICZM).  Participants agreed on the necessity to
   1) strengthen state's capabilities for ICZM, 2)  identify priorities, 3)
   set up comprehensive and flexible assessment mechanisms, 4) coordinate
   activities at all levels, and 5) address longterm concerns.  Only two
   nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) sent reports on donor activities. 
   Host country meetings were held in Barbados in preparation for the
   planned 1994 Conference and settlement of logistics.  CNN will provide
   television coverage of the Conference and produce documentaries on small
   island states.  General Assembly highlights included summary statements
   by Belgium, Vanuatu, Maldives, the Caribbean community, Korea, and
   Australia members.  The Barbados Declaration, which is in process and
   will be adopted in some form at the 1994 Conference, may incorporate
   elements from the Rio Declaration on Environment and Development.  The
   Ecojournalism workshop scheduled for Jamaica in January 1994 is aiming
   to instill awareness of the 1994 Conference and small island issues. 
   157 NGOs have received accreditation for the 1994 Conference, of which
   50 are from small island states, 50 from developed countries, and 53
   from nonisland developing countries.  The NGO Liaison Committee will
   focus on workshops on special issues, examples of sustainable
   development such as the Village of Hope, and a showcase of affordable
   technologies and services in order to achieve more sustainable patterns
   of development.

AB An analytical model of the mean wind-driven circulation of the North
   Atlantic and Caribbean Sea is constructed based on linear dynamics and
   assumed existence of a level of no motion above all topography. The
   circulation around each island is calculated using the island rule,
   which is extended to describe an arbitrary length chain of overlapping
   islands. Frictional effects in the intervening straits are included by
   assuming a linear dependence on strait transport. Asymptotic expansions
   in the limit of strong and weak friction show that the transport
   streamfunction on an island boundary is dependent on wind stress over
   latitudes spanning the whole length of the island chain and spanning
   just immediately adjacent islands, respectively. The powerfulness of the
   method in enabling the wind stress bands, which determine a particular
   strait transport, to be readily identified, is demonstrated by a brief
   explanation of transport similarities and differences in earlier
   numerical models forced by various climatological wind stress products.
   In the absence of frictional effects outside western boundary layers,
   some weaker strait transports are in the wrong direction (e. g.,
   Santaren Channel) and others are too large (e. g., Old Bahama Channel).
   Also, there is no western boundary current to the east of Abaco Island.
   Including frictional effects in the straits enables many of these
   discrepancies to be resolved. Sensitivity in strait transport to
   friction parameter is explored for the Caribbean island chain. Transport
   reversal in the minor passages around the Bahama Banks and Windward
   Passage as the friction parameter increased is noted. The separation
   latitude of the western boundary currents on Cuba's east coast moves
   southward as the friction parameter increases from zero, so making the
   Great Inagua Passage transport a better proxy for the Windward Passage
   transport. Major discrepancies with observations, namely, eastward
   instead of westward flow in Grenada Passage, a southward instead of
   northward Guyana Current, and hence a Caribbean circulation and Florida
   Current fed wholly by water masses of North Atlantic origin, cannot be
   resolved. However, they are simply overcome by extending the model to
   three layers with the wind-driven and upper limb of the thermohaline
   circulation confined to the top layer, and the lower limb of the
   thermohaline circulation to the bottom layer. If it is assumed that over
   the latitudes of the Caribbean there is no significant
   upwelling/downwelling between the layers, then the thermohaline-driven
   circulation is effectively a western boundary current, and all of the
   results for the analytical wind-driven- only model carry over, but with
   the value of the upper-layer transport streamfunction on the boundary of
   the American continent set to the magnitude of the thermohaline
   circulation rather than that on Africa. Exploration of strait transport
   sensitivity to friction parameter gives that realistic transports
   through the passages of the Windward Islands are only obtained if the
   friction coefficient in these passages is an order of magnitude larger
   than that in the western passages. Windward Passage transport reverses
   from south to north for a smaller value of the friction parameter than
   in the absence of the thermohaline circulation; Anegada and Mona
   Passages are robust inflow passages for the Caribbean Sea. South
   Atlantic water masses enter the Caribbean Sea through the passages from
   Grenada Passage to Martinique Passage. As the friction coefficient in
   the Windward Islands passages increases from zero, South Atlantic water
   mass is partially deflected northward along the outer arc of the islands
   and enters the Caribbean Sea through the passages up to Anegada Passage.
   The model suggests that for realistic friction parameters, South
   Atlantic water masses are unlikely to be found in the more western
   passages, or in the western boundary current skirting the edge of the
   Bahama Banks.

AB Water striders or pond skaters belonging to the subfamily Gerrinae are
   common inhabitants of various types of fresh water throughout eastern
   and northern Australia. The present paper deals with the 13 species (in
   5 genera) known from Australia. Redescriptions or descriptive notes,
   illustrations, and keys to adults and nymphs of all species are provided
   and their distributions recorded and mapped. Tenagogerris pallidus and
   T. femoratus (both from Northern Territory and Western Australia),
   Tenagogonus australiensis (Queensland), Limnometra ciliodes (Queensland,
   Papua New Guinea and Irian Jaya), and Limnogonus fossarum gilguy
   (Northern Territory, Queensland, South Australia, Western Australia,
   Indo-Malayan Archipelago, and West Pacific to Samoa and Tonga) are
   described as new. Limnometra poliakanthina Nieser & Chen is synonymised
   with L. cursitans (Fabricius) and Hydrometra australis Skuse (=
   Limnometra skusei Torre-Bueno) with Limnogonus luctuosus (Montrouzier).
   The evolution and zoogeography of Australian water striders are
   discussed. Finally, we discuss the ecology of the gerrine water striders
   of Australia in relation to our present knowledge about habitats,
   phenology, wing polymorphism, and association between species.

AB This study compares how four Caribbean small islandsAruba, the Dominican
   Republic, Jamaica, and Martiniqueuse their authentic cuisines to promote
   their destinations. Brochures, catalogs, websites, and other promotional
   materials for each destination were content analyzed. Although all four
   destinations seem to use their authentic cuisines for tourism promotion,
   key differences exist among these islands in their marketing and
   promotional strategies. Martinique appears to use its local cuisine most
   aggressively, using a combination of locally prepared foods, cocktails,
   rum, fruits, and vegetables to visually portray this aspect of the
   country's heritage. Jamaica, in contrast, uses mainly fruit and
   vegetable imagery. The study findings suggest a need for these four
   Caribbean island destinations to develop expertise in culinary tourism,
   followed by promotion through brochures, catalogs, websites, and other
   marketing materials.

AB Caribbean Small Island Developing States (SIDS) are vulnerable to
   climate change impacts including sea level rise, invasive species, ocean
   acidification, changes in rainfall patterns, increased temperatures, and
   changing hazard regimes including hurricanes, floods and drought. Given
   high dependencies in Caribbean SIDS on natural resources for
   livelihoods, a focus on ecosystems and their interaction with people is
   essential for climate change adaptation. Increasingly, ecosystem-based
   adaptation (EbA) approaches are being highlighted as an approach to
   address climate change impacts. Specifically, EbA encourages the use of
   local and external knowledge about ecosystems to identify climate change
   adaptation approaches. This paper critically reviews EbA in Caribbean
   SIDS, focusing on the need to integrate local and external knowledge. An
   analysis of current EbA in the Caribbean is undertaken alongside a
   review of methodologies used to integrate local and external expertise
   for EbA. Finally key gaps, lessons learnt and suggested ways forward for
   EbA in Caribbean SIDS and potentially further afield are identified.

AB Data presented herein provide records of four species of bats new to the
   fauna of the Antillean island of Saba -Monophyllusplethodon, Ardops
   nichollsi, Tadarida brasiliensis, and Molossus molossus. Together with
   three species previously recorded from the island - Brachyphylla
   covernarum, Artibeus jamaicensis, and Natolus stramineus - the
   chiropteran fauna of the island is documented to be composed of seven
   species. Our analysis of species/area relationships for West Indian bats
   provides a slope value of z = 0. 177 and R(2) = 0.76; therefore, the bat
   fauna of the West Indies has the flattest slope for this relationship of
   any West Indian group. This relationship is best explained by a
   propensity for over water dispersal by West Indian bats. We propose to
   unite the chiropteran faunas of the islands of Anguilla, Antigua,
   Barbuda, Nevis, Saba, St. Barthelemy, St. Eustatius, St. Kitts, and St.
   Martin by recognizing them as the Northern Antillean Faunal Area. Given
   the small size of Saba (12 km(2)) and the even smaller effective habitat
   for non-molossid bats (4 km(2)), conservation concerns are expressed for
   the future of the fauna and some recommendations are made for its
   preservation.

AB Small Island Developing States (SIDS) have established ambitious
   renewable energy targets. The promotion of renewable energy has been
   motivated by several factors: a desire to lessen dependence on fossil
   fuels, to attract development assistance in the energy sector, and to
   strengthen the position of SIDS in climate change negotiations. Here we
   explore the interplay between the role of aid and energy policy in the
   development of renewable energy resources in SIDS. We find that the
   importance of development assistance has implications for the
   sustainability of renewable energy development, given that funding is
   not always accompanied by necessary energy policy reforms. We also
   identify energy efficiency and access to modern energy services as
   having received insufficient attention in the establishment and
   structure of renewable energy targets in SIDS, and argue that this is
   problematic due to the strong economic case for such investments. (C)

   macroeconomic and sectoral impacts of various developments in its
   agricultural and resource sector. It was found that commodity booms from
   2004 to 2009 and the proposed large liquefied natural gas project
   increase output growth substantially but with Dutch disease
   consequences. The output expansion of the agricultural and fishery
   sectors on the other hand has limited positive impacts and the challenge
   lies in raising the productivity growth in these sectors and the better
   use of foreign aid. Lastly, the optimal policy strategy for sustainable
   development in the agricultural, fishery and resource sectors lies in
   the packaging of appropriate complementary policies (both institutional
   and economic) that support one another and the coherent implementation
   of these policies in a timely manner.

AB Ascidians from the outer slope and bathyal western Pacific. The
   specimens collected during several recent oceanographic cruises in the
   tropical western Pacific, sponsored jointly by the MNHN and the IRD,
   consist of 53 ascidian species, and among them 16 new species. For
   others, the geographic distribution is increased in the western Pacific.
   The remarkably high diversity of these organisms between 50 and 1000 in
   in this part of the world is demonstrated. In all oceans at these depths
   the ascidian fauna is dominated by solitary organisms, whereas along the
   littoral fringe the majority of ascidian species are colonial. This
   systematic pattern is likely to be influenced by substrate: hard
   nearshore and soft offshore. In this study, among the new species, the
   solitary ascidians largely dominate, especially well represented by
   stolidobranchs with eight Styelidae of four genera, four Pyuridae with
   also four genera, and one Molgulidae. However the originality of this
   deep fauna is enhanced by the presence, in the typical Octacnemidae
   family, of a new genus Myopegma n. gen. with a very small species M.
   melanesium n. gen., n. sp. which has a very peculiar musculature
   justifying a new taxon.

AB 1. Determining large-scale distribution patterns for mosquitoes could
   advance knowledge of global mosquito biogeography and inform decisions
   about where mosquito inventory needs are greatest.
   2. Over 43 000 georeferenced records are presented of identified and
   vouchered mosquitoes from collections undertaken between 1899 and 1982,
   from 1853 locations in 42 countries throughout the Neotropics. Of 492
   species in the data set, 23% were only recorded from one location, and
   Anopheles albimanus Wiedemann is the most common species.
   3. A linear log-log species-area relationship was found for mosquito
   species number and country area. Chile had the lowest relative density
   of species and Trinidad-Tobago the highest, followed by Panama and
   French Guiana.
   4. The potential distribution of species was predicted using an
   Ecological Niche Modelling (ENM) approach. Anopheles species had the
   largest predicted species ranges, whereas species of Deinocerites and
   Wyeomyia had the smallest.
   5. Species richness was estimated for 1 degrees grids and by summing
   predicted presence of species from ENM. These methods both showed areas
   of high species richness in French Guiana, Panama, Trinidad-Tobago, and
   Colombia. Potential hotspots in endemicity included unsampled areas in
   Panama, French Guiana, Colombia, Belize, Venezuela, and Brazil.
   6. Argentina, The Bahamas, Bermuda, Bolivia, Cuba, and Peru were the
   most under-represented countries in the database compared with known
   country species occurrence data. Analysis of species accumulation curves

AB In the Pacific islands, subsistence diversity made possible continuous
   production of food while well-developed exchange networks redistributed
   these foodstuffs as well as items within the prestige economy. All these
   were aspects of the 'storage structures' that enabled social and
   nutritional value to be saved, accumulated and later mobilised. In
   addition, there were investments in the land, landesque capital, which
   secured future food surpluses and so provided an alternative to food
   storage, in a region where the staple foods were mostly perishable, yams
   excepted, and food preservation was difficult. Landesque capital
   included such long-term improvements to productivity as terraces,
   mounds, irrigation channels, drainage ditches, soil structural changes
   and tree planting. These investments provided an effective alternative
   to food storage and made possible surplus production for exchange
   purposes. As an example, in the New Georgia group of the western Solomon
   Islands irrigated terraces, termed ruta, were constructed for growing
   the root crop taro (Colocasia esculenta). Surplus taro from ruta enabled
   inland groups to participate in regional exchange networks and so obtain
   the shell valuables that were produced by coastal groups. In this paper,
   we reconstruct how this exchange system worked in New Georgia using
   ethno-archaeological evidence, we chart its prehistoric rise and
   post-colonial fall, and we outline the factors that constrained its
   long-term expansion.

AB Background: Zinc deficiency affects multiple vital functions in the life
   cycle, especially growth. Limited information is available on the
   magnitude of zinc deficiency in Latin America and the Caribbean.
   Objective: To examine the latest available information on both the
   prevalence of zinc deficiency and the risk of zinc deficiency in Latin
   America and the Caribbean.
   Methods: The prevalence of zinc deficiency was identified through a
   systematic review looking for the latest available data on serum zinc
   concentrations from surveys or studies with national representativeness
   conducted in Latin America and the Caribbean. The risk of zinc
   deficiency in Latin America and the Caribbean was estimated based on
   dietary zinc inadequacy (according to the 2011 National Food Balance
   Sheets) and stunting in children under 5 years of age.
   Results: Only four countries had available national biochemical data.
   Mexican, Colombian, Ecuadorian, and Guatemalan children under 6 years of
   age and women 12 to 49 years of age had a high prevalence of zinc
   deficiency (19.1% to 56.3%). The countries with the highest risk of zinc
   deficiency (estimated prevalence of inadequate zinc intake >25% plus
   prevalence of stunting >20%) were Belize, Bolivia, El Salvador,
   Guatemala, Haiti, Honduras, Nicaragua, and Saint Vincent and the
   Grenadines. Zinc dietary inadequacy was directly correlated with
   stunting (r = 0.64, p < .001).
   Conclusions: Prevalence data from the four available Latin America and
   Caribbean national surveys indicate a high prevalence of zinc deficiency
   in children under 6 years of age and women 12 to 49 years of age. High
   rates of both estimated zinc dietary inadequacy and stunting were also
   reported in most Latin America and Caribbean countries.

AB Trinidad and Tobago was the last Caribbean island to be invaded by the
   lionfish and since its invasion in 2012 they have spread to most coral
   reef and hard bottom environments. Standard reef fish surveys were used
   to assess lionfish population densities and size distributions from
   2013-2015. Total lengths ranged between 6.2-40.4 cm and 22-950 gin
   weight The length-weight relationship was described by W = 0.0002
   L-2.5654. Fish densities were highest in the northeast Tobago at 326
   lionfish/ha and the lowest in the southwest Tobago at 10.5 lionfish/ha.
   In order to curtail the spread of this invasive species, a culling
   programme was initiated at selected reefs to regularly remove lionfish
   at monthly intervals. On the selected reefs 26-30% reduction in mean
   lionfish biomass and 25-27% reduction in abundance was noted compared to
   control sites (p < 0.05). (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

   small Pacific Island nations, Fiji and Papua New Guinea are involved in
   sugar production. In Fiji, the sugar industry has an important role to
   play in rural development, however, the industry must adjust to changes
   in the international trading market. This includes the cultivars of
   sugarcane cultivated to increase the level of production and to
   implement appropriate solutions for the native land tenure system to
   facilitate increases in farm production. As the sugar industry in Fiji
   is vertically integrated, there is the need for an approach that is well
   coordinated to implement the new and redesigned policies.

AB Fisheries usually first remove large predators before switching to
   smaller species, causing lasting changes to fish community structure.
   Reef fish provide essential protein and income for many people, and the
   impacts of commercial and high-intensity subsistence fishing on reef
   fish are well documented. However, how fish communities respond to low
   levels of subsistence fishing using traditional techniques (fishing for
   food, few fishers) is less well understood. We use three atolls in the
   Marshall Islands as a model system to quantify effects of commercial and
   subsistence fishing on reef fish communities, compared to a
   near-pristine baseline. Unexpectedly, fish biomass was highest on the
   commercially-fished atoll where the assemblage was dominated by
   herbivores (50% higher than other atolls) and contained few top
   predators (70% lower than other atolls). By contrast, fish biomass and
   trophic composition did not differ between pristine and
   subsistence-fished atolls - top predators were abundant on both. We show
   that in some cases, reefs can support fishing by small communities to
   provide food but still retain intact fish assemblages. Low-intensity
   subsistence fishing may not always harm marine food webs, and we suggest
   that its effects depend on the style and intensity of fishing practised
   and the type of organisms targeted.

AB The inshore fisheries resource is important to the health and culture of
   many of the inhabitants of Pacific Island countries (PIC). Ciguateric
   fishes (mainly demersal reef fishes) cause a range of distressing and
   often debilitating gastrointestinal neurological and cardiovascular
   disturbances. Consequently, ciguatera limits the utilisation of this
   otherwise over-exploited resource. For many victims, the symptoms
   suffered during the chronic phase of ciguatera (lasting weeks, months
   and occasionally years) are exacerbated upon consumption of certain
   foods, particularly non-toxic fishes. After each outbreak, victims and
   members of their social-network experience a transient increase in
   perception of the risk of eating reef fish. The impact of ciguatera is
   greatest in atoll island countries where fish is the primary source of
   protein (it also has a major impact and to facilitate the management of
   ciguatera in PIC, regular information is required that quantifies: (i)
   the true incidence of ciguatera; (ii) the extent and way in which
   different communities avoid ciguatera; and (iii) the adverse impact
   ciguatera has on health, the workforce, trade and tourism. Over the last
   15 years (based on SPEHIS data to 1990), some countries recorded a
   decrease in the ciguatera problem (New Caledonia, Marshall Is.), other
   countries an increase (Kirbati, Tuvalu, French Polynesia), while still
   other countries recorded an increase followed by a decrease in ciguatera
   (Tokelau, American Samoa, Western Samoa, Fiji and Vanuatu). There may
   also be seasonal trends in the incidence of ciguatera in some countries
   e.g. Fiji. Management options presently implementable in PIC include:
   (i) treatment with i.v. mannitol; (ii) provision of timely advise on the
   location and status of ciguatera "hot spots" in each country that would
   allow affected communities to react objectively to the risk posed by
   ciguatera; and (iii) modification of human behaviour and aspirations to
   reduce the impact of increasing population, pollution and development
   (e.g. causeways) pressures.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

   and one Neritina species, which are present in the Solomon Islands and

   Septaria bougainvillei and Clithon pritchardi, which are present on the

AB The development of high value crops for domestic consumption and export
   is considered a priority for economic development and improved
   livelihoods for many Pacific Island countries. However, attempts to
   intensify production without adequate attention to research and
   development in areas such as identification of well-adapted cultivars
   may lead to gains being limited and short-lived. The Australian Centre
   for International Agricultural Research project "Strengthening
   integrated crop management research in the Pacific Islands in support of
   sustainable intensification of high value crop production" aims to build
   and sustain capacity to develop integrated crop management strategies
   for the sustainable intensification of high value crop production for
   export and domestic markets. Activities include the introduction and
   evaluation of performance of improved solanaceous cultivars in each
   target country, and the testing of integrated technologies for their
   efficacy to increase and extend vegetable production seasons. Tomato is
   a high-value crop in Fiji and the Solomon Islands. It is commonly grown
   by farmers for household consumption and the domestic market. Eleven
   improved open pollinated tomato cultivars sourced from the World
   Vegetable Center in Taiwan were evaluated over three cropping seasons.
   Three cultivars ('CLN3150A-5', 'CLN2585D' and 'CLN2071D') were selected
   and officially released in Fiji and the Solomon Islands. The released
   cultivars now locally known as 'Melrose' and 'Rio Gold' in Fiji, and
   'Rose's Choice' in the Solomon Islands, performed well under local
   growing conditions and are high yielding, producing well-shaped fruit
   with a taste preferred by local consumers. For farmers, these new open
   pollinated cultivars provide an opportunity to produce for the local
   market and also to save their own seeds for small-scale planting. This
   was a milestone achievement for project partners - local agriculture
   ministries, the Pacific Community, the University of Queensland, and the
   World Vegetable Center.

AB The description of Culicoides paragarciai sp.n. from New Guinea is based
   on three female specimens, one of which was originally misidentified as
   C. purus Lee and Reye. The new species belongs in the Ornatus Group and
   is morphologically very similar to C. garciai Wirth and Hubert that was
   observed feeding on mud-skipper fish on the Malay Peninsula. Comparative
   numerical data and illustrations are presented as a basis for the
   differentiation of C. paragarciai, C. garciai and C. purus and the
   possibility is discussed that C. paragarciai may also feed on
   mudskippers that are abundant in mangrove habitats of New Guinea and the
   Australian tropics.

AB Using partial sequences of two mitochondrial genes, cytochrome c oxidase
   subunit I (COI) and 12S ribosomal RNA (12S rRNA), and one nuclear gene,
   28S ribosomal RNA (28S rRNA), we investigated population genetics of the
   holoplanktonic shrimp Lucifer hanseni Nobili, 1905 in the Indo-Malayan
   Archipelago (IMA), encompassing Andaman Sea, Malacca Strait, Gulf of
   Thailand, Borneo Island, Philippines (hereafter collectively referred to
   as the Thailand-Malaysia-Philippine area: TMP), Celebes Sea (CS), and
   the waters near islands in the Western Pacific (WP) including Palau,
   Papua New Guinea and Solomon Islands. The samples from the TMP showed
   the highest number of haplotypes. Significant phylogeographic structure
   was found in the L. hanseni populations (phi(ST) = 0.832 for COI, 0.159
   for 12S rRNA, 0.783 for 28S rRNA). The total number of haplotypes was 46
   in COI, 28 in 12S rRNA and 23 in 28S rRNA. The haplotype network
   analyses revealed two major clades for COI (subgroups: TMP + CS, WP) and
   for 12S rRNA and 28S rRNA (TMP, CS + WP). The CS and WP populations
   appeared isolated from the TMP populations. The samples from the CS
   showed low genetic diversity compared with the other samples at both
   haplotype and nucleotide levels, suggesting that the population CS
   experienced bottleneck events. This is the first demonstration of
   significant genetic structure of a holoplanktonic metazoan in IMA, which
   is suggested to be synergistically influenced by historical events
   (vicariance) and contemporary oceanographic circulations and
   corroborates the results of previous studies on other benthic/demersal
   animals with mero-planktonic phases.

AB Pacific Island Countries (PICs) lag behind global trends in water,
   sanitation and hygiene (WaSH) development. We conducted a systematic
   search of all English language papers (published before February 2015)
   about WaSH in PICs to evaluate the state of the peer-reviewed literature
   and explore thematic findings. A total of 121 papers met the criteria
   for full-text review following an initial search result of more than
   6,000 papers. Two reviewers independently assessed the quality and
   relevance of each article and consolidated their findings according to
   four emergent themes: public health, environment, emergency response and
   interventions, and management and governance. Findings indicate a
   knowledge gap in evidence-guided WaSH management strategies that
   advocate for human health while concurrently protecting and preserving
   drinking water resources. Extreme weather events threaten the quantity
   and quality of limited freshwater resources, and cultural factors that
   are unique to PICs present challenges to hygiene and sanitation. This
   review highlights the strengths and weaknesses of the peer-reviewed
   literature on WaSH in PICs, addresses spatial and temporal publication
   trends, and suggests areas in need of further research to help PICs meet
   development goals.

AB Aim To determine if habitat diversity, as estimated by climatic and
   topographic variables, can predict patterns of orchid diversity on
   different islands and archipelagos with similar explanatory power to
   biogeographical variables, such as area, isolation and age of an island.
   Location Sixty-three islands on eight archipelagos ( Solomon Islands,
   Vanuatu, New Caledonia, Fiji, Samoa, Tonga, Niue and the Cook Islands)
   in the southwest Pacific.
   Methods For each island, we determined the orchid species present, age,
   area, isolation, and indicators of topographic heterogeneity and
   climatic variability. We then determined the power of various
   biogeographical, climatic and topographic variables to predict the
   number of indigenous and endemic species on archipelagos, and on islands
   within archipelagos, using generalized linear models ( GLMs) and
   generalized linear mixed models ( GLMMs) respectively.
   Results We identified a total of 552 species in 110 genera. Area was the
   only significant biogeographical variable for predicting patterns of
   orchid species diversity on archipelagos and islands. However, climatic
   and topographic predictors of habitat diversity performed similarly
   well. The range in curvature was the best indicator of species richness
   from the topographic variables, while the range of temperature was the
   best climatic predictor. These key variables were often strongly
   correlated with area.
   Main conclusions Climatic and topographic variables are useful
   indicators of habitat diversity. The high explanatory power of area and
   climatic and topographic predictors, and the strong correlation among
   these variables, suggests that increasing habitat diversity with
   increasing area may be the major driver of the species-area
   relationship. Using climatic and topographic variables as predictors of
   species richness therefore allows determining the key environmental
   factors and processes driving species diversity.

AB The unusual bathyal comatulid crinoid genus Atelecrinus is widespread in
   the Atlantic and tropical Pacific Oceans and currently includes three
   recognized species. A re-assessment based on examination of new and
   existing specimens requires establishment of two new genera and five new
   species, and returns three junior synonyms to species-level status.
   Paratelecrinus is erected to accommodate Atelecrinus wyvilli PH
   Carpenter, A. conifer AH Clark, A. cubensis PH Carpenter, P.
   orthotriremis, new species, P. amenouzume new species, P. laticonulus
   new species and P. telo new species. Adelatelecrinus is erected to
   accommodate Atelecrinus sulcatus AH Clark and Adelatelecrinus vallatus
   new species. Atelecrinus retains A. balanoides PH Carpenter and A.
   helgae AH Clark, which restricts the genus to the Atlantic. In both
   Paratelecrinus and Adelatelecrinus, the basals articulate with the
   centrodorsal via ligament bundles anchored in deep ring-like interradial
   pits that project into the centrodorsal cavity, whereas in Atelecrinus
   the centrodorsal rim has shallow interradial concavities and attaches to
   the basals via a tight junction with no obvious ligament bundles. The
   spoon-shaped aboral fossa in the basals of Paratelecrinus appears to be
   unique among articulate crinoids and differs from the smooth fossa found
   in both Atelecrinus and Adelatelecrinus. New material extends the range
   of the family to the Indian Ocean. A few species are now known from
   enough specimens to identify some ontogenetic and distributional
   variations. Proximal ray morphology varies substantially with size in P.
   cubensis and P. orthotriremis. A. balanoides generally occurs in deeper
   water in the Lesser Antilles than in the Bahamas and Strait of Florida,
   while P. orthotriremis occurs in shallower water in the Lesser Antilles
   and deeper in the Bahamas.

AB Archaeological and molecular data have revealed that the present day
   faunas of many island groups in Melanesia, Polynesia, and Micronesia are
   not representative of the biodiversity generated within this region on
   an evolutionary timescale. Erroneous inferences regarding the mechanisms
   of speciation and the significance of long distance dispersal in shaping
   the present diversity of these island systems have resulted from this
   incomplete diversity and distributional data. The lizard fauna east of
   Samoa has been suggested to derive entirely from human-mediated
   introductions, a distribution congruent with biogeographic patterns for
   other Pacific species. Distinguishing between introduced populations and
   those that result from natural colonization events is difficult,
   although molecular data provide a useful means for elucidating
   population history and identifying the likely sources of introductions.
   We use molecular data (1726 bp of mitochondrial DNA and 286 bp of
   nuclear DNA) to evaluate a population of arboreal lizards from the Cook
   Islands and to determine whether this arboreal skink population is the
   sole endemic component of the lizard fauna east of Samoa or the result
   of human-mediated introduction. (C) 2010 The Linnean Society of London,

AB The fisheries sectors in Vanuatu and Timor-Leste are important sources
   of food and income. Similar to other developing countries and those in
   the Pacific, they are vulnerable to the impacts of climate change more
   so because of their geographic location, socioeconomic conditions and
   political instability. Nonetheless, there are approaches to alleviate
   the damaging effects of climate change in the region's fisheries sector.
   Using economic modeling, this paper estimates the economic costs of
   potential climate change adaptation strategies for the fisheries sector
   in Vanuatu and Timor-Leste through assessment of alternative future
   scenarios. Strategies include aquaculture development, natural resource
   management through establishment and/or expansion of marine protected
   areas, and deployment of low-cost inshore fish aggregating devices.
   Modeling results demonstrate that the above innovations will enable the
   two countries to significantly improve coastal and freshwater fish
   production in the medium-term (2035) and long-term (2050). Fish
   consumption is projected to grow due to population and income
   improvements; yet considerable increases in production will augment
   demand. Furthermore, national-level gains are projected from these
   adaptation strategies through fish exports. Improved production under
   climate change will require significant investments from the national
   governments of Vanuatu and Timor-Leste and/or private sectors. (C) 2015

AB In 2010, severe coral bleaching was observed across the southeastern
   Caribbean, including the island of Tobago, where coral reefs are subject
   to sedimentation and high nutrient levels from terrestrial runoff. Here
   we examine changes in corals' colony size distributions over time
   (2010-2013), juvenile abundances and sedimentation rates for sites
   across Tobago following the 2010 bleaching event. The results indicated
   that since pre-bleaching coral cover was already low due to local
   factors and past disturbance, the 2010 event affected only particular
   susceptible species' population size structure and increased the
   proportion of small sized colonies. The low density of juveniles (mean
   of 5.4 +/- 63 juveniles/m(-2)) suggests that Tobago's reefs already
   experienced limited recruitment, especially of large broadcasting
   species. The juvenile distribution and the response of individual
   species to the bleaching event support the notion that Caribbean reefs
   are becoming dominated by weedy non-framework building taxa which are
   more resilient to disturbances. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

AB The deep-sea part of the 'Papua Niugini Biodiversity Expedition'
   surveyed the deep-sea environments along the coasts of New Guinea Island
   in the Bismarck Sea, from the Vitiaz Strait to the border between Papua
   New Guinea (PNG) and Irian Jaya. This expedition was a follow-up of the
   BIOPAPUA cruise (2010) that gave some of the first insights into the
   diversity of the deep-sea fauna of the Bismarck and Solomon Seas for
   environments other than deep-sea hydrothermal vents. The main aims of
   the cruise were to survey the diversity of the fauna of (i) hard bottoms
   that are typically found on deep seamounts, (ii) Astrolabe Bay from 200
   m to about 1000 m, (iii) the chemosynthetic environments of the deep
   sea, including cold-seep environments and plant debris. Astrolabe Bay
   was one of our targets because its topography allows sampling over the
   complete bathymetric gradient covered by our sampling gear (down to 1000
   m depth), and the recent start of nickel refining activities in the bay
   is a potential threat to its marine fauna for which little reference
   data are available. Sampling in the bay revealed not only a diversified
   fauna associated with soft bottoms and plant debris, but also a
   chemosynthetic fauna typical of cold-seep environments (e.g. siboglinid
   worms and bathymodioline mussels) below the Ramu refinery. Although the
   refinery activities had officially started just one week before our work
   in the area, we observed impacts of these activities. Our molecular work
   indicates that the siboglinid tubeworm species and one of the two mussel
   species collected below the Ramu refinery have so far only been
   documented from this location, despite intensive sampling effort. This
   illustrates the potential destructive effects of human activities in
   areas where the diversity and uniqueness of deep-sea communities are
   poorly understood.

AB Background and Aims The biodiversity hotspot of New Caledonia is
   globally renowned for the diversity and endemism of its flora. New
   Caledonia's tropical rainforests have been reported to have higher stem
   densities, higher concentrations of relictual lineages and higher
   endemism than other rainforests. This study investigates whether these
   aspects differ in New Caledonian rainforests compared to other
   high-diversity rainforests in the Southwest Pacific.
   Methods Plants (with a diameter at breast height >= 10 cm) were surveyed
   in nine 1-ha rainforest plots across the main island of New Caledonia
   and compared with 14 1-ha plots in high-diversity rainforests of the
   Southwest Pacific (in Australia, Fiji, Papua New Guinea and the Solomon
   Islands). This facilitated a comparison of stem densities, taxonomic
   composition and diversity, and species turnover among plots and
   countries.
   Key Results The study inventoried 11 280 stems belonging to 335 species
   (93 species ha(-1) on average) in New Caledonia. In comparison with
   other rainforests in the Southwest Pacific, New Caledonian rainforests
   exhibited higher stem density (1253 stems ha(-1) on average) including
   abundant palms and tree ferns, with the high abundance of the latter
   being unparalleled outside New Caledonia. In all plots, the density of
   relictual species was >= 10 % for both stems and species, with no
   discernible differences among countries. Species endemism, reaching 89 %
   on average, was significantly higher in New Caledonia. Overall, species
   turnover increased with geographical distance, but not among New
   Caledonian plots.
   Conclusions High stem density, high endemism and a high abundance of
   tree ferns with stem diameters >= 10 cm are therefore unique
   characteristics of New Caledonian rainforests. High endemism and high
   spatial species turnover imply that the current system consisting of a
   few protected areas is inadequate, and that the spatial distribution of
   plant species needs to be considered to adequately protect the
   exceptional flora of New Caledonian rainforests.

AB Four new stygobitic and troglomorphic cirolanids are described from
   various Parts of the Caribbean. Cirolana (C.) troglexuma n. sp. is
   described from a cave on one of the Exuma Cays, Bahamas; two subgenera
   are recognized in g. Cirolana: sg. Cirolana including troglexuma as only
   presently known stygobitic species, and sg. Anopsilana equally well
   represented by subterranean and by epigean species. Haptolana bowmani n.
   sp. and H. belizana n. sp. inhabit caves of Yucatan and Belize,
   respectively; interestingly, they are both abundantly different from the
   Cuban species of this stygobitic genus, showing more similarity with the
   species from Somalia and W. Australia. Jamaicalana pleoscissa n. g. n.
   sp. was discovered in a cave from Jamaica; the new genus has affinities
   with Anopsilana and Bahalana, but a combination of characters - some of
   them highly original - renders definition of a new genus necessary.
   Bahalana mayana BOWMAN should be removed from that genus, whereas
   Dodecalana yagerae Carpenter is an interesting species of Bahalana.

AB Tailings disposal from the Bougainville Copper Limited open-cut porphyry
   copper mine on Bougainville Island, Papua New Guinea (1972-1989)
   impacted the ichthyofauna of the Jaba River, one of the largest rivers
   on the island. To assess the extent of this impact, comparative
   freshwater ichthyological surveys were conducted in five rivers on the
   island during the period 1975-1988. Fifty-eight fish species were
   recorded, including one introduction, Oreochromis mossambicus. The
   icthyofauna is dominated by euryhaline marine species consistent with
   that of the Australian region, but more depauperate. There are more than
   100 species present on mainland New Guinea that are absent from
   Bougainville streams. Oreochromis mossambicus was the most abundant
   species in the sampled streams, accounting for 45% of the catch. The
   most abundant native fishes were the mainly small Gobiidae and
   Eleotridae. There were few native fish of potential value as food and
   these were restricted to an eleotrid gudgeon (Ophieleotris aporos),
   tarpon (Megalops cyprinoides), eel (Anguilla marmorata), and snappers
   (Lutjanus argentimaculatus and Lutjanus fuscescens). Fish production in
   the rivers is limited by the morphology of the streams and the
   depauperate ichthyofauna. Fish yield from the Jaba River in its
   premining state is estimated to have ranged from 7 to 12 t/yr. The
   population living in the Jaba catchment in 1988 (approximately 4,600
   persons) shared this resource, resulting in an extremely low per-capita
   fish consumption rate of less than 3 kg/yr.

AB The coral reefs of Papua New Guinea are among the most species diverse
   in the world, support an important artisanal fishery, but lack an
   effective national conservation programme. Increased commercialization,
   population growth, promotion of fisheries development projects, and the
   live reef food fish trade are expected to increase demand for the
   country's reef fish. This paper examines how socioeconomic factors
   affect the condition of the artisanal multi-species coral reef fishery
   in six sites in Papua New Guinea. Catch characteristics such as
   diversity, trophic level and body size by landing site were examined
   along a fishing pressure gradient. Both exogenous factors such as
   markets and endogenous factors such as fishing pressure were related to
   the condition of fish catch. In general, the trophic level and lengths
   of fish captured in Papua New Guinea were relatively high, but were
   reduced on reefs with high fishing effort near fish markets. Fisheries
   showed signs of depletion above c. 25 fishing trips per km 2 per day and
   the proximity of markets was a better indicator of overfishing than
   human population size. A cross-scale approach to fisheries management is
   required in Papua New Guinea to coordinate decentralized local
   management, limit the intrusion of extractive enterprises, and develop
   policies that seek to minimize exogenous pressures on marine resources.

AB Background: The threespot damselfish, Stegastes planifrons (Cuvier), is
   important in mediating interactions among corals, algae, and herbivores
   on Caribbean coral reefs. The preferred microhabitat of S. planifrons is
   thickets of the branching staghorn coral Acropora cervicornis. Within
   the past few decades, mass mortality of A. cervicornis from white-band
   disease and other factors has rendered this coral a minor ecological
   component throughout most of its range.
   Methodology/Principal Findings: Survey data from Jamaica (heavily
   fished), Florida and the Bahamas (moderately fished), the Cayman Islands
   (lightly to moderately fished), and Belize (lightly fished) indicate
   that distributional patterns of S. planifrons are positively correlated
   with live coral cover and topographic complexity. Our results suggest
   that species-specific microhabitat preferences and the availability of
   topographically complex microhabitats are more important than the
   abundance of predatory fish as proximal controls on S. planifrons
   distribution and abundance.
   Conclusions/Significance: The loss of the primary microhabitat of S.
   planifrons-A. cervicornis-has forced a shift in the distribution and
   recruitment of these damselfish onto remaining high-structured corals,
   especially the Montastraea annularis species complex, affecting coral
   mortality and algal dynamics throughout the Caribbean.

AB Even as small island developing states (SIDS) like Trinidad and Tobago
   (T&T) increase industrialization and grapple with the challenges of
   increased pollution, few studies provide guidance to policy makers of
   such countries on appropriate policy measures and instruments that can
   be implemented to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions. Here we apply a
   multi-criteria evaluation methodology to ascertain preferences for
   policy measures and instruments in the power generation sector. Four
   broad policy measures and twelve policy instruments are assessed on
   criteria of environmental performance, feasibility of implementation and
   political acceptability. This method proves useful in T&T, since typical
   to many SIDS, the intensive data required by other policy assessment
   methods is unavailable. Results indicate little difference in preference
   among the four policy measures thereby indicating that a multi-pronged
   approach on several policy fronts is required. The most preferred policy
   instruments to operationalize measures included provision of subsidies
   for energy saving technologies, creating an industry wide carbon trading
   scheme and implementing a feed-in tariff to increase the use of
   renewable energy sources. This study therefore provides specific
   insights for policy makers in Trinidad and Tobago while also providing
   power generation sector specific guidance to other rapidly
   industrializing small island developing states. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Aim The goal of our study was to test fundamental predictions of
   biogeographical theories in tropical reef fish assemblages, in
   particular relationships between fish species richness and island area,
   isolation and oceanographic variables (temperature and productivity) in
   the insular Caribbean. These analyses complement an analogous and more
   voluminous body of work from the tropical Indo-Pacific. The Caribbean is
   more limited in area with smaller inter-island distances than the
   Indo-Pacific, providing a unique context to consider fundamental
   processes likely to affect richness patterns of reef fish.
   Location Caribbean Sea.
   Methods We compiled a set of data describing reef-associated fish
   assemblages from 24 island nations across the Caribbean Sea,
   representing a wide range of isolation and varying in land area from 53
   to 110,860 km(2). Regression-based analyses compared the univariate and
   combined effects of island-specific physical predictors on fish species
   richness.
   Results We found that diversity of reef-associated fishes increases
   strongly with increasing island area and with decreasing isolation.
   Richness also increases with increasing nearshore productivity. Analyses
   of various subsets of the entire data set reveal the robustness of the
   richness data and biogeographical patterns.
   Main conclusions Within the relatively small and densely packed
   Caribbean basin, fish species richness fits the classical species-area
   relationship. Richness also was related negatively to isolation,
   suggesting direct effects of dispersal limitation in community assembly.
   Because oceanic productivity was correlated with isolation, however, the
   related effects of system-wide productivity on richness cannot be
   disentangled. These results highlight fundamental mechanisms that
   underlie spatial patterns of biodiversity among Caribbean coral reefs,
   and which are probably also are functioning in the more widespread and
   heterogeneous reefs of the Indo-Pacific.

AB Public health interventions that involve strategies to re-localise food
   fail in part because they pay insufficient attention to the global
   history of industrial food and agriculture. In this paper we use the
   method of comparative ethnography and the concept of structural violence
   to illustrate how historical and geographical patterns related to
   colonialism and industrialisation (e.g. agrarian change, power relations
   and trade dependencies) hinder efforts to address diet-related
   non-communicable diseases on two small islands. We find comparative
   ethnography provides a useful framework for cross-country analysis of
   public health programmes that can complement quantitative analysis. At
   the same time, the concept of structural violence enables us to make
   sense of qualitative material and link the failure of such programmes to
   wider historical and geographical processes. We use ethnographic
   research carried out from April to August 2013 and from June to July
   2014 in Trinidad (with followup online interviews in 2018) and in Nauru
   from February to May 2010 and August 2010 to February 2011. Our island
   case studies share commonalities that point to similar experiences of
   colonialism and industrialisation and comparable health-related

PD 1999
PY 1999
AB Sea cucumbers, processed into beche-de-mer, are a valuable source of
   income for many; coastal communities in the developing nations of the
   Indo-Pacific. Increasing demand from China has caused overfishing of
   stocks of the high-value species. The potential to restore populations
   of tropical sea cucumbers and then sustain increased yields by stock
   enhancement is being assessed in a number of countries, including
   Ecuador, India, Kiribati, Maldives, the Marshall Islands and the Solomon
   Islands. Commercial species of sea cucumbers appear suitable for stock
   enhancement because they feed low on the food chain, are restricted to
   inshore habitats and are relatively sedentary and easy to harvest. Among
   the tropical sea cucumbers, sandfish (Holothuria scabra) appears to be a
   particularly good candidate for stock enhancement because of its high
   value, wide distribution, relative ease of culture and rapid growth at

   assessment of the potential of stock enhancement for restoring and
   managing fisheries for sandfish, research is now required to: (1)
   identify the genetic structure of wild stocks, (2) develop methods for
   marking cultured juveniles and (3) determine how to release juveniles to
   maximize their survival.

AB An outbreak of Streptococcus iniae occurred in the early months of 2008
   among wild reef fish in the waters of the Federation of St Kitts and
   Nevis, lasting almost 2 months. Moribund and dead fish were collected
   for gross, histological, bacteriological, and molecular analysis.
   Necropsy findings included diffuse fibrinous pericarditis, pale friable
   livers, and serosal petechiation. Cytological and histological analysis
   revealed granulocytic and granulomatous inflammation with abundant
   coccoid bacterial organisms forming long chains. Necrosis, inflammation,
   and vasculitis were most severe in the pericardium, meninges, liver,
   kidneys, and gills. Bacterial isolates revealed beta-hemolytic,
   Gram-positive coccoid bacteria identified as S. iniae by amplification
   and 16S ribosomal RNA gene sequencing. Results from biochemical and
   antimicrobial susceptibility analysis, together with repetitive element
   palindromic polymerase chain reaction fingerprinting, suggest that a
   single strain was responsible for the outbreak. The inciting cause for
   this S. iniae-associated cluster of mortalities is unknown.

   assembled and analyzed. The total number of confirmed marine mammal
   species for this part of the world is 11. The humpback whale (Megaptera
   novaeangliae) was the most commonly reported mysticete species-while a
   variety of odontocetes seem to be equally frequent in those waters. The
   manatee (Trichechus manatus) has been extinct from those waters for at
   least 300 years. Comparison with the marine mammal fauna of adjacent
   regions (Venezuela, Trinidad, and St. Vincent and the Grenadines), leads
   us to believe that at least seven additional species of cetaceans may be
   present in Grenadian waters, probably as occasional visitors.

AB Migrations of seven post-nesting green turtles at Rose Atoll (American
   Samoa) were tracked by satellite transmitters in 1993-1995. Most turtles
   migrated 1600 km to foraging areas in Fiji and occupied home ranges
   averaging 27 km(2). Additional tag recaptures from other studies
   indicate a common pattern of turtle movement in the central South
   Pacific region. In total, the 26 recaptures of primarily post-nesting
   turtles from French Polynesia, American Samoa, and Cook Islands showed a
   similar course of direction and destination: 96% migrated westward after
   nesting, with 58% going specifically to Fiji. We propose that this
   pattern reflects the lower availability of turtle food east of Fiji
   where most islands are small, steep and have limited areas suitable for
   seagrass or algal growth. In contrast, Fiji's extensive pastures of
   seagrass and algae appear to be a significant resource for many green
   turtles in the region. These turtles apparently spend most of their
   adult life in Fijian waters, taking only brief migrations to other
   islands to nest. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

   of Colombia. This study represents a first survey of the Colombian
   polyclad fauna. A total of 25 species were collected from the rocky
   littoral of the Tayrona National Park, Santa Marta, Colombia. Because
   color and color patterns represent major taxonomic characters in the
   classification of polyclads, photographic records were obtained from
   live specimens prior to fixation. Further taxonomic identification was
   based on major external features and serial longitudinal sections of the
   reproductive system. Numerically, Boninia divae Marcus and Marcus, 1968,
   followed by Styloplanocera fasciata ( Schmarda, 1859) were the most
   abundant species. Not only do all recorded species constitute first
   records for the Colombian coast of the Caribbean, but Cestoplana
   rubrocincta ( Grube, 1840), Armatoplana divae ( Marcus, 1947),
   Phaenoplana longipenis (Hyman, 1953), Eurylepta aurantiaca Heath and

   of the water were measured. Water currents during a month were also
   measured. The conditions at the three sites were good. The oxygen
   content in the water column was between 5.6 mill and 6.5 mill in October
   2005. The sediment was sandy and the organic content was 4.2-4.9 %. The
   chemical content was low, and the bottom fauna was rich and healthy,
   with diversity around 5. The maximum current at the nursery site was
   28.6 cm/s and the water current direction was mainly northward or

AB Priority setting is an essential component of biodiversity conservation.
   Existing methods to identify priority areas for conservation have
   focused almost entirely on biological factors. We suggest a new relative
   ranking method for identifying priority conservation areas that
   integrates both biological and social aspects. It is based on the
   following criteria: the habitat's status, human population pressure,
   human efforts to protect habitat, and number of endemic plant and
   vertebrate species. We used this method to rank 25 hotspots, 17
   megadiverse countries, and the hotspots within each megadiverse country.
   We used consistent, comprehensive, georeferenced, and multiband data
   sets and analytical remote sensing and geographic information system
   tools to quantify habitat status, human population pressure, and
   protection status. The ranking suggests that the Philippines, Atlantic
   Forest, Mediterranean Basin, Caribbean Islands, Caucasus, and Indo-Burma
   are the hottest hotspots and that China, the Philippines, and India are
   the hottest megadiverse countries. The great variation in terms of
   habitat, protected areas, and population pressure among the hotspots,
   the megadiverse countries, and the hotspots within the same country
   suggests the need for hotspot- and country-specific conservation
   policies.

AB We present a speleothem stable oxygen isotope record for the last 12.5
   ka based on two stalagmites from western Cuba. The delta O-18 signal is
   interpreted to represent past precipitation variability.
   Both stalagmites show a pronounced transition from higher delta O-18
   values (indicating drier conditions) to more negative delta O-18 values
   (suggesting wetter conditions) between 10 and 6 ka. This transition is
   also visible in a planktonic delta O-18 record off Haiti. On orbital
   timescales, the delta O-18 value of Caribbean precipitation, thus,
   strongly resembles the oxygen isotope composition of Caribbean surface
   water.
   On millenial timescales, the speleothem delta O-18 record shows a high
   correlation to a North Atlantic sea surface temperature (SST) record off
   West Africa as well as a similarity with the Bond events. Periods of
   lower North Atlantic SST correspond to less precipitation in the
   Caribbean and vice versa. The potential teleconnection to the Caribbean
   may reflect the position of the Intertropical Convergence Zone because a
   further southward position of the ITCZ leads to reduced precipitation in
   the northern Caribbean. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

PD November 2004
PY 2004
AB Effective conservation of regional biotas requires accurate information
   on the distribution, endemicity, local richness, and taxonomic
   composition of species assemblages across multiple geographic scales.
   This is especially true in the Melanesian region, which contains ten
   percent of the world's biota on its numerous islands scattered across
   thousands of kilometers between Fiji and the Moluccas. Although certain
   important biotic components within this region, such as birds, have been
   reasonably surveyed, many others, particularly freshwater organisms,
   remain poorly understood. To this end, a systematic survey program for
   freshwater fishes and invertebrates on New Guinea and nearby islands was
   undertaken over the last 10 years, involving an array of research
   organizations with long-standing interests in Melanesia, including the
   Bishop Museum, Smithsonian Institution, the Indonesian science ministry
   (LIPI), the Papua New Guinea National Museum and Gallery, and
   Conservation International. This work has also been augmented by
   partnerships with private sector entities operating in the region, most
   notably Chevron Niugini and P. T. Freeport Indonesia. These surveys have
   revealed previously unsuspected levels of species richness and endemism
   among New Guinea freshwater organisms, and the remarkable number of new
   species discovered during these surveys has also highlighted the fact
   that similar knowledge gaps and potentially similar levels of
   undocumented freshwater biodiversity remain through much of the rest of
   Melanesia beyond New Guinea. To the extent that they are now understood,
   Melanesian freshwater biotas appear to be characterized by foci of high
   endemicity clustered around tectonic provinces within individual large
   islands, such as New Guinea, or on geologically allied groups of smaller
   islands, such as the Louisiades and Solomons. In lotic systems, such as
   streams and rivers, this endemicity frequently displays a marked
   turnover in species elements along the length of individual catchments,
   linked to segregation of individual species by altitude, water
   temperature, substrate, bed profile and terminal reach salinity
   gradients. By contrast, lentic systems often harbor suites of localized
   endemic species centered around individual lakes or wetland complexes.
   Although known in a broad sense based on scattered collections made
   during the past 200 years and distributed among major museums,
   freshwater biotas of islands in the Melanesian region remain for the
   most part under-surveyed and poorly characterized taxonomically.

AB Background: Toxoplasma gondii is a protozoan parasite capable of
   infecting all warm-blooded animals. Humans can become infected by
   ingesting infective oocysts from the environment or contaminated food or
   water, or by ingesting tissue cysts in undercooked infected meat or by
   handling infected meat. Caribbean African green monkeys (Chlorocebus
   sabaeus) are present in large numbers on the island of St. Kitts in the
   Caribbean, and it is not uncommon for these animals to be trapped and
   eaten by islanders. The aim of this study was to determine T. gondii
   infection in Caribbean African green monkeys.
   Findings: Sera collected from 79 wild-caught Caribbean African green
   monkeys were examined for T. gondii antibodies by ELISA. Antibodies were
   detected in 38 out of 79 (48.1%) monkeys. Significantly more females
   were infected than males but there was no significant effect of age or
   location on antibody status.
   Conclusions: Results indicate that Caribbean African green monkeys can
   be infected with T. gondii and that there is widespread environmental
   contamination of St. Kitts with oocysts. These monkeys could present a
   potential source of T. gondii infection if their meat is consumed
   undercooked. This is the first report of T. gondii antibodies in this
   species.

   (Makassar, Sulawesi) and examination of 1,000 fungiids from museum
   collections (mainly National Museum of Natural History, Leiden) have
   shown that 36 coral species were infested by several species of
   Coralliophilidae belonging to the genus Leptoconchus. The rate of
   infestation of the mushroom coral assemblage varied from 0 to 7%. The
   two most infested Fungiidae were Fungia (Fungia) fungites and F.
   (Verrillofungia) repanda. At the east side of Laing Island, F. (F.)
   fungites reached an infestation rate of 19%, the highest value ever
   recorded. The rate of infestation was positively correlated with
   hydrodynamics and negatively with turbidity. It was, however, not
   correlated with the density of the fungiid assemblage. Infestation was
   maximum in shallow water (1-5 m); nearly no Leptoconchus spp. were found
   deeper than 20 m. Place of settlement of the mollusc (coral centre or
   edge), opening of the burrow (oral/aboral side of the coral) and
   deformation of coral skeleton varied according to the coral species
   infested. These variations seemed specifically related to the different
   Leptoconchus species rather than the infested host species.

AB New coral microatoll data allow presenting an updated late Holocene
   sea-level curve for the Gilbert Islands of Kiribati. Examination of
   build-up elevation and spatial distribution of microatolls, along with
   radiocarbon age data from coral samples, suggest an approximately 1 m
   sea-level high stand, possibly lasting from similar to 3500 to 1900 cal
   yr BP. Our sea-level curve, which is similar to the one reported from
   the Marshall Islands, is a baseline to reconstruct the evolution of reef
   flats and reef islands. In addition, it provides important contextual
   data to infer human settlement on islands in the west-central Pacific.

AB Satellite observations of wind, sea level and derived currents, sea
   surface temperature (SST), and chlorophyll are used to expand our
   understanding of the physical and biological variability of the ocean
   surface north of New Guinea. Based on scarce cruise and mooring data,
   previous studies differentiated a trade wind situation (austral winter)
   when the New Guinea Coastal Current (NGCC) flows northwestward and a
   northwest monsoon situation (austral summer) when a coastal upwelling
   develops and the NGCC reverses. This circulation pattern is confirmed by
   satellite observations, except in Vitiaz Strait where the surface
   northwestward flow persists. We find that intraseasonal and seasonal
   time scale variations explain most of the variance north of New Guinea.
   SST and chlorophyll variabilities are mainly driven by two processes:
   penetration of Solomon Sea waters and coastal upwelling. In the trade
   wind situation, the NGCC transports cold Solomon Sea waters through
   Vitiaz Strait in a narrow vein hugging the coast. Coastal upwelling is
   generated in westerly wind situations (westerly wind event, northwest
   monsoon). Highly productive coastal waters are advected toward the
   equator and, during some westerly wind events, toward the eastern part
   of the warm pool. During El Nino, coastal upwelling events and northward
   penetration of Solomon Sea waters combine to influence SST and
   chlorophyll anomalies.

AB Understanding the host range for all of the fruit fly species within the
   South Pacific region is vital to establishing trade and quarantine
   protocols. This is important for the countries within the region and
   their trade partners. A significant aspect of the Australian Centre for
   International Agricultural Research (ACIAR) and Regional Fruit Fly
   Projects (RFFP) has been host fruit collecting which has provided
   information on fruit fly host records in the seven participating
   countries. This work is still continuing in all project countries at
   different intensities. In the Cook Islands, Fiji, Tonga and Western
   Samoa, fruit surveys have assumed a quarantine surveillance role, with a
   focus on high risk fruits, such as guava, mango, citrus, bananas,
   cucurbits and solanaceous fruits. In the Solomon Islands, Vanuatu and
   the Federated States of Micronesia (FSM), fruit surveys are still at the
   stage where host ranges are far from complete. By the end of the current
   project a more complete picture of the fruit fly hosts in these
   countries will have bean gained.
   A brief summary of the data collected to date is as follows: 23947 fruit
   samples collected to date; 2181 positive host fruit records; 31 fruit
   fly species reared from fruit; 12 species reared from commercial fruit.
   A commercial fruit is classed as an edible fruit with potential for
   trade at either a local or international level. This allows for the
   inclusion of endemic fruit species that have cultural significance as a
   food source. On the basis of these results, there are fruit fly species
   of major economic importance in the South Pacific region. However,
   considerably more fruit survey work is required in order to establish a
   detailed understanding of all the pest species.

AB Aim
   This study addresses the origins of terrestrial biodiversity of the
   Fijian islands using the ant genus Lordomyrma (Hymenoptera: Formicidae:
   Myrmicinae) as a model system. We derive the evolution of the genus and
   determine its closest extra-Fijian relatives from geological data,
   molecular phylogenetic reconstruction and divergence estimates.
   Location
   Ant taxa were sampled in the Southwest Pacific, Melanesia, Southeast
   Asia, Australia and mainland China.
   Methods
   Phylogeny and divergence estimates of the ant genus Lordomyrma based on
   four nuclear genes (28S, ArgK, LW Rh, CAD) plus data on Indo-Pacific
   geological history are used to address current hypotheses regarding the
   origins of the Fijian biota.
   Results
   The genus Lordomyrma probably originated in mainland Asia, with
   subsequent colonization of Australia and the Pacific. The Fijian
   Lordomyrma clade is monophyletic, and originated c. 8.8 Ma, when it
   diverged from a sister group in Papua New Guinea.
   Main conclusions
   The colonization of Fiji by Lordomyrma is probably a result of
   long-distance dispersal from New Guinea, possibly aided by island
   hopping across the Vitiaz Arc. The timeline of diversification in
   Lordomyrma is broadly congruent with the Miocene fragmentation of the
   Vitiaz Arc and the Pliocene emergence of Vanua Levu. The biotic shuttle
   hypothesis, which posits 'Eua Island as the source of Fijian endemics,
   is rejected based on the sister relationship of Fiji and New Guinea
   lineages, as well as on the Miocene submergence of the terrane below sea
   level. The diversity of Fijian Lordomyrma results from the radiation of
   a single lineage, which diverged from a New Guinea sister group. The
   genus appears to have originated in Asia rather than in Australia.

AB I present research investigating biodiversity and human interaction with
   the local environment through three perspectives on diverse islands in
   Fiji's Lau Group. First, I generated long-term data on marine diversity
   and exploitation through zooarchaeological analyses of fauna from sites
   spanning the region's prehistoric human occupation. The study areas are
   representative of regional fauna and local geographic variation in
   island size and structure. Each island also varies in terms of human
   occupation and degree of impacts on marine and terrestrial environments.
   Second, my ethnographic work recorded modern marine exploitation
   patterns by Lauan communities. Third, marine biological surveys
   documented living faunas. Together this information is used to explore
   the marine environment over the three millennia of human occupation.
   Using data derived from my multipronged study I discuss potential causes
   of ecological change in this tropical marine setting. My, findings
   include the following: (1) data indicate that relative intensity of
   human Occupation and exploitation determines modern composition and
   biological diversity of marine communities because human disturbance
   occurred more extensively on larger islands than on smaller islands in
   Lau; (2) Lauans appear to have targeted similar suites of marine fauna
   across their 3,000 years of history on these islands; (3) Lauans have
   had a selective effect on marine biodiversity because particular species
   are/were targeted according to local standards of ranking and
   preference; (4) marine resources existing today have withstood over
   3,000 years of human impacts and therefore may have life history traits
   supporting resilience and making conservation efforts worthwhile.

AB This paper examines vulnerability in two Melanesian small island
   developing states: Solomon Islands and Vanuatu. With large proportions
   of the population living semi-subsistence lifestyles in rural areas,
   consumption poverty is notoriously difficult to measure. The paper
   therefore departs from the standard approach and assesses household
   vulnerability to multidimensional poverty. The paper employs
   cross-sectional data from a household survey. Results indicate that
   vulnerability is more widespread than poverty and that vulnerability
   stems more from excess volatility in expected wellbeing than a
   particularly low expected level of wellbeing, per se. Results point to a
   pressing need for formal social protection policies to be implemented.

   that there is a positive association between financial development and

   growth tends to lead financial development in Singapore and Jamaica,
   financial development leads growth in Trinidad and Tobago and there is a
   bidirectional link in Barbados. These results therefore suggest that
   cross-country studies could overstate the impact of financial
   development on growth, since they ignore differences - even in

   awareness of food safety practices of consumers in Trinidad and
   Barbados. A structured questionnaire was self-administered to 148
   respondents. Data were analysed by descriptive and chi-square analysis.
   Most (92%) consumers rated having safe food practices as 'very
   important'. Only 25.7% heard of the acronym 'HACCP' (Hazard Analysis and
   Critical Control Point), associated the HACCP approach to safe food
   preparation (25.7%) and reported it recommendatory in homes (19.6%).
   More than one-third (45.6%) felt that up to 20% of food poisoning was
   associated to the home. Over the last 12 months, 18.2% of consumers
   and/or family members had experienced food-borne illness, but no one
   associated it to the home. More (P < 0.01) consumers in Trinidad than in
   Barbados were aware of the HACCP, experienced food-borne illness and
   allowed pets in the kitchen. This study identified many gaps in proper
   food safety practices in the homes.

AB During surveys of the Gastrotricha of the Tropical Northwestern Atlantic
   (TNWA, Caribbean Sea), we came across numerous specimens of the uncommon
   macrodasyidan, Xenodasys riedli (Xenodasyidae). Abundance data on
   gastrotrichs is rare and entirely absent for this species; moreover,
   there are no data on morphological variation of X. riedli outside its
   type locality (North Carolina, USA). Here, we provide new abundance data
   on specimens collected from St. John Island (US Virgin Islands), as well
   as new metric and morphological data from specimens collected on San
   Salvador Island (Bahamas), Tobago, and a sublittoral environment on the
   Atlantic Coast of Florida (USA). In the interstitial environments of St.
   John, X. riedli was most abundant at 0.8 m depth in moderately
   well-sorted sediments. It reached maximum abundance of 89.5 +/- 42.7
   ind./10(2) cm and made up 69.7% of the total taxocoenosis. Metric
   variation revealed that specimens at all sites in the TNWA and Florida
   had smaller body sizes than those recorded at the type locality, but
   showed only limited variation in the size and number of taxonomic
   characters. Observations of specimen from Florida using scanning
   electron microscopy (SEM) revealed details that were overlooked in the
   type description. For example, we observed 8 dorsal head plates (11 in
   the original description), 1 pair of anterior medial plates, and 3
   ventral plates, the latter of which were not described in the type
   specimens. We confirm the existence of round scales on the dorsolateral
   margins, and note that spineless-scales are also present in between the
   spined scales on the lateral body wall. We also determined that the
   lateral spined scales possess dorsal and ventral spines instead of
   anterior and posterior spines, which was their original assumed
   position. This research reveals that SEM remains the best diagnostic
   tool for characterizing gastrotrich morphology, and should be part of
   all future studies of gastrotrich taxonomy.

AB In the southwest Pacific, thermocline waters connecting the tropics to
   the equator via western boundary currents (WBCs) transit through the
   Solomon Sea. Despite its importance in feeding the Equatorial
   Undercurrent (EUC) and its related potential influence on the
   low-frequency modulation of ENSO, the circulation inside the Solomon Sea
   is poorly documented. A 1/12 degrees model has been implemented to
   analyze the mean and the seasonal variability of the Solomon Sea
   thermocline circulation. The circulation involves an inflow from the
   open southern Solomon Sea, which is distributed via WBCs between the
   three north exiting straits of the semiclosed Solomon Sea. The system of
   WBCs is found to be complex. Its main feature, the New Guinea Coastal
   Undercurrent, splits in two branches: one flowing through Vitiaz Strait
   and the other one, the New Britain Coastal Undercurrent (NBCU), exiting
   at Solomon Strait. East of the Solomon Sea, the encounter of the South
   Equatorial Current (SEC) with the Solomon Islands forms a previously
   unknown current, which the authors call the Solomon Islands Coastal
   Undercurrent (SICU). The NBCU, SEC, and SICU participate in the feeding
   of the New Ireland Coastal Undercurrent (NICU), which retroflects to the
   Equatorial Undercurrent, providing the most direct western boundary EUC
   connection, which is particularly active in June August. The Solomon Sea
   WBC seasonal variability results from the combination of equatorial
   dynamics, remotely forced Rossby waves north of 10 degrees S, and the
   spinup and spindown of the subtropical gyre as a response of Rossby
   waves forced south of 10 degrees S.

   continues to threaten the economy and ecology of Guam and is currently
   the subject of a cooperative program to control snake populations on the
   island and prevent its spread throughout the Pacific Rim. Delivery of
   toxic baits is a primary component of population suppression efforts.
   While many food items tested as baits for toxicant delivery provide
   relevant food prey cues leading to investigatory behaviors in BTS, only
   a few items tested in the past two decades have adequately promoted
   reliable consumption. Chief among them is the dead neonatal mouse (DNM).
   A series of chemical and bioassays were performed to identify materials
   with similar sensory qualities as DNM. Among the many items tested in a
   series of field experiments with free-ranging BTS in Guam, a processed
   meat product treated with an artificial mouse fat mixture was found to
   be removed from bait stations at rates greater than previously tested
   DNM substitutes and approaching removal rates of DNM. Furthermore, the
   test baits demonstrated excellent durability under field conditions.
   Further development of this bait offers great potential to satisfy many
   desirable attributes for BTS baiting operations.

   increases in frequency of queenless colonies prior to their
   disappearance. Concordant with these declines, several nonsocial,
   pair-forming Synalpheus species increased in frequency. The decline in
   eusocial shrimp is explained in part by disappearance of two sponge
   species on which they specialize. Eusocial shrimp collections from
   Jamaica in 2012 showed similar patterns of decline in colony size and
   increased queenlessness compared with prior Jamaican collections. The
   decline and local extinction of eusocial shrimp happened against a
   backdrop of changes in coral assemblages during recent decades, and may
   reflect changes in abundance and quality of dead coral substratum and
   succession of the diverse cryptic organisms living within it. These
   changes document potentially worrisome declines in a unique taxon of
   eusocial marine animals.

AB The Republic of Kiribati is a small, highly infertile Pacific Island
   nation and is one of the most challenging locations to attempt to
   support dense urban populations. Kiribati, like other nations in the
   Pacific, faces an urban future where food insecurity, unemployment,
   waste management and malnutrition will become increasing issues.
   Homegardening is suggested as one way to address many of these problems.
   However, the most recent study on agriculture production in urban
   centres in Kiribati shows that, in general, intensive cultivation of
   homegardens is not a common practice. This disparity between theory and
   practice creates an opportunity to re-examine homegardening in Kiribati
   and, more broadly, in the Pacific. This paper examines the practice of
   homegardening in urban centres in Kiribati and explores reasons why
   change has or has not occurred through interviews with homegardeners and
   government/donor representatives. Results show that homegardening has
   increased significantly in the past five years, largely because of the
   promotion of homegardens and organic composting systems by donor
   organisations. While findings further endorse homegardening as an
   excellent theoretical solution to many of the problems that confront
   urban settlements in Kiribati and the Pacific, it raises additional
   questions regarding the continuation of homegarden schemes beyond donor
   support programmes.

AB Small island developing states (SIDS) are vulnerable due to their small
   size in both biophysical and socio-economic senses. They are
   increasingly confronted with the environmental consequences through
   utilisation of their fragile natural resources for economic development.
   Here we illustrate the dilemmas experienced by SIDS associated with
   sustainable economic development. Our focus is the main island of the
   Kingdom of Tonga, Tongatapu, located in the South Pacific Ocean. We
   analyse the intensification of agriculture and the attendant pressures
   on the islands freshwater resources. We combine environmental and
   economic data. Tongatapu (256 km(2)) is a raised coral atoll and the
   freshwater resources exist as lenses that float on top of denser salt
   water underneath the island. Since 1987 Tonga has exported squash
   pumpkin solely to Japan. Over the last 10 years, these exports have
   accounted for more then 40% of total export earnings, and represent 60%
   to 70% of GDP derived from agricultural export. This increase in exports
   is matched by an abrupt increase in the import and usage of agricultural
   chemicals. The island's freshwater lenses are increasingly under
   pressure from agricultural intensification. In the economic decision
   process, environmental impacts are not taken into account. This is
   partly because of overlapping institutional responsibilities of water
   management, and opaque institutional structures which are highlighted in
   the paper. The environmental consequences experienced by SIDS in terms
   of primary production stresses the need of taking natural capital into
   account when the benefits from international trade are evaluated. At the
   same time pollution will result in irrecoverable losses in terms of
   tourist potential. Improved agricultural practices have to be
   implemented through educational tools to ensure continuing economic
   prosperity derived from agricultural exports. Economic development of
   SIDS should also focus on the maintenance of kin relationships overseas,
   securing rent incomes and regional cooperative development efforts. (c)

AB Background: The mosquito Culex annulirostris Skuse (Diptera: Culicidae)
   is the major vector of endemic arboviruses in Australia and is also
   responsible for the establishment of the Japanese encephalitis virus
   (JEV) in southern Papua New Guinea (PNG) as well as its incursions into
   northern Australia. Papua New Guinea and mainland Australia are
   separated by a small stretch of water, the Torres Strait, and its
   islands. While there has been regular JEV activity on these islands, JEV
   has not established on mainland Australia despite an abundance of Cx.
   annulirostris and porcine amplifying hosts. Despite the public health
   significance of this mosquito and the fact that its adults show
   overlapping morphology with close relative Cx. palpalis Taylor, its
   evolution and genetic structure remain undetermined. We address a
   hypothesis that there is significant genetic diversity in Cx.
   annulirostris and that the identification of this diversity will shed
   light on the paradox that JEV can cycle on an island 70 km from mainland
   Australia while not establishing in Australia itself. Results: We
   sequenced 538 bp of the mitochondrial DNA cytochrome oxidase I gene from
   273 individuals collected from 43 localities in Australia and the
   southwest Pacific region to describe the phylogeography of Cx.
   annulirostris and its sister species Cx. palpalis. Maximum Likelihood
   and Bayesian analyses reveal supporting evidence for multiple divergent
   lineages that display geographic restriction. Culex palpalis contained
   three divergent lineages geographically restricted to southern
   Australia, northern Australia and Papua New Guinea (PNG). Culex
   annulirostris contained five geographically restricted divergent
   lineages, with one lineage restricted to the Solomon Islands and two
   identified mainly within Australia while two other lineages showed
   distributions in PNG and the Torres Strait Islands with a southern limit
   at the top of Australia's Cape York Peninsula. Conclusion: The existence
   of divergent mitochondrial lineages within Cx. annulirostris and Cx.
   palpalis helps explain the difficulty of using adult morphology to
   identify Cx. annulirostris and its ecological diversity. Notably, the
   southern limit of the PNG lineages of Cx. annulirostris coincides
   exactly with the current southern limit of JEV activity in Australasia
   suggesting that variation in these COI lineages may be the key to why
   JEV has not yet established yet on mainland Australia.

AB When a population extends across international boundaries, management
   becomes more complex. This is especially true within a confined
   multinational area such as the Caribbean Sea. The population size of
   sperm whales in the Eastern Caribbean is estimated and the inter-island
   movements of individuals are quantified using a database of 1,394
   photographic identifications taken between 1984 and 2006 by several
   research groups. A total of 194 individual sperm whales were identified
   off the leeward coasts of the islands of Dominica, Guadeloupe. Grenada.
   St. Lucia and Martinique. Population size was estimated using
   two-component finite mixture models. About 145 (95% CI=94-219) sperm
   whales used Lesser Antillean waters in 1995 and this population appears
   to be growing slowly. There are differences amongst the individuals in
   their probability of identification. Of all individuals, 57 (29.4%) were
   identified during more than one year between 1995 and 2006. Long-term
   reidentification of associated females suggests that social units may be
   using the area for periods of at least 11 years. Twenty seven confirmed
   matches were made between islands, the majority (92.6%) of which were
   between Guadeloupe and Dominica, although there were two longer
   movements by single individuals between Dominica and the islands of St.
   Lucia and Grenada. High reidentification rates within the Lesser
   Antilles and no matches with identifications from nearby seas suggest
   the population in the Eastern Caribbean Sea is small and quite isolated.
   As such, we recommend that management actions be taken on a multi-island
   basis for the Eastern Caribbean, by encouraging the ratification of the
   SPAW protocols and that the current stock classification for the North
   Atlantic be reconsidered.

   around both Sao Tome and Principe islands. We document the faunal
   composition, structure and habitat specificity of assemblages and
   compare the foraminiferal biotas to those found within the Gulf of
   Guinea, and other southern Africa coasts. Over 5700 benthic foraminifera
   belonging to 106 species including agglutinated, perforatehyaline and
   imperforate-porcellaneous types were recovered from 12 sample sites.
   Cluster, species richness and principal component analyses reveal
   habitat specific faunal assemblages characterized by distinct species
   composition and faunal indices. The coastal waters of Sao Tome and
   Principe were found to harbor more species of larger symbiont-bearing
   foraminifera (LBF) than ever recorded within the Gulf of Guinea region.
   The LBF recorded are numerically abundant, vital producers of
   carbonaceous sediments and are of particular biogeographic interest.

AB Extant brachiopods and crinoids flourish together in the deeper waters
   of the Caribbean. Analogous brachiopod/crinoid associations are known
   from the Pleistocene of Jamaica (deeper-water fore reef), and the
   Miocene of Jamaica (island slope chalks), Barbados (accretionary prism)
   and Carriacou (turbiditic siliciclastic shelf). Brachiopod occurrences
   include at least two taxa from the terebratulide trinity of
   Argyrotheca-Terebratulina-Tichosina, less commonly associated with other
   taxa; crinoids are principally isocrinids, invariably including
   Neocrinus. Comparison with analogous modern environments indicates
   deposition in 150+m water depth. In Carriacou, the presence of
   brachiopods and crinolds has disproved the supposition that the Middle
   Miocene Grand Bay Formation was shallow water in origin.

AB Fiji is an island country with just over 300 small islands and
   approximately 853,000 people. It is a small island developing state
   (SIDS) that is heavily dependent on imported fossil fuel for its energy
   needs. The paper attempts to determine the past and current energy
   situation in Fiji, challenges faced and strategizes to overcome these
   challenges. In 2014, Fiji generated 859 GW h of grid electricity from
   259.8 MW of power plants. Here, 45.4% of grid electricity was produced
   by hydro, 50.9% by diesel generators and the remaining by biomass.
   However, Fiji's transport sector is completely dependent on fossil fuels
   with fuel import bill equivalent to an average 58% of export earnings
   and taking up 21% of total import bill. The smallness of Fiji and
   dispersed islands within Fiji group leads to many challenges to have
   accessible, affordable and sustainable energy supply. These challenges
   are comprehensively discussed in this paper. Strategies such as
   increasing private-public partnership in renewable energy projects,
   changing customer behavior, setting up a credible feed-in tariff
   structure, developing locally owned business in renewable energy and
   energy efficiency, setting up of risk mitigation facilities and
   strengthening institutions supporting energy sector are discussed to
   overcome or minimize challenges.

AB In the Coral Triangle community-based marine protected areas (MPAs) are
   being established at a prolific rate. Their establishment can benefit
   both fisheries and biodiversity, and they provide both a socially and
   economically acceptable means of managing coral reefs in developing
   nations. However, because such MPAs are typically small (usually <0.5
   km(2)), they will rarely provide protection to large mobile fishes. An
   exception to this limitation may exist when community-based MPAs are
   established to protect small sites where vital processes occur, such as
   fish spawning aggregations (FSAs). To test the effectiveness of small
   (0.1-0.2 km(2)) MPAs for protecting FSAs, we monitored three FSA sites
   where brown-marbled grouper (Epinephelus fuscoguttatus), camouflage
   grouper (Epinephelus polyphekadion) and squaretail coralgrouper
   (Plectropomus areolatus) aggregate to spawn. Sites were monitored during
   peak reproductive periods (several days prior to each new moon) between
   January 2005 and November 2009. All three sites are located in New
   Ireland Province, Papua New Guinea, and had been exploited for decades,
   but in 2004 two sites were protected by the establishment of
   community-based MPAs. The third site continued to be exploited. Over the
   monitoring period densities of E. fuscoguttatus and E. polyphekadion
   increased at both MPAs, but not at the site that remained open to
   fishing. At one MPA the densities of E. polyphekadion increased tenfold.
   Our findings demonstrate that community-based MPAs that are
   appropriately designed and adequately enforced can lead to the recovery
   of populations of vulnerable species that aggregate to spawn. (C) 2011

AB Historically there has been limited institutional postharvest research,
   education and training in the South Pacific. In Fiji, Western Samoa and
   Tonga, of the three universities, four government ministries and one
   regional agency, that currently posses horticulture research, extension
   or training capacity, few have any dedicated postharvest specialists.
   While private-sector postharvest extension services do exist they are
   often fragmented and commonly limited to specific export-focused supply
   chains. In the last decade, increasing concerns about regional food
   security and a greater emphasis towards expanding horticultural trade
   and exports have resulted in significant investment in new postharvest
   infrastructure in the region. Since 2008, postharvest research
   infrastructure has been established in Western Samoa and in Tonga,
   coupled with ongoing donor assistance of private-sector
   postharvest-export infrastructure in Fiji. Unfortunately there has been
   desultory attention towards concurrently improving postharvest skills
   and training. This is of particular concern as it undermines the
   ultimate effectiveness of this investment, creating questionable
   sustainability. This paper reviews the current postharvest horticulture
   research and education capacity in the Pacific highlighting the key
   challenges and opportunities.

AB PIXE-PIGME analysis of 19 obsidian artefacts from Lakeba Island in east
   Fiji identified contact with northern Vanuatu in the post-colonization
   period (c. 2500-1000 bp) of Fiji. The Lakeba obsidian is the only
   physical evidence for interaction across the 850 km water gap separating
   the archipelagos of Vanuatu and Fiji in the first millennium ad. New
   research on the Vanuatu obsidian sources with laser ablation -
   inductively coupled plasma - mass spectrometry (LA-ICP-MS) casts serious
   doubt on the validity of a long-distance inter-archipelago connection in
   the post-Lapita era. This paper presents the re-analysis of 18 obsidian
   artefacts from Lakeba using LA-ICP-MS and radiogenic isotope results
   that demonstrate that the Lakeba obsidian is not from Vanuatu, and it
   most likely derives from the Fiji-Tonga region. Geochemical evidence for
   long-distance interaction and migration between the West and Central
   Pacific in the post-Lapita era has yet to be identified.

AB The Chuuk Lagoon Atoll in the Caroline Islands system is located near
   the hotspot of tropical marine shallow-water diversity and adjacent to
   the global reef carbonate production center. It consists of a set of
   larger islands and smaller islets that are arranged in a triangular
   lagoonal atoll system surrounded by a protective reef barrier. This area
   constitutes an important biogeographic link between the Coral Triangle
   and other eastern Pacific Islands chains such as the Society, Marshall,
   Gilbert or Cook Islands. The Chuuk Islands also represent an area from
   which modern benthic foraminifera are virtually unknown. This study
   documents benthic foraminiferal assemblages from lagoonal habitats
   within the Chuuk Atoll to complete the record along the W-E Pacific
   biodiversity gradient and to assess their biogeographic relation to
   adjacent faunal provinces. Our analysis and systematic survey documents
   that shallow-water lagoonal sediments harbour diverse assemblages of at
   least 104 species of benthic foraminifera. The complete fauna is
   identified to species level and fully illustrated by scanning electron
   microscopy. Faunal comparisons of larger symbiont-bearing taxa with
   neighbouring biogeographic regions indicates that the foraminiferal
   assemblages from the Chuuk Island Lagoon represent a transitional
   biogeographic region between the high diverse Coral Triangle and East
   Pacific island chains. These findings are consistent with species
   richness patterns observed in zooxanthellate bearing reef corals, where
   diversity progressively drops off from the Coral Triangle towards the
   eastern Pacific.

   of Strepsipterans. Many families in Cuba are poorly or not at all
   studied and additional species will be found. The fauna contains 1,495
   endemic species - species which are naturally limited to Cuba. There are
   1,092 native species - these have natural distributions in adjacent or
   surrounding land masses (the Bahama Islands, Florida and the
   southeastern United States, Jamaica, the Cayman Islands, Mexico and
   Central America, and Hispaniola and other Caribbean islands to the
   east). There are 86 species which are recognized to have been introduced
   by human activities and many of these are pests of agriculture,
   forestry, or stored products. The fauna is disharmonic (unbalanced), as
   is expected for an oceanic island fauna which has long been isolated by
   water. Several families that occur on the continental margins of the
   Caribbean are apparently not present in Cuba. Geological history
   suggests that Cuba has existed as an island and has been available for
   insect colonization for the past 35 million years. Species movement to
   and from Cuba may have been more frequent at times of past low sea
   levels during Pleistocene glacials, when the neighboring continental
   margins and Caribbean islands were more exposed and the water gaps
   between them and Cuba were smaller. Twenty-eight genera contain 10 or
   more species limited to Cuba and may represent island "species swarms."

   solid waste management. The waste generation rates of SIDS were compared
   within the three geographic regions namely Caribbean SIDS, Pacific SIDS
   and Atlantic, Indian Ocean, Mediterranean and South China (AIMS) SIDS
   and with countries of the Organisation for Economic Co-Operation and
   Development (OECD). Only Pacific SIDS had a waste generation rate less
   than 1 kg/capita/day. The waste generation rates for the three SIDS
   regions averaged 1.29 kg/capita/day while that for OECD countries was at
   a mean value of 1.35 kg/capita/day. The waste compositions in the
   different SIDS regions were almost similar owing to comparable
   consumption patterns while these differed to a large extent with wastes
   generated in OECD countries. In SIDS, the major fraction of MSW
   comprised of organics (44%) followed by recyclables namely paper,
   plastics, glass and metals (total: 43%). In contrast, MSW in OECD
   countries consisted mainly of recyclables (43%) followed by organics
   (37%). This article also reviewed the other functional elements of the
   waste management systems in SIDS. Several shortcomings were noted in the
   process of waste collection, transfer and transport namely the fact of
   having outdated collection vehicles and narrow roads which are
   inaccessible. Among the waste management practices in SIDS, waste
   disposal via landfilling, illegal dumping and backyard burning were
   favoured most of the time at the expense of sustainable waste treatment
   technologies such as composting, anaerobic digestion and recycling. (C)

AB Islands are especially susceptible to the loss of indigenous species
   following anthropogenic change. Although tourism has long been cited as
   a justification for conserving biodiversity via the establishment of
   national parks and reserves, it also contributes to biodiversity loss as
   a result of direct habitat change and human activities, as well as more
   indirectly via the introduction of exotic species and environmental
   change. An island biogeographical approach is used to provide an
   exploratory analysis of tourism and biodiversity relationships in the
   Caribbean and Pacific Islands. Data suggest that the islands are under
   heavy anthropogenic pressure, of which tourism is just one element,
   although for some countries tourism represents a substantial real
   increase in the size of the human population. Few of the countries
   examined have anywhere near the recommended percentage of area
   protected, with marine ecosystems being least conserved. The study
   concludes that there are significant data gaps for examining tourism and
   biodiversity relations at the national level, but suggests that island
   biogeographical approaches may yield significant insights into the
   pressures of tourism on biodiversity at smaller scales if adequate data
   can be gained.

   The assemblage at a site reflects the live assemblage and post mortem
   affects such as dissolution and transport during storms. Reefal species
   (Amphistegina gibbosa, Asterigerina carinata) are transported towards
   shore during storms. Foraminiferal thanatacoenoses were examined in 65
   nearshore sediment samples from around five eastern Caribbean islands:
   St. John (US Virgin Islands), St. Kitts, Nevis, Bequia and Tobago.
   Cluster and principal components analyses distinguished the following
   environments (indicator species in parentheses):

   2. Bays subject to organic matter enrichment (Quinqueloculina poeyana,

   4. Locations subject to high sediment flux during storms (Amphistegina
   gibbosa),
   5. Sites little stressed by organic matter enrichment or storms

TI Craniid brachiopods: aspects of clade structure and distribution reflect

AB We present maximum likelihood and Bayesian inference relative time-tree
   analyses of aligned gene sequences from a worldwide collection of
   craniiform brachiopods belonging to two genera, Novocrania and
   Neoancistrocrania. Sequences were obtained from one mitochondrial and
   three nuclear-encoded ribosomal RNA genes from varying numbers of
   specimens. Data-exploration by network (splits) analyses indicates that
   each gene identifies the same divergent clades and (with one minor
   exception) the same inter-clade relationships. Neoancistrocrania
   specimens were found only in the Pacific Ocean, near Japan, on the
   Norfolk and Chesterfield Ridges, and near the Solomon Islands. The
   Novocrania clades, in approximate order of increasing distance from the
   root comprise 1. a 'Northern' clade of animals collected in the NE.
   Atlantic, W. Mediterranean and Adriatic; 2. a 'Tethyan' clade comprising
   animals from the E. Mediterranean, Cape Verde islands and the Caribbean
   (Belize and Jamaica); 3. a 'NE. Pacific' clade containing animals from
   Vancouver Island and from localities near Japan and south of Taiwan; 4.
   a 'Southern' clade that contains two widely separated subclades, one
   from New Zealand and the other with an extraordinarily wide
   distribution, ranging from near Japan in the north to the Chesterfield
   Ridge and Solomon Islands in the West, and in the East to the Galapagos
   Islands, the coast of South America (Chile) and Richardson seamount (off
   South Africa) in the South Atlantic. To the South, members of this clade
   were found in the Weddell, Scotia and Bellinghausen Antarctic Seas. The
   root of the extant craniid radiation was previously found (by
   relaxed-clock analysis) to lie on the branch connecting the two genera
   so that, in effect, the one clade of Neoancistrocrania serves to
   polarise evolutionary relationships within the several clades of
   Novocrania. As previously suggested, all results confirm that
   Neoancistrocrania is sister to the 'Northern' Novocrania clade, and this
   leads to a proposal that Neoancistrocrania represents one extreme of a
   wide range of variation in ancestral ventral valve mineralisation,
   speciation (similar to 90 Ma) resulting from competitive exclusion in
   rapidly-growing reef environments. To the extent possible, the
   identified molecular clades are correlated with named species of
   Novocrania.
   The reproductive and population biology of craniid brachiopods is not
   well known, but from available evidence they are considered to have
   low-dispersal potential and, except in enclosed localities such as
   cold-water fjords, to have small effective population sizes, features
   which are consistent with the observed divergent populations in
   well-separated localities. Exceptionally slow craniid molecular (rDNA)
   evolution is suggested by the short branch of Novocrania where it has
   been used as an outgroup for large-scale analyses of metazoans. Slow
   molecular evolution is also indicated by the existence of a distinct
   Tethyan clade, reflecting restricted dispersal at former times, and by
   the uniform, short, genetic distances and exceptionally wide
   geographical distribution of the Southern clade. Thus, the geographical
   distribution and phylogenetic divergence of craniid brachiopods is an
   example of phylotectonics, in which relationships revealed by
   phylogenetic analyses reflect opportunities for dispersal and settlement
   that were created by tectonic plate movements associated, in this case,
   with opening and closure of Tethys and the breakup of Gondwana.
   Molecular dating of craniid divergences and radiochemical dating of
   tectonic events thus illuminate one another.

AB The Greater Caribbean biogeographic region is the high-diversity heart
   of the Tropical West Atlantic, one of four global centers of tropical
   marine biodiversity. The traditional view of the Greater Caribbean is
   that it is limited to the Caribbean, West Indies, southwest Gulf of
   Mexico and tip of Florida, and that, due to its faunal homogeneity,
   lacks major provincial subdivisions. In this scenario the northern 2/3
   of the Gulf of Mexico and southeastern USA represent a separate
   temperate, "Carolinian'' biogeographic region. We completed a
   comprehensive re-assessment of the biogeography of the Greater Caribbean
   by comparing the distributions of 1,559 shorefish species within 45
   sections of shelf waters of the Greater Caribbean and adjacent areas.
   This analysis shows that that the Greater Caribbean occupies a much
   larger area than usually thought, extending south to at least Guyana,
   and north to encompass the entire Carolinian area. Rather than being
   homogenous, the Greater Caribbean is divided into three major provinces,
   each with a distinctive, primarily tropical fauna: (1) a central,
   tropical province comprising the West Indies, Bermuda and Central
   America; (2) a southern, upwelling-affected province spanning the entire
   continental shelf of northern South America; and (iii) a northern,
   subtropical province that includes all of the Gulf of Mexico, Florida
   and southeastern USA. This three-province pattern holds for both
   reef-and soft bottom fishes, indicating a general response by demersal
   fishes to major variation in provincial shelf environments. Such
   environmental differences include latitudinal variation in sea
   temperature, availability of major habitats (coral reefs, soft bottom
   shorelines, and mangroves), and nutrient additions from upwelling areas
   and large rivers. The three-province arrangement of the Greater
   Caribbean broadly resembles and has a similar environmental basis to the
   provincial arrangement of its sister biogeographic region, the Tropical
   Eastern Pacific.

AB The six Coral Triangle countries: Indonesia, Malaysia, Papua New Guinea,
   Philippines, Solomon Islands, and Timor-Leste, each have evolving
   systems of marine protected areas (MPAs) at the national and local
   levels. Now with more than 1,900 MPAs covering 208,152km(2) (1.6% of the
   extended economic zone for the region), the Coral Triangle Initiative
   for Coral Reefs, Fisheries and Food Security has endorsed a Regional
   Plan of Action that contains a target of establishing a Coral Triangle
   Marine Protected Area System as part of its third goal on improving MPA
   management. This article details the contents of the Coral Triangle
   Marine Protected Area System Framework and Action Plan and describes its
   development and potential contribution to the improved management in the
   region once it is implemented. The MPA System Framework, as endorsed by
   the six countries, contains guidance for standardizing how MPAs and MPA
   networks are evaluated for effectiveness, and provides options for
   scaling-up existing MPAs to networks of MPAs that are more ecologically
   linked, integrated with fisheries management and responsive to changing
   climate. The Framework establishes an institutional mechanism by which
   the regional entity can facilitate the continued development and
   implementation of a region-wide MPA system that provides incentives for
   improved quality of management and enhanced marine area coverage at the
   local scale.

AB Salmonella and Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli are two of the
   main causes of foodborne disease globally, and while they have been
   implicated as possible causes of foodborne disease within the Caribbean
   region, the actual incidence is unknown. Trinidad and Tobago, one of the
   larger countries in the Caribbean, has an estimated annual foodborne
   disease burden of over 100,000 cases and, similar to other countries,
   the etiology of most of these cases is unknown. Both pathogens can
   reside as part of the normal gastrointestinal microflora of many wild
   and domestic animals, with animals acting as reservoirs, spillover
   hosts, or dead-end hosts. Carriage in animal species can be asymptomatic
   or, in the case of Salmonella in particular, there may be clinical
   manifestation in animals, which resemble the disease seen in humans. In
   this review, we will focus on the epidemiology of these two foodborne
   pathogens in Trinidad and Tobago and identify any knowledge gaps in the
   published literature. The filling of this critical knowledge void is
   essential for the development and implementation of appropriate
   mechanisms to reduce the dissemination and transmission of these
   pathogens, not only in Trinidad and Tobago, but also in the wider
   Caribbean.

AB Recent studies suggest that transport and water mass mixing may play a
   dominant role in controlling the distribution of dissolved rare earth
   element concentrations ([REE]) at least in parts of the North and South
   Atlantic and the Pacific Southern Ocean. Here we report vertically and
   spatially high-resolution profiles of dissolved REE concentrations
   ([REE]) along a NW-SE transect in the West Pacific and examine the
   processes affecting the [REE] distributions in this area. Surface water
   REE patterns reveal sources of trace element (TE) input near South Korea
   and in the tropical equatorial West Pacific. Positive europium anomalies
   and middle REE enrichments in surface and subsurface waters are
   indicative of TE input from volcanic islands and fingerprint in detail
   small-scale equatorial zonal eastward transport of TEs to the
   iron-limited tropical East Pacific. The low [REE] of North and South
   Pacific Tropical Waters and Antarctic Intermediate Water are a
   long-range (i.e., preformed) laterally advected signal, whereas
   increasing [REE] with depth within North Pacific Intermediate Water
   result from release from particles. Optimum multiparameter analysis of
   deep to bottom waters indicates a dominant control of lateral transport
   and mixing on [REE] at the depth of Lower Circumpolar Deep Water (>3000
   m water depth: 75-100% explained by water mass mixing), allowing the
   northward tracing of LCDW to 28 N in the Northwest Pacific. In contrast,
   scavenging in the hydrothermal plumes of the Lau Basin and Tonga-Fiji
   area at 1500-2000 m water depth leads to [REE] deficits (similar to
   40-60% removal) and marked REE fractionation in the tropical West
   Pacific. Overall, our data provide evidence for active trace element
   input both near South Korea and Papua New Guinea, and for a strong
   lateral transport component in the distribution of dissolved REEs in
   large parts of the West Pacific. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights

AB The Caribbean Island Biodiversity Hotspot is the largest insular system
   of the New World and a priority for biodiversity conservation worldwide.
   The tribe Adelieae (Euphorbiaceae) has over 35 species endemic to this
   hotspot, representing a prime example of speciation in the West Indies
   and involving taxa from Cuba, Hispaniola, Jamaica, and the Bahamas.
   These species form a monophyletic group and have traditionally been
   accommodated in two endemic genera, Lasiocroton and Leacocroton. A study
   based on scanning electron microscopy of pollen, macromorphology, and
   molecular analysis was conducted to reveal generic relationships within
   this group. Phylogenies were based on nucleotide sequences of the nrITS
   region and the non-coding cpDNA spacers psbM-trnD and ycf6-pcbM. Three
   major monophyletic assemblages were revealed; one of them is restricted
   to Hispaniola and is accommodated in a new genus, Garciadelia, with four
   species. The new genus is sister to a clade comprising two monophyletic
   groups, one including all species of Leucocroton and restricted to
   serpentine soils of Cuba, and a second including the species of
   Lasiocroton, occurring in Cuba, Hispaniola, Jamaica, and the Bahamas.
   Morphological, biogeographical, and ecological data provided additional
   support for each of these three monophyletic assemblages. Two new
   combinations (Lasiocroton microphyllus from Cuba, Garciadelia leprosa
   from Hispaniola) are made and four new species are described
   (Lasiocroton gutierrezii from Cuba, and Garciadelia abbottii, G.
   castilloae, and G. mejiae from Hispaniola).

   Symplectoscyphus johnstoni (Gray, 1843) tropicus Vervoort, 1993 is
   raised to species but, in order to avoid the secondary homonymy with Sy.
   tropicus (Hartlaub, 1901), the replacement name, Sy. fasciculatus nom.

   well as the female gonothecae of Salacia macer Vervoort & Watson, 2003,
   are described for the first time. Additional notes on the morphology of
   several other species are provided. All taxa are illustrated, in most

AB This paper reports on the marine biodiversity and ethnobiodiversity of
   Bellona, a small island in Solomon Islands inhabited by Polynesians who
   have, for centuries, depended on biodiversity for their own
   sustainability. The Bellonese have names for at least 8 whales and
   dolphins, 7 reptiles, over 500 finfish, 191 molluscs, 48 crustaceans, 29
   echinoderms and a range of corals, other invertebrates and marine
   plants, most of which have commercial, subsistence or cultural value. If
   conserved, this inheritance will continue to provide a foundation for
   continuing sustainability in a rapidly globalizing world. The paper
   highlights the importance of the preservation, and application to
   development, of ethnobiodiversity for food and subsistence security, and
   contingent issues of conservation and sustainability in small island
   developing states. As the current extinction crisis escalates globally,
   the rate of attrition of the intangible indigenous knowledge that has
   coevolved with this threatened biodiversity is probably far greater. In
   itself, the recording of information on biodiversity and related
   sustainable livelihoods is not sufficient to ensure sustainability.
   There is a vital need to integrate this into the formal education system
   and applied scientific activities at all levels to achieve the right
   balance between agriculture, wild harvest and trade, upon which
   sustainability and subsistence affluence still depend.
