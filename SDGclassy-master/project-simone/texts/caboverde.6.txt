The Government of Cabo Verde has elected energy security, price stability and reduction of the energy bill as cen- tral concerns, duly established in the PEDS, in line with SDGs 7, established measures to be taken through the Na- tional Program for Energy Sustainability aiming to make the transition to a se- cure, efficient and sustainable energy sector, reducing dependence on fossil fuels and ensuring universal access and energy security. The electricity access rate reached 90%, meaning only about 10 out of 100 people are in a situation of energy exclusion, belonging to the disadvantaged social strata and population of remote areas of Cabo Verde. Ensuring access to electrical power for all people is the goal of the Government of Cabo Verde in 2021. The Government approved the legal regime of the social tariff for electricity as a measure to protect consumers of electricity in situations of economic vulnerability. Energy efficiency is a challenge to be overcome, and the sector's resilience and sustainability conditions are still lacking, in particular this challenge can be overcome by combating the high level of non-technical losses and improving the operational efficiency of energy pro- duction, transportation and distribution. Cabo Verde's strategy is to increase the sector's resilience to external shocks by reducing energy dependence on imported fossil fuels, with the large- scale exploitation of renewable energy potential in the country. The production of renewable energy has made significant progress with a penetration rate of 16.9% in 2017 and the use of the great potential of endogenous renewable resources, notably the wind and solar component, is acknowledged as being strategic for reducing the electricity and water cost, increasing energy security and competitiveness and national economy diversity.
