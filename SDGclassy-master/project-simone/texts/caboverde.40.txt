The Government of Cabo Verde also acknowledges that social peace is one of the most important conditions to guarantee an environment of economic growth and sustainable development, based on predictability and the existence and compliance with clear and objective social relations rules. Social peace is inseparable from swift justice and juridical security, which is not compatible with the current situation of the slowness of justice. The problems of justice, the weakness of high-level political dialogue and the scrutiny of civil society, the insufficient legal in- formation on Cabo Verdean society, the relative inadequacy of the judicial assistance system, but also of the makeup of the judiciary, weak specialization of the various branches of justice, the relative delays in the penetration of information and communication technologies, but also, admittedly, the insufficiency of the judges, which is also exacerbated by their dedication to the tasks of court ad- ministration, the poor access of magistrates to specialized information, the need for reform of procedures to accelerate the process, but also the processes them- selves, the effective and consequent requirement of performance of magistrates, the recognized inadequacy of the system of execution of sentencing and non-recognition and non-adoption and application of voluntary mediation and arbitration. It is about these determinants that the Government of Cabo Verde commits that it will act through the Strategic Sustainable Development Plan, and therefore the Government will act on the determinants of peace through the Strategic Sustainable Development Plan.
