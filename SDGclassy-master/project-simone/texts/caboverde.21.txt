The country has made significant progress in the field of energy but significant challenges to be faced still persists. The access rate to electricity has reached 90.1%. In other words, only about 10 out of every 100 people are excluded, and they belong to the disadvantaged social strata and the population of remote areas of Cabo Verde. While the SDG 7 is 100% access by 2030 globally, Cabo Verde intends to reach this goal as early as 2021. However, in order to ensure actual access to electricity, in addition to physically extending the power grids, policies aimed at facilitating connection and ensuring price affordability need to be implemented, in order to make sure families do not commit too much of their income to the payment of electricity bills. The high cost of electricity constitutes a substantial burden on the expenses of vulnerable families.
