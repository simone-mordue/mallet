In Cabo Verde, the production units represent, in absolute terms, roughly 3.5 times the number of economic units and thus, those represent an important asset to the national economy, which suggests the creation of mechanisms to promote the formalization. The Government of Cabo Verde is aware that within the framework of the Sustainable Development Goals, the informal economy problem is gaining new impetus and aligns with the understanding of the international community in 104th International Work Conference session. High incidence of informal economy is a central challenge for workers' rights, including the fundamental principles and workersâ€™ rights, social protection, decent work, inclusive development and legal guarantees.
