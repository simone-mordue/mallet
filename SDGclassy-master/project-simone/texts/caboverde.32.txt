Cabo Verde is still a country with a high degree of economic vulnerability and low income compared to most small island economies. It needs to build an economy capable of sustainable and inclusive growth able to overcome some of its structural vulnerabilities: external dependence, inequality, unemployment, poverty and regional asymmetries. The country is determined to do so in harmony with its unique people, culture and environment.
