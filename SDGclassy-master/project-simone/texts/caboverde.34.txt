The demand for firewood to meet families' energy needs puts great pressure on the country's fragile vegetation coverage, with serious consequences for the environment such as desertification, soil degradation, reduction of rainwater retention capacity, degradation of the quality of life and health of the population. The use of these fuels diminishes opportunities for carrying out income generating activities, because women spend a considerable part of their available time looking for firewood and preparing food in inefficient stoves.
