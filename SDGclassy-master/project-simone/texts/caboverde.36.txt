Housing deficits and insecurity constitute an important dimension of poverty in terms of access to basic social ser- vices, especially for those in need of care as children of poor, elderly and disabled families, compounded by the weakening of traditional forms of social protection. Unpaid work represents close to 70% of the total workload in the country, meaning that the social effort and social contribution of families to social well-being and social cohesion is very high and falls mainly on women, but more than half of children and adolescents stay long periods of the day without adult supervision.
