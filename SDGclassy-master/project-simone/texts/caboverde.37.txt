Urban requalification is therefore one of the pressing needs and should be an area of concentration of public attention that requires international partnership. Cabo Verde is a country where the urbanization process, especially by African standards, is well advanced, with about 68% of the population currently living in the cities. Although there is no precise diagnosis of the total number of families and dwellings in the informal settlements of Cabo Verde, it is possible to conclude that this phenomenon is present in a large part of the cities of the country, especially those that show more dynamism in terms of urbanization and population growth.
