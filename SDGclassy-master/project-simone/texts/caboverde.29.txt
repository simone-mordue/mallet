In order to meet this principle of ensuring the statistical production required by the SDGs, it will be necessary to produce statistics with not only more de- tail, but with a frequency and regularity that is not compatible with the surveys carried out every five years and the censuses carried out every 10 years. Not leaving anyone behind requires the enhancement of geographical detail and social groups, which represent methodological challenges and makes statistics more expensive, as it poses questions of statistical secrecy. It requires access to micro-data to iso- late the cases that the averages may conceal, as an example, the population categories that were, or are, at risk of being left behind, and significantly increases the costs of statistical pro- duction.
