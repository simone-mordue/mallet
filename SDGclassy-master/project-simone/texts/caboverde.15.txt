recognizing that informality has a negative impact on the development of companies, in the collection of public revenue, in economic and environmental policies, the soundness of institutions and free competition, the Government of Cabo Verde understands that more than a problem, the informal economy is a challenge, and an opportunity, provided that there is the ability to undertake, to take risks, innovate, produce and be aware of market functioning. Thus, it created the Inter-institutional Commission for the Management of the Strategy of Transition of the Informal Economy to the Formal - GETIF, with the mission to identify the informality problem's specifics and to promote the conception and implementation of prompt and efficient solutions, to elaborate, to follow and to evaluate the inter-institutional agenda for the transition to for- mal economy.
