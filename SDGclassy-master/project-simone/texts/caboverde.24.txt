In addition to the Millennium Goals (almost fully achieved) and Sustainable Development Goals, the country and coastal territories must integrate the challenges of adaptation to climate changes. Cabo Verde is very vulnerable to climate change in particular in relation to (i) rainfall and drought, very damaging to agriculture and access to water, (ii) the evolution of fish catches and (iii) the rise in sea level that reinforces coastal risks of erosion and marine submersion in a country where 80% of the population resides on the coast. Until 2050, according to Lam et al. (2012), the changes in distribution and composition of marine species, particularly important in the tropical area, will have effects on the country's food safety. Simulations carried out by these authors calculate the reduction of catches in Cabo Verde EEZ by 6% or 22%, according to the emission scenarios (i.e. slightly below the average of West Africa that is 8% and 26%). This decrease will mainly cause effects on prices, export earnings and income from fisheries agreements due to a lower attractiveness of the EEZ.
