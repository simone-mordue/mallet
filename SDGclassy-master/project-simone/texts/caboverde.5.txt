Cabo Verde is a country that is excessively vulnerable to international circumstances, extremely vulnerable from a food perspective to agroclimate variations, but also to fluctuations in the external market. The food insecu- rity in Cabo Verde has a structural and multi-factorial nature and concerns the structural deficit of the national food production and the strong dependence on the international market, and the economic accessibility weaknesses. Strengthening the Food Security and Nutrition Information System (FSNIS) is a first-rate challenge. The National Strategy for Food Security for the 2020 horizon places greater emphasis on nutritional issues and the Human Right to Adequate Food (HRA) and its implementation in the context of good articulation and coordination between the various actors involved in food and nutrition security, will contribute to the achievement of SDGs 2. The Law on the Human Right to Adequate Food (HRA), the National School Feeding Program, the National Program for Agricultural Investment, Food and Nutrition Security for the period 2018-2022, the Single Social Registry, National Resilience Pri- orities (NRP / AGIR) of Cabo Verde and the project POSER-CLIMA are essential instruments of action to carry out this journey.
