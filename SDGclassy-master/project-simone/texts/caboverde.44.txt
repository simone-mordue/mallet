n Cabo Verde, real GDP per capita grew by 2.7% in 2017, continuing the trend started in 2016, a year in which it grew 2.6%, reversing the trend of previous years. The Cabo Verdean economy remains vulnerable to climate change and drought, remaining also the structural characteristics of subsistence farming, and this should be an important milestone of economic and environmental sustainability and in order to build its resilience it must take the front line of priorities. The annual rate of change in real GDP per person employed increased in 2017, after two years of decline, with the unemployment rate reaching 12.2% in 2017. Agriculture is the sector of activity that creates the most employment, followed by trade, except in periods of drought as was the case in 2017.
