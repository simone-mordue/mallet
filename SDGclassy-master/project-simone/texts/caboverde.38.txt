In alignment with United Nations guide- lines, the Government of Cabo Verde is drafting the Great Options of the Sustainable Development Strategic Plan for Tourism - GOPEDS-Tourism bearing in mind that sustainable development of tourism is based on five pillars, namely economic, social, environmental, cultural and peace, security and respect for the peoples. Round tables were held on sun and beach tourism, rural and nature tourism, urban, cultural and nautical tourism, regional tourism, tourism from the countryside of Santiago, meetings at the level of all the municipalities in the country, addressing the topic of local tourism development. A high-level meeting on the tourism development on the island of Maio has highlighted the importance of a balanced and sustained tourism development in the country, the need to address tourism on this island in a way that ensures a paradigm differentiation of the model in the neighbouring islands, form a quantity tourism to a higher quality tourism, with a strong environmental, social and cultural trademark. It is intended that Maio and the other islands of the country add to the sun and beach product, so precious to those who visit us, transition elements for a more diversified, eco- logical and population inclusive supple, which may be a pilot for the next tourist development of the other islands in the country. In this sense, the Government of Cabo Verde will proceed with the development of Tourism Master Plan by islands, starting with the island of Maio.
