Regarding water availability, it is affected by the hilly landscape, the dry climate, price which is on average high, high energy bill, but also because it is managed by operators that should ensure the cost recovery. after adopting the Integrated Water Resources Management Action Plan (Portuguese acronym: PAGIRE), the State of Cabo Verde has been reforming the water and sanitation sector in order to ensure that everyone has the right to water and to promote Cabo Verde's development through integrated improvement of water supply, sanitation and hygiene conditions, safeguarding the sustainable use of natural resources and the environment, as well as social and gender equity. In this context, the institutional framework of the sector was reviewed with the approval of the New Water and Sanitation Code, creation of the National Water and Sanitation Agency (Portuguese acronym: ANAS) and the National Water and Sanitation Council (Portuguese acronym: CNAS). The National Strategic Plan for Water and Sanitation (Portuguese acronym: PLENAS) was approved by the Council of Ministers' Resolution no. 10/2015, dated February 20.
