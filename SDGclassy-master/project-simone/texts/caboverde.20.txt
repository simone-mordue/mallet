The Government of Cabo Verde has approved the legal framework for the social energy tariff as a measure to protect economically vulnerable electricity consumers. The tariff comes into force before the end of this year. Cabo Verde still needs to meet the challenge of efficiency. That is, while the level of effectiveness of the power grid expansion strategy is satisfactory, there is still a need to build resilience and sustainability conditions in the sector, namely by combating the high level of non-technical losses and improving the operational efficiency of energy production, transportation and distribution.
