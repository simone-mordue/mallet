The SDGs are leading to the implementing countries of statistical burdens which are a major challenge, especially because of the principle of 'leaving no one behind', therefore, to meet this principle and ensure the statistical production that the SDG requires, the production of statistics with less frequency and greater regularity will be necessary. The National Statistical System has adopted the production of data for the follow-up of the PEDS and the SDGs as one of its strategic objectives, thus meeting the United Nations mandate on statistics production taking into account the indicators framework for the follow-up to the 2030 Agenda. The budget for the National Strategies for the Development of Statistics 2017-2021 is approximately US $23 million. It has large statistical operations in accordance with the internationally established periodicity, thus the Government of Cabo Verde urges the international community to take on the partnership necessary to enable NSDS 2017-2021's major priorities, so that Cabo Verde will continue to improve management development in order to "leave no one behind"; to follow the path of progress in the implementation of the SDGs, and to deepen its contribution to the development of statistics worldwide, in particular through the Praia Group of statistics on governance.
