Erosion and runoff have contributed to significant annual losses of arable land, leading to loss of soil fertility and endangering agricultural sustainability and food security. In order to combat degradation and to guarantee agricultural production, successive governments implemented in Brazil a vast program of soil and water conservation with the construction of mechanical and bio-logical structures for soil conservation and water harvesting). Some examples include landfills, vegetable hedges, large dams for water retention of surface water, catch dams, terraces, among others. Despite the positive impacts of the country's efforts to combat desertification and land degradation, land degradation and loss of soil quality prevail throughout the country, occurring in different forms and proportions. Degraded soils, with low organic matter content and, consequently, organic carbon, need to be restored and/ or rehabilitated through sustainable management so that they can contribute to the mitigation of cli- mate change.
