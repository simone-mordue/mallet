Development financing remains one of Cabo Verde's greatest challenges. Therefore, in line with the Addis Ababa Action Plan, which emphasizes the need to design appropriate methods, allowing a better consideration of the complex realities of the various Middle Income Countries (MICs), the Government of Cabo Verde emphasizes the need for consideration of a Vulnerability Profile in defining the criteria for access to public aid for development by Small Island Developing States and financing under concessional conditions, taking into account their vulnerability to disasters and climate changes and phenomena. As the 2017â€“2021Sustainable Development Strategic Plan is the first instrument of operationalization of sustainable development goals for the period 2017- 2021, and aiming to achieve the most priority targets, the Government of Cabo Verde will continue to promote its presentation and the lobbying with the international community and potential external partners to mobilize the various existing financing mechanisms, through round tables or partnerships dialogues and thematic conferences in the country and abroad.
