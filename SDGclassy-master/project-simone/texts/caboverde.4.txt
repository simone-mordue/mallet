As a Small Island Middle Income Country, Cabo Verde's biggest challenge is to build an economy with a high level of sustainable and inclusive growth, in order to overcome key constraints, structural vulnerabilities, external dependence, unemployment, poverty, inequality in income distribution, re- duced opportunities for emigration and consequent drop in remittances. Cabo Verde is confronted with natural vulner- abilities related to its volcanic origin, its island-made nature, its location in the Sahel region, scarcity of rainfall and lack of mineral resources. Moreover, its small territorial, demographic and economic size and its isolation from the African continent are characteristics that limit the real development possibilities.
