s Cabo Verde is an island low-middle income country, the effects and the impact of the climatic changes are more serious. Geographic dispersion is another vulnerability because the country is an archipelago of 10 islands, with a very steep and rugged terrain (in most islands) has extremely heavy effects on the costs of basic infrastructure, ser- vices and essential goods. The strategic location, the extension of the coastline and the exclusive economic zone make Cabo Verde particularly vulnerable to new threats, such as drug and human trafficking, illegal immigration and inter- national crime, and this constitutes its vulnerability to security. In the energy field, energy dependence is estimated at about 75% compared to the outside world.
