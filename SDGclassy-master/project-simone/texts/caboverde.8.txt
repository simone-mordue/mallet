As a result of the evaluation of the results in terms of achieving the MDGs, the national development strategies and the implementation of the SDGs, the challenge facing Cabo Verde is creating a favourable environment for the implementation of the transformation and the Sustainable Development Strategic Plan post-2015. The analysis of MDG progress pointed to the need for a development agenda that would consolidate the gains achieved while allowing a qualitative leap in development. Lessons learned from the achievement of the MDGs underscore the importance of investing in a permanent mechanism to track progress, fulfilment, and escape specific demand at key moments of analysis and accountability. The establishment and reinforcement of post-2015 SDGs monitoring mechanisms and capacities should be addressed from the outset in a small country context to ensure the continued health of national planning and to combine competing priorities that put pressure on the Public Administration, proportioned to the size of the country, with the availability of limited resources and capabilities.
