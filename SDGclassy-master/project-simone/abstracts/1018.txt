"1479" "POACHING WITH SNARES HAS BEEN IDENTIFIED AS THE MAIN CAUSE OF DECLINE OF THE ENDEMIC ROAN ANTELOPE HIPPOTRAGUS EQUINUS LANGHELDI IN RUMA NATIONAL PARK, KENYA, FROM > 200 IN 1979 TO 37 IN 2009. HOWEVER, THE SPATIAL SNARING PATTERNS IN THE PARK ARE NOT CLEARLY UNDERSTOOD. THE FOCUS OF OUR STUDY WAS TO MAP THE SPATIAL DISTRIBUTION OF SNARES IN THE PARK AND TO IDENTIFY THE FACTORS INFLUENCING THIS DISTRIBUTION, TO DEVELOP EFFECTIVE METHODS OF WILDLIFE PROTECTION. USING DATA COLLECTED FROM 56 SAMPLE PLOTS DURING 2006-2008, COUPLED WITH GEOGRAPHICAL INFORMATION SYSTEM TECHNIQUES, WE INVESTIGATED THE ASSOCIATION BETWEEN THE OCCURRENCE OF SNARES AND THE DISTRIBUTION OF GEOGRAPHICAL FEATURES (SLOPE, ELEVATION), INFRASTRUCTURE (ROADS, FENCES), ESSENTIAL RESOURCES FOR WILDLIFE (WATER, SALT LICKS, FORAGE), ROAN LOCATIONS AND WILDLIFE DENSITY. RIPLEY'S L FUNCTION FOR ASSESSING COMPLETE SPATIAL RANDOMNESS INDICATED THAT SNARES OCCURRED IN CLUMPS (HOTSPOTS) UP TO 4 KM APART. NEGATIVE BINOMIAL REGRESSION INDICATED THAT THESE HOTSPOTS OCCURRED (1) NEAR WATER RESOURCES, SALT LICKS AND THE PARK BOUNDARY, (2) FAR FROM ROAN LOCATIONS AND PARK ROADS, (3) IN AREAS WITH LOW GRADIENTS AND LOW WILDLIFE DENSITY, AND (4) IN AREAS WITH BURNED VEGETATION. WE RECOMMEND CONCENTRATING ROUTINE SECURITY PATROL EFFORTS AND RESOURCES ON SNARE HOTSPOTS TO REDUCE SNARING AND TO PROTECT THE ROAN ANTELOPE AND OTHER THREATENED WILDLIFE.
