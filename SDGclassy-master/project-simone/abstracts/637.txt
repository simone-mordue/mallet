"725" "HERITAGE GARDENS, HEATHLAND AND WOODLAND ARE INCREASINGLY UNDER THREAT FROM THE NON-NATIVE TREE AND PLANT DISEASES PHYTOPHTHORA RAMORUM AND PHYTOPHTHORA KERNOVIAE. HOWEVER, THERE EXIST ONLY LIMITED LITERATURE THAT ESTIMATES THE PUBLIC NON-MARKET VALUE THAT MAY BE LOST FROM A CONTINUED SPREAD OF PHYTOPHTHORA RAMORUM AND PHYTOPHTHORA KERNOVIAE INTO THESE HABITATS. THIS PAPER THEREFORE USES A CONTINGENT VALUATION SURVEY TO ASSESS THE NON-EXTRACTIVE PUBLIC USE AND NON-USE VALUES AT RISK FROM AN UNCONTROLLED SPREAD OF THESE DISEASES IN ENGLAND AND WALES. RESULTS ESTIMATE THAT 1.446BN OF PUBLIC VALUE IS AT RISK IN ENGLAND AND WALES PER YEAR FROM AN UNCONTROLLED SPREAD OF PHYTOPHTHORA RAMORUM AND PHYTOPHTHORA KERNOVIAE. THE GREATEST PUBLIC VALUE AT RISK, OF 578M/YEAR, IS FROM AN UNCONTROLLED SPREAD OF THESE DISEASES TO HERITAGE GARDENS, WHILE THE LOWEST PUBLIC VALUE AT RISK, OF 386M/YEAR, IS FROM DISEASE SPREAD TO HEATHLAND. THE FINDINGS OF THIS PAPER SHOULD HELP POLICYMAKERS MAKE INFORMED DECISIONS AS TO THE PUBLIC RESOURCES TO DEDICATE TOWARDS PHYTOPHTHORA RAMORUM AND PHYTOPHTHORA KERNOVIAE CONTROL IN ENGLAND AND WALES. IN THIS REGARD, THE CURRENT CONTROL PROGRAMME TO CONTAIN THESE DISEASES APPEARS COST-EFFECTIVE IN LIGHT OF THE PUBLIC VALUE AT RISK ESTIMATES PRODUCED BY THIS PAPER. 2017 ELSEVIER LTD" "PUBLIC VALUE AT RISK FROM PHYTOPHTHORA RAMORUM AND PHYTOPHTHORA KERNOVIAE SPREAD IN ENGLAND AND WALES" "CONTINGENT VALUATION; ECOSYSTEM SERVICES; HERITAGE GARDENS; TREE DISEASE; WILLINGNESS TO PAY"
