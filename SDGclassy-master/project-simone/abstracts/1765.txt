SUCH ENZYMES CONTRIBUTE TO PLANT CELL-WALL ASSEMBLY AND/OR RE-STRUCTURING. WE SOUGHT A GENERAL METHOD FOR REVEALING NOVEL HOMO- AND HETERO-TRANSGLYCANASES, APPLICABLE TO DIVERSE POLYSACCHARIDES AND OLIGOSACCHARIDES, SEPARATING TRANSGLYCANASE-GENERATED 3H-POLYSACCHARIDES FROM UNREACTED 3H-OLIGOSACCHARIDES-THE FORMER IMMOBILIZED (ON FILTER-PAPER, SILICA-GEL OR GLASS-FIBER), THE LATTER ELUTED. ON FILTER-PAPER, CERTAIN POLYSACCHARIDES [E.G. (13, 14)--D-GLUCANS] REMAINED SATISFACTORILY ADSORBED WHEN WATER-WASHED, OTHERS (E.G. PECTINS) WERE PARTIALLY LOST. MANY OLIGOSACCHARIDES (E.G. ARABINAN-, GALACTAN-, XYLOGLUCAN-BASED) WERE SUCCESSFULLY ELUTED IN APPROPRIATE SOLVENTS, BUT OTHERS (E.G. [3H]XYLOHEXAITOL, [3H]MANNOHEXAITOL [3H]CELLOHEXAITOL) REMAINED IMMOBILE. ON SILICA-GEL, ALL 3H-OLIGOSACCHARIDES LEFT AN IMMOBILE 'GHOST' SPOT (CONTAMINATING ANY 3H-POLYSACCHARIDES), WHICH WAS DIMINISHED BUT NOT PREVENTED BY ADDITIVES E.G. SUCROSE OR TRITON X-100. THE BEST STRATUM WAS GLASS-FIBER (GF), ONTO WHICH THE REACTION-MIXTURE WAS DRIED THEN WASHED IN 75% ETHANOL. WASHING LED TO MINIMAL LOSS OR LATERAL MIGRATION OF 3H-POLYSACCHARIDES IF CONDUCTED BY SLOW PERCOLATION OF ACIDIFIED ETHANOL. THE EFFECTIVENESS OF GF-BLOTTING WAS WELL DEMONSTRATED FOR CHARA VULGARIS TRANS--MANNANASE. IN CONCLUSION, OUR NOVEL GF-BLOTTING TECHNIQUE EFFICIENTLY FREES TRANSGLYCANASE-GENERATED 3H-POLYSACCHARIDES FROM UNREACTED 3H-OLIGOSACCHARIDES, ENABLING HIGH-THROUGHPUT SCREENING OF MULTIPLE POSTULATED TRANSGLYCANASE ACTIVITIES UTILISING CHEMICALLY DIVERSE DONOR- AND ACCEPTOR-SUBSTRATES. 2015 INSTITUTE OF BOTANY, CHINESE ACADEMY OF SCIENCES."
