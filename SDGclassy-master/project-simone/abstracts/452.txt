"241" "DENDRITIC POLYGLYCEROLS (PGS) WERE GRAFTED ONTO SURFACES USING A RING-OPENING POLYMERIZATION REACTION, AND THE FOULING-RELEASE PROPERTIES AGAINST MARINE ORGANISMS WERE DETERMINED. THE COATINGS WERE CHARACTERIZED BY SPECTROSCOPIC ELLIPSOMETRY, CONTACT ANGLE GONIOMETRY, ATR-FTIR, AND STABILITY TESTS IN DIFFERENT AQUEOUS MEDIA. A HIGH RESISTANCE TOWARD THE ATTACHMENT OF DIFFERENT PROTEINS WAS FOUND. THE PG COATINGS WITH THREE DIFFERENT THICKNESSES WERE TESTED IN A LABORATORY ASSAY AGAINST THE DIATOM NAVICULA INCERTA AND IN A FIELD ASSAY USING A ROTATING DISK. UNDER STATIC CONDITIONS, THE PG COATINGS DID NOT INHIBIT THE INITIAL ATTACHMENT OF DIATOMS, BUT UP TO 94% OF ATTACHED DIATOMS COULD BE REMOVED FROM THE COATINGS AFTER EXPOSURE TO A SHEAR STRESS OF 19 PA. FOULING RELEASE WAS FOUND TO BE ENHANCED IF THE COATINGS WERE SUFFICIENTLY THICK. THE EXCELLENT FOULING-RELEASE PROPERTIES WERE SUPPORTED IN DYNAMIC FIELD-IMMERSION EXPERIMENTS IN WHICH THE SAMPLES WERE CONTINUALLY EXPOSED TO A SHEAR STRESS OF 0.18 PA. 2018 AMERICAN CHEMICAL SOCIETY."
