"412" "A NOVEL, NON-MOTILE, COCCOID, GRAM-STAIN-POSITIVE ACTINOBACTERIUM, DESIGNATED BMG 862 T , WAS ISOLATED FROM A MARBLE SAMPLE COLLECTED FROM THE BULLA REGIA MONUMENT, NORTHERN TUNISIA. ITS TAXONOMIC POSITION WAS DETERMINED USING A POLYPHASIC APPROACH. RESULTS FROM CHEMOTAXONOMIC ANALYSES SHOWED MK-9(H 4 ), MK-8(H 4 ) AND MK-9(H 2 ) AS THE PREDOMINANT MENAQUINONES. THE MAJOR POLAR LIPIDS COMPRISED DIPHOSPHATIDYLGLYCEROL, PHOSPHATIDYLCHOLINE, PHOSPHATIDYLETHANOLAMINE, PHOSPHATIDYLINOSITOL, GLYCOPHOSPHATIDYLINOSITOL, HYDROXY-PHOSPHATIDYLETHANOLAMINE AND THREE UNIDENTIFIED PHOSPHOLIPIDS. THE FATTY ACIDS CONSISTED OF SIGNIFICANT AMOUNTS (10%) OF ISO-C 16:0 , C 17:1 8C, ISO-C 15:0 AND C 16:1 7C. PHYLOGENETIC ANALYSIS ON THE BASIS OF 16S RRNA GENE SEQUENCE COMPARISONS SHOWED THAT STRAIN BMG 862 T BELONGS TO THE GENUS BLASTOCOCCUS, BEING MOST CLOSELY RELATED TO BLASTOCOCCUS SAXOBSIDENS (=DSM 44509 T ) (99.5%) AND BLASTOCOCCUS CAPSENSIS (=DSM 46835 T =CECT 8876 T ) (99.3%). THE GENOMIC DNA G+C CONTENT OF THE ORGANISM WAS 74.7 MOL%. RESULTS OF DNA-DNA HYBRIDIZATION AND PHYSIOLOGICAL TESTS ALLOWED DIFFERENTIATION OF STRAIN BMG 862 T FROM RELATED SPECIES. THE STRAIN WAS ALSO CHARACTERIZED BY ITS ABILITY TO HYDROLYSE XANTHINE. ON THE BASIS OF PHENOTYPIC AND MOLECULAR CHARACTERISTICS, STRAIN BMG 862 T (=DSM 46842 T =CECT 8884 T ) REPRESENTS THE TYPE STRAIN OF A NOVEL SPECIES OF THE GENUS BLASTOCOCCUS, FOR WHICH THE NAME BLASTOCOCCUS XANTHINILYTICUS SP. NOV. IS PROPOSED. 2018 IUMS." "BLASTOCOCCUS XANTHINILYTICUS SP. NOV., ISOLATED FROM MONUMENT" "GEODERMATOPHILACEAE; POLYPHASIC TAXONOMY; XANTHINE HYDROLASE"
