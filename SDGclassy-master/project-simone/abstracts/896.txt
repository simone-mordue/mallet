"803" "NAKAMURELLA LACTEA DLS-10T, ISOLATED FROM ROCK IN KOREA, IS ONE OF THE FOUR TYPE STRAINS OF THE GENUS NAKAMURELLA. IN THIS STUDY, WE DESCRIBE THE HIGH QUALITY DRAFT GENOME OF N. LACTEA DLS-10T AND ITS ANNOTATION. A SUMMARY OF PHENOTYPIC DATA COLLECTED FROM PREVIOUSLY PUBLISHED STUDIES WAS ALSO INCLUDED. THE GENOME OF STRAIN DLS-10T PRESENTS A SIZE OF 5.82 MPB, 5100 PROTEIN CODING GENES, AND A C + G CONTENT OF 68.9%. BASED ON THE GENOME ANALYSIS, EMENDED DESCRIPTION OF N. LACTEA IN TERMS OF G + C CONTENT WAS ALSO PROPOSED. 2017 THE AUTHOR(S)."
