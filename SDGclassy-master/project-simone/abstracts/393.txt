"1879" "COLD-WATER CORAL CARBONATE MOUNDS, FORMED BY FRAMEWORK BUILDING COLD-WATER CORALS, ARE FOUND IN SEVERAL MOUND PROVINCES ON THE IRISH MARGIN. DIFFERENCES IN COLD-WATER CORAL MOUND DEVELOPMENT RATES AND SEDIMENT COMPOSITION BETWEEN MOUNDS AT THE SOUTHWEST ROCKALL TROUGH MARGIN AND THE GALWAY MOUND IN THE PORCUPINE SEABIGHT ARE INVESTIGATED. VARIATIONS IN SEDIMENT COMPOSITION IN THE TWO MOUND PROVINCES ARE RELATED TO THE LOCAL ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITIONS AND SEDIMENT SOURCES. MOUND ACCUMULATION RATES ARE POSSIBLY HIGHER AT THE GALWAY MOUND PROBABLY DUE TO A HIGHER INFLUX OF HEMIPELAGIC FINE GRAINED NON-CARBONATE SEDIMENTS. IN BOTH COLD-WATER CORAL MOUND AREAS, MOUND GROWTH HAS BEEN CONTINUOUS FOR THE LAST CA 11,000 YEARS, BEFORE THIS PERIOD SEVERAL HIATUSES AND UNCONFORMITIES EXIST IN THE MOUND RECORD. THE MOST RECENT UNCONFORMITY CAN BE CORRELATED ACROSS MULTIPLE MOUNDS AND MOUND PROVINCES AT THE IRISH MARGIN ON THE BASIS OF APPARENT AGE. ON THE SOUTHWEST ROCKALL TROUGH MARGIN THESE HIATUSES/UNCONFORMITIES ARE ASSOCIATED WITH POST-DEPOSITIONAL ARAGONITE DISSOLUTION IN, AND LITHIFICATION OF, CERTAIN INTERVALS, WHILE AT GALWAY MOUND NO LITHIFICATION OCCURS. THIS STUDY REVEALED THAT THE INFLUX AND TYPES OF MATERIAL TRANSPORTED TO COLD-WATER CORAL MOUNDS MAY HAVE A DIRECT IMPACT ON THE CARBONATE MOUND ACCUMULATION RATE AND ON POST-DEPOSITIONAL PROCESSES. SIGNIFICANTLY, THE LOGACHEV MOUNDS ON THE SW ROCKALL TROUGH MARGIN ACCUMULATE SLOWER BUT, BECAUSE THEY CONTAIN LITHIFIED LAYERS, ARE LESS SUSCEPTIBLE TO EROSION. THIS NET EFFECT MAY ACCOUNT FOR THEIR LARGER SIZE COMPARED TO THE BELGICA MOUNDS. 2013 ELSEVIER LTD."
