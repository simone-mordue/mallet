"1671" "A NUMBER OF ORGANISMS IS ROUTINELY USED IN LABORATORY ASSAYS (I) TO ENABLE THE DOWN-SELECTION OF COATING LIBRARIES AND (II) TO TEST HYPOTHESES IN RELATION TO SETTLEMENT/ADHESION ON MODEL/PRACTICAL SURFACES. SETTLEMENT AND FOULING-RELEASE ASSAYS ARE DESCRIBED FOR BACTERIA, ALGAE AND BARNACLES. THIS CHAPTER FOCUSES ON THOSE THAT HAVE BEEN MODIFIED OR DEVELOPED FOR EVALUATING A WIDE RANGE OF NONBIOCIDAL COATING TECHNOLOGIES, PARTICULARLY IN PROGRAMS SUPPORTED BY THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION AND THE US OFFICE OF NAVAL RESEARCH. THESE PROGRAMS HAVE NECESSITATED BIOASSAY METHODS THAT CAN BE APPLIED TO LARGE NUMBERS OF SAMPLES PROVIDED BY CHEMISTS AND POLYMER SCIENTISTS. THE MAIN TEST ORGANISMS THAT HAVE BEEN USED FOR TESTING THE ANTIFOULING EFFICACY OF NONBIOCIDAL AND FOULING-RELEASE COATINGS ARE BARNACLES, ESPECIALLY BALANUS AMPHITRITE , THE GREEN MACROALGA ULVA AND DIATOMS. 2014 BY JOHN WILEY & SONS, LTD.
