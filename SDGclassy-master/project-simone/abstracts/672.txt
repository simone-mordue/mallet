"667" "IMPACTS OF MOBILE FISHING GEARS ON HABITAT AND BENTHOS HAVE BEEN WELL-DOCUMENTED, IN CONTRAST, LESS STUDIED PHYSICAL IMPACTS OF STATIC FISHING GEAR ON BENTHIC HABITATS ARE STILL DEBATED. POT FISHING, IS A GROWING SECTOR IN THE UK AND EVIDENCE OF ANY IMPACTS IS NEEDED TO INFORM MANAGEMENT. THIS STUDY SIMULATED HIGH INTENSITY EXPERIMENTAL POT FISHING ON THE EPIBENTHOS OF TWO COMMON UK REEF HABITATS IN NORTHUMBERLAND, UK. SINGLE TETHERED POTS WERE FISHED IN INTENSIVELY AND LIGHTLY FISHED AREAS OVER THE COURSE OF 2 MONTHS. WITHIN EACH AREA, THREE EXPERIMENTAL SITES AND CONTROL SITES WERE SURVEYED BEFORE AND AFTER FISHING USING PHOTOQUADRATS (N=240 PER 290 M2 SITE) COLLECTED BY SCUBA DIVERS. PERMANOVA ANALYSIS INDICATED NO EVIDENCE OF EPIBENTHIC SPECIES ABUNDANCES DECREASING DUE TO PHYSICAL CRUSHING OR ABRASION FROM POTTING ON EITHER INTENSIVELY OR LIGHTLY FISHED REEFS. A SHIFT IN COMMUNITY COMPOSITION OVER TIME WAS DETECTED BUT WAS ATTRIBUTED TO NATURAL CHANGE AS EPIBENTHOS IN CONTROL SITES SHIFTED SIMILARLY. EXPERIMENTAL POT IMPACTS FAR EXCEEDED THOSE OF THE LOCAL COMMERCIAL POT FISHERY, PROVIDING RELEVANT EVIDENCE FOR STATUTORY GOVERNING BODIES REVISITING CURRENT FISHERIES MANAGEMENT. RESULTS ARE APPLICABLE ACROSS WESTERN EUROPE DUE TO THE SELECTION OF HABITATS WITH ABUNDANT AND COMMONLY DISTRIBUTED BENTHIC SPECIES. INTERNATIONAL COUNCIL FOR THE EXPLORATION OF THE SEA 2017.
