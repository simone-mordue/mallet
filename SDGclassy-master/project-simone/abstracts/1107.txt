THE SCHIFF BASE AND COPPER(I) COMPLEX HAVE BEEN CHARACTERIZED BY ELEMENTAL ANALYSES, IR, ELECTRONIC AND 1H NMR SPECTROSCOPY, AND X-RAY CRYSTALLOGRAPHY [FROM SYNCHROTRON DATA FOR (1)]. THE MOLECULE OF (1) LIES ON A CRYSTALLOGRAPHIC INVERSION CENTRE, WITH A TRANS CONFORMATION FOR THE ETHYLENEDIAMINE UNIT, AND DISPLAYS SIGNIFICANT TWISTS FROM COPLANARITY OF ITS NITRO GROUP, AROMATIC RING, CONJUGATED CHAIN AND ESPECIALLY ETHYLENEDIAMINE SEGMENTS. IT ACTS AS A BIDENTATE LIGAND COORDINATING VIA THE IMINE N ATOMS TO THE CUI ATOM IN COMPLEX (2), IN WHICH THE ETHYLENEDIAMINE UNIT NECESSARILY ADOPTS A SOMEWHAT FLATTENED GAUCHE CONFORMATION, RESULTING IN A RATHER BOWED SHAPE OVERALL FOR THE LIGAND. THE NCS- LIGAND IS COORDINATED THROUGH ITS N ATOM. THE GEOMETRY AROUND THE CUI ATOM IS DISTORTED TETRAHEDRAL, WITH A SMALL N-CU-N BITE ANGLE OF 81.56(12) AND AN ENLARGED OPPOSITE ANGLE OF 117.29(9) FOR SCN-CU-P. COMPARISONS ARE MADE WITH THE ANALOGOUS SCHIFF BASE HAVING NO NITRO SUBSTITUENTS AND WITH METAL COMPLEXES OF BOTH LIGANDS. 2015 INTERNATIONAL UNION OF CRYSTALLOGRAPHY."
