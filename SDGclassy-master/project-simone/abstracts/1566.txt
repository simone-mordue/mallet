"1917" "THE ROLES OF NON-CELLULOSIC POLYSACCHARIDES IN COTTON FIBER DEVELOPMENT ARE POORLY UNDERSTOOD. COMBINING GLYCAN MICROARRAYS AND IN SITU ANALYSES WITH MONOCLONAL ANTIBODIES, POLYSACCHARIDE LINKAGE ANALYSES AND TRANSCRIPT PROFILING, THE OCCURRENCE OF HETEROMANNAN AND HETEROXYLAN POLYSACCHARIDES AND RELATED GENES IN DEVELOPING AND MATURE COTTON (GOSSYPIUM SPP.) FIBERS HAS BEEN DETERMINED. COMPARATIVE ANALYSES ON COTTON FIBERS AT SELECTED DAYS POST-ANTHESIS INDICATE DIFFERENT TEMPORAL AND SPATIAL REGULATION OF HETEROMANNAN AND HETEROXYLAN DURING FIBER DEVELOPMENT. THE LM21 HETEROMANNAN EPITOPE WAS MORE ABUNDANT DURING THE FIBER ELONGATION PHASE AND LOCALIZED MAINLY IN THE PRIMARY CELL WALL. IN CONTRAST, THE AX1 HETEROXYLAN EPITOPE OCCURRED AT THE TRANSITION PHASE AND DURING SECONDARY CELL WALL DEPOSITION, AND LOCALIZED IN BOTH THE PRIMARY AND THE SECONDARY CELL WALLS OF THE COTTON FIBER. THESE DEVELOPMENTAL DYNAMICS WERE SUPPORTED BY TRANSCRIPT PROFILING OF BIOSYNTHETIC GENES. WHEREAS OUR DATA SUGGEST A ROLE FOR HETEROMANNAN IN FIBER ELONGATION, HETEROXYLAN IS LIKELY TO BE INVOLVED IN THE REGULATION OF CELLULOSE DEPOSITION OF SECONDARY CELL WALLS. IN ADDITION, THE RELATIVE ABUNDANCE OF THESE EPITOPES DURING FIBER DEVELOPMENT VARIED BETWEEN COTTON LINES WITH CONTRASTING FIBER CHARACTERISTICS FROM FOUR SPECIES (G. HIRSUTUM, G. BARBADENSE, G. ARBOREUM AND G. HERBACEUM), SUGGESTING THAT THESE NON-CELLULOSIC POLYSACCHARIDES MAY BE INVOLVED IN DETERMINING FINAL FIBER QUALITY AND SUITABILITY FOR INDUSTRIAL PROCESSING. 2015 THE AUTHOR 2015."
