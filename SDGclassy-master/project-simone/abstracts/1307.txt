"1383" "THE APPARENT REDUCTION OF SOLITARY AND PRIMITIVELY EUSOCIAL BEES POPULATIONS HAS REMAINED A HUGE CONCERN OVER THE PAST FEW DECADES AND URBANISATION IS CONSIDERED AS ONE OF THE FACTORS AFFECTING BEES AT DIFFERENT SCALES DEPENDING ON BEE GUILD. AS URBANISATION IS INCREASING GLOBALLY IT NECESSITATES MORE RESEARCH TO UNDERSTAND THE COMPLEX COMMUNITY DYNAMICS OF SOLITARY AND PRIMITIVELY EUSOCIAL BEES IN URBAN SETTINGS. WE INVESTIGATED THE URBAN CORE OF A BRITISH TOWN FOR DIVERSITY AND ABUNDANCE OF SOLITARY BEES USING STANDARDIZED METHODS, AND COMPARED THE RESULTS WITH NEARBY MEADOWS AND NATURE RESERVES. THE STUDY RECORDED 48 SPECIES WITHIN THE TOWN, ABOUT 22% OF THE TOTAL SPECIES AND 58% OF THE GENERA OF SOLITARY BEES IN THE UNITED KINGDOM. FURTHERMORE WE FOUND THE URBAN CORE TO BE MORE DIVERSE AND ABUNDANT IN SOLITARY AND PRIMITIVELY EUSOCIAL BEES COMPARED TO THE MEADOWS AND NATURE RESERVES. OF PARTICULAR NOTE WAS AN URBAN RECORD OF THE NATIONALLY RARE RED DATA BOOK SPECIES COELIOXYS QUADRIDENTATA AND ITS HOST ANTHOPHORA QUADRIMACULATA. THIS RESEARCH DEMONSTRATES THAT URBAN SETTINGS CAN CONTRIBUTE SIGNIFICANTLY TO THE CONSERVATION OF SOLITARY AND PRIMITIVELY EUSOCIAL BEES IN BRITAIN. 2015, SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING SWITZERLAND."
