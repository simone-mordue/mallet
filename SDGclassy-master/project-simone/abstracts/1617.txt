"226" "THE TAXONOMIC PROVENANCE OF A FILAMENTOUS ACTINOBACTERIAL STRAIN ISOLATED FROM A DESERT SOIL WAS ESTABLISHED USING A POLYPHASIC APPROACH. THE STRAIN HAS CHEMOTAXONOMIC AND MORPHOLOGICAL PROPERTIES CONSISTENT WITH ITS CLASSIFICATION IN THE GENUS SACCHAROTHRIX. IT FORMS A DISTINCT BRANCH IN THE SACCHAROTHRIX 16S RRNA GENE TREE, RELATED TO THE TYPE STRAIN OF SACCHAROTHRIX SAHARENSIS (96.7%) BUT WAS DISTINGUISHED READILY FROM IT USING A COMBINATION OF PHENOTYPIC PROPERTIES. THE GENOTYPIC AND PHENOTYPIC DATA SHOW THAT THE STRAIN REPRESENTS A NOVEL SPECIES IN THE GENUS SACCHAROTHRIX, FOR WHICH THE NAME SACCHAROTHRIX THARENSIS SP. NOV. IS PROPOSED WITH THE TYPE STRAIN TD-093T (= KCTC 39724T=MCC 2832T). 2018, SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG, PART OF SPRINGER NATURE." "SACCHAROTHRIX THARENSIS SP.
