"710" "AN INCREASED BRONCHOCONSTRICTOR RESPONSE IS A HALLMARK IN THE PROGRESSION OF OBSTRUCTIVE AIRWAY DISEASES. ACETYLCHOLINE AND 5-HYDROXYTRYPTAMINE (5-HT, SEROTONIN) ARE THE MAJOR BRONCHOCONSTRICTORS. THERE IS EVIDENCE THAT BOTH CHOLINERGIC AND SEROTONERGIC SIGNALING IN AIRWAY SMOOTH MUSCLE (ASM) INVOLVE CAVEOLAE. WE HYPOTHESIZED THAT CAVEOLIN-1 (CAV-1), A STRUCTURAL PROTEIN OF CAVEOLAE, PLAYS AN IMPORTANT REGULATORY ROLE IN ASM CONTRACTION. WE ANALYZED AIRWAY CONTRACTION IN DIFFERENT TRACHEAL SEGMENTS AND EXTRA- AND INTRAPULMONARY BRONCHI IN CAV-1 DEFICIENT (CAV-1-/-) AND WILD-TYPE MICE USING ORGAN BATH RECORDINGS AND VIDEOMORPHOMETRY OF METHYL-BETA-CYCLODEXTRIN (MCD) TREATED AND NON-TREATED PRECISION-CUT LUNG SLICES (PCLS). THE PRESENCE OF CAVEOLAE WAS INVESTIGATED BY ELECTRON MICROSCOPY. RECEPTOR SUBTYPES DRIVING 5-HT-RESPONSES WERE STUDIED BY RT-PCR AND VIDEOMORPHOMETRY AFTER PHARMACOLOGICAL INHIBITION WITH KETANSERIN. CAV-1 WAS PRESENT IN TRACHEAL EPITHELIUM AND ASM. MUSCARINE INDUCED A DOSE DEPENDENT CONTRACTION IN ALL AIRWAY SEGMENTS. A SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER EMAX WAS OBSERVED IN THE CAUDAL TRACHEA. ALTHOUGH, CAVEOLAE ABUNDANCY WAS LARGELY REDUCED IN CAV-1-/- MICE, MUSCARINE-INDUCED AIRWAY CONTRACTION WAS MAINTAINED, ALBEIT AT DIMINISHED POTENCY IN THE MIDDLE TRACHEA, IN THE CAUDAL TRACHEA AND IN THE BRONCHUS WITHOUT CHANGES IN THE MAXIMUM EFFICACY. MCD-TREATMENT OF PLCS FROM CAV-1-/- MICE REDUCED CHOLINERGIC CONSTRICTION BY ABOUT 50%, INDICATING THAT CHOLESTEROL-RICH PLASMA DOMAINS ACCOUNT FOR A SUBSTANTIAL PORTION OF THE MUSCARINE-INDUCED BRONCHOCONSTRICTION. NOTABLY, CAV-1-DEFICIENCY FULLY ABROGATED 5-HT-INDUCED CONTRACTION OF EXTRAPULMONARY AIRWAYS. IN CONTRAST, 5-HT-INDUCED BRONCHOCONSTRICTION WAS FULLY MAINTAINED IN CAV-1-DEFICIENT INTRAPULMONARY BRONCHI, BUT DESENSITIZATION UPON REPETITIVE STIMULATION WAS ENHANCED. RT-PCR ANALYSIS REVEALED 5-HT1B, 5-HT2A, 5-HT6, AND 5-HT7 RECEPTORS AS THE MOST PREVALENT SUBTYPES IN THE AIRWAYS. THE 5-HT-INDUCED-CONSTRICTION IN PCLS COULD BE ANTAGONIZED BY KETANSERIN, A 5-HT2A RECEPTOR INHIBITOR. IN CONCLUSION, THE ROLE OF CAV-1, CAVEOLAE, AND CHOLESTEROL-RICH PLASMA DOMAINS IN REGULATION OF AIRWAY TONE ARE HIGHLY AGONIST-SPECIFIC AND DEPENDENT ON AIRWAY LEVEL. CAV-1 IS INDISPENSABLE FOR SEROTONERGIC CONTRACTION OF EXTRAPULMONARY AIRWAYS AND MODULATES CHOLINERGIC CONSTRICTION OF THE TRACHEA AND MAIN BRONCHUS. THUS, CAV-1/CAVEOLAE SHALL BE CONSIDERED IN SETTINGS SUCH AS BRONCHIAL HYPERREACTIVITY IN COMMON AIRWAY DISEASES AND MIGHT PROVIDE AN OPPORTUNITY FOR MODULATION OF THE CONSTRICTOR RESPONSE. 2017 KESHAVARZ, SCHWARZ, HARTMANN, WIEGAND, SKILL, ALTHAUS, KUMMER AND KRASTEVA-CHRIST."
