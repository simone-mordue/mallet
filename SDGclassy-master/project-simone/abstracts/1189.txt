THE MAIN OBJECTIVE OF THIS STUDY IS TO INVESTIGATE THE HYPOTHESIS THAT INDIVIDUALS HAVE GREATER RELATIVE PREFERENCES FOR THE ENVIRONMENTAL BENEFITS ASSOCIATED WITH AGRI-ENVIRONMENT SCHEMES WHEN THEY ARE DELIVERED WITHIN THOSE LANDSCAPES CLOSEST TO WHERE THEY LIVE. A CHOICE EXPERIMENT APPROACH BASED ON A NATIONAL SURVEY PROVIDES THE DATA AND A MIXED LOGIT APPROACH IS USED TO MODEL RELATIVE PREFERENCES FOR THE ENVIRONMENTAL BENEFITS OF ES ACROSS FIVE GENERIC LANDSCAPE TYPES. RESULTS SHOW THAT MOST RESPONDENTS HAVE A PREFERENCE FOR BENEFITS DELIVERED IN THOSE AREAS CLOSEST AND MOST ACCESSIBLE TO WHERE THEY LIVE. 2013 THE AGRICULTURAL ECONOMICS SOCIETY."
