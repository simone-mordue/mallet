"618" "CHARDONNAY GRAPE POMACE WAS TREATED WITH PRESSURIZED HEAT FOLLOWED BY ENZYMATIC HYDROLYSIS, WITH COMMERCIAL OR PURE ENZYMES, IN BUFFERED CONDITIONS. THE POMACE WAS UNFERMENTED AS COMMONLY FOUND FOR WHITE WINEMAKING WASTES AND TREATMENTS AIMED TO SIMULATE BIOVALORIZATION PROCESSING. CELL WALL PROFILING TECHNIQUES SHOWED THAT THE PRETREATMENT LED TO DEPECTINATION OF THE OUTER LAYERS THEREBY EXPOSING XYLAN POLYMERS AND INCREASING THE EXTRACTABILITY OF ARABINANS, GALACTANS, ARABINOGALACTAN PROTEINS AND MANNANS. THIS HIGHER EXTRACTABILITY IS BELIEVED TO BE LINKED WITH PARTIAL DEGRADATION AND OPENING-UP OF CELL WALL NETWORKS. PECTINASE-RICH ENZYME PREPARATIONS WERE PRESUMABLY ABLE TO ACCESS THE INNER RHAMNOGALACTURONAN I DOMINANT COATING LAYERS DUE TO THE HYDROTHERMAL PRETREATMENT. PATTERNS OF EPITOPE ABUNDANCE AND THE SEQUENTIAL RELEASE OF CELL WALL POLYMERS WITH SPECIFIC COMBINATIONS OF ENZYMES LED TO A WORKING MODEL OF THE HITHERTO, POORLY UNDERSTOOD INNERMOST XYLOGLUCAN-RICH HEMICELLULOSE LAYERS OF UNFERMENTED GRAPE POMACE. 2017 ELSEVIER LTD" "COMBINING HYDROTHERMAL PRETREATMENT WITH ENZYMES DE-PECTINATES AND EXPOSES THE INNERMOST XYLOGLUCAN-RICH HEMICELLULOSE LAYERS OF WINE GRAPE POMACE" "CELL WALL; ENZYMES; GRAPE POMACE; PRETREATMENT; RHAMNOGALACTURONAN-I"
