"433" "INCORPORATION OF MXN+ GROUPS INTO POLYOXOMETALATES (POMS) PROVIDES THE MEANS NOT ONLY TO INTRODUCE REACTIVITY AND FUNCTIONALITY BUT ALSO TO TUNE THE ELECTRONIC PROPERTIES OF THE OXIDE FRAMEWORK BY VARYING M, X AND N. IN ORDER TO ELUCIDATE THE FACTORS RESPONSIBLE FOR DIFFERENCES IN REACTIVITY BETWEEN TIW5 AND SNW5 LINDQVIST-TYPE HEXAMETALATES, A SERIES OF ALKOXIDO- AND ARYLOXIDO-TIN SUBSTITUTED POMS (NBU4N)3[(RO)SNW5O18] (R=ME, ET, IPR AND TBU) AND (NBU4N)3[(ARO)SNW5O18] (AR=C6H5, 4-MEC6H5, 4-TBUC6H5, 4-HOC6H4, 3-HOC6H4 AND 2-CHOC6H4) HAS BEEN STRUCTURALLY CHARACTERISED AND STUDIED BY MULTINUCLEAR NMR (1H, 13C, 17O, 119SN AND 183W) AND FTIR SPECTROSCOPY. SPECTROSCOPIC AND STRUCTURAL PARAMETERS WERE COMPARED WITH THOSE OF TITANIUM-SUBSTITUTED HOMOLOGUES AND, WHEN COUPLED WITH THEORETICAL STUDIES, INDICATED THAT SNOR AND SNOAR BONDS ARE IONIC WITH LITTLE -CONTRIBUTION, WHEREAS TIOR AND TIOAR BONDS ARE MORE COVALENT WITH -BONDING THAT IS MORE PREVALENT FOR TIOR THAN TIOAR. THIS EXPERIMENTAL AND THEORETICAL ANALYSIS OF BONDING IN A HOMOLOGOUS SERIES OF REACTIVE POMS IS THE MOST EXTENSIVE AND DETAILED TO DATE, AND REVEALS FACTORS WHICH ACCOUNT FOR SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES IN REACTIVITY BETWEEN TIN AND TITANIUM CONGENERS. 2018 WILEY-VCH VERLAG GMBH & CO.
