"644" "A POLYPHASIC STUDY WAS UNDERTAKEN TO ESTABLISH THE TAXONOMIC STATUS OF STREPTOMYCES STRAINS ISOLATED FROM HYPER-ARID ATACAMA DESERT SOILS. ANALYSIS OF THE 16S RRNA GENE SEQUENCES OF THE ISOLATES SHOWED THAT THEY FORMED A WELL-DEFINED LINEAGE THAT WAS LOOSELY ASSOCIATED WITH THE TYPE STRAINS OF SEVERAL STREPTOMYCES SPECIES. MULTI-LOCUS SEQUENCE ANALYSIS BASED ON FIVE HOUSEKEEPING GENE ALLELES SHOWED THAT THE STRAINS FORM A HOMOGENEOUS TAXON THAT IS CLOSELY RELATED TO THE TYPE STRAINS OF STREPTOMYCES GHANAENSIS AND STREPTOMYCES VIRIDOSPORUS. REPRESENTATIVE ISOLATES WERE SHOWN TO HAVE CHEMOTAXONOMIC AND MORPHOLOGICAL PROPERTIES CONSISTENT WITH THEIR CLASSIFICATION IN THE GENUS STREPTOMYCES. THE ISOLATES HAVE MANY PHENOTYPIC FEATURES IN COMMON, SOME OF WHICH DISTINGUISH THEM FROM S. GHANAENSIS NRRL B-12104T, THEIR NEAR PHYLOGENETIC NEIGHBOUR. ON THE BASIS OF THESE GENOTYPIC AND PHENOTYPIC DATA IT IS PROPOSED THAT THE ISOLATES BE RECOGNISED AS A NEW SPECIES WITHIN THE GENUS STREPTOMYCES, NAMED STREPTOMYCES ASENJONII SP. NOV. THE TYPE STRAIN OF THE SPECIES IS KNN35.1BT (NCIMB 15082T=NRRL B-65050T). SOME OF THE ISOLATES, INCLUDING THE TYPE STRAIN, SHOWED ANTIBACTERIAL ACTIVITY IN STANDARD PLUG ASSAYS. IN ADDITION, MLSA, AVERAGE NUCLEOTIDE IDENTITY AND PHENOTYPIC DATA SHOW THAT THE TYPE STRAINS OF S. GHANAENSIS AND S. VIRIDOSPORUS BELONG TO THE SAME SPECIES. CONSEQUENTLY, IT IS PROPOSED THAT THE FORMER BE RECOGNISED AS A HETEROTYPIC SYNONYM OF THE LATTER AND AN EMENDED DESCRIPTION IS GIVEN FOR S. VIRIDOSPORUS. 2017, THE AUTHOR(S)."
