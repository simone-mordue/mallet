SCOPE AND APPROACH THE FOOD COGNITION DISSONANCE (FCD) CONCEPTUAL FRAMEWORK INTEGRATES RELEVANT PRINCIPLES OF COGNITIVE DISSONANCE AND ATTITUDE, IN THE CONTEXT OF FOOD AND NUTRITION, TO PROVIDE A NOVEL PERSPECTIVE OF STRUCTURAL FOOD-RELATED COGNITIVE DISSONANCE IN RELATION TO THE EXAMINATION OF FOOD-RELATED ATTITUDES. THE ELEMENTS AND MECHANISMS WITHIN THE FCD FRAMEWORK ARE ELABORATED, AND CONSIDERATIONS IN THE USE OF THE FRAMEWORK ARE DISCUSSED. KEY FINDINGS AND CONCLUSION THE FCD FRAMEWORK CAN BE APPLIED TO PREDICTING HOW DISSONANCE-BASED, FOOD-RELATED ATTITUDE CHANGE OCCURS. THE APPROACH MAY STIMULATE RESEARCH THAT WILL ULTIMATELY LEAD TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF EFFECTIVE NUTRITION PROGRAMMES AND/OR COMMUNICATIONS TO PROMOTE HEALTHY EATING. 2016 ELSEVIER LTD" "COGNITIVE DISSONANCE IN FOOD AND NUTRITION A CONCEPTUAL FRAMEWORK" "ATTITUDE CHANGE; COGNITIVE CONSISTENCY; COGNITIVE DISSONANCE; DIETARY BEHAVIOUR"
