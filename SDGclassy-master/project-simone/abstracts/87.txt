"643" "A POLYPHASIC STUDY WAS UNDERTAKEN TO ESTABLISH THE TAXONOMIC POSITION OF A NON-CHROMOGENIC, RAPIDLY GROWING MYCOBACTERIUM STRAIN THAT HAD BEEN ISOLATED FROM SPUTUM. THE STRAIN, CECT 8775T, HAS CHEMOTAXONOMIC AND CULTURAL PROPERTIES CONSISTENT WITH ITS CLASSIFICATION IN THE GENUS MYCOBACTERIUM AND WAS DISTINGUISHED FROM THE TYPE STRAINS OF CLOSELY RELATED MYCOBACTERIAL SPECIES, NOTABLY FROM MYCOBACTERIUM PARAENSE DSM 46749T, ITS NEAREST PHYLOGENETIC NEIGHBOUR, BASED ON 16S RRNA, HSP65 AND RPOB GENE SEQUENCE DATA. THESE ORGANISMS WERE ALSO DISTINGUISHED BY A BROAD RANGE OF CHEMOTAXONOMIC AND PHENOTYPIC FEATURES AND BY A DIGITAL DNADNA RELATEDNESS VALUE OF 22.8 %. CONSEQUENTLY, THE STRAIN IS CONSIDERED TO REPRESENT A NOVEL SPECIES OF MYCOBACTERIUM FOR WHICH THE NAME MYCOBACTERIUM EBURNEUM SP. NOV IS PROPOSED, THE TYPE STRAIN IS X82T (CECT 8775T=DSM 44358T). 2017 IUMS." "MYCOBACTERIUM EBURNEUM SP.
