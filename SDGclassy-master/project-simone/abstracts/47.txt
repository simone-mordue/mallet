"1048" "A MICROMONOSPORA STRAIN, DESIGNATED DS3186T, ISOLATED FROM SEDIMENT COLLECTED FROM THE BLACK SEA OFF THE YASON PENINSULA, ORDU, TURKEY, WAS EXAMINATED USING A POLYPHASIC APPROACH. THE STRAIN WAS FOUND TO HAVE CHEMOTAXONOMIC, MORPHOLOGICAL AND PHYLOGENETIC PROPERTIES CONSISTENT WITH ITS CLASIFICATION IN THE GENUS MICROMONOSPORA. A COMPARATIVE 16S RRNA GENE SEQUENCE ANALYSIS SHOWED THAT THE STRAIN WAS CLOSELY RELATED TO THE TYPE STRAINS OF MICROMONOSPORA OLIVASTEROSPORA (99.0%), MICROMONOSPORA EQUINA (98.8%), MICROMONOSPORA RHIZOSPHAERAE (98.8%) AND MICROMONOSPORA VIRIDIFACIENS (98.8%), LOW LEVELS OF DNADNA RELATEDNES WERE FOUND BETWEEN THE ISOLATE AND THE M. OLIVASTEROSPORA AND M. RHIZOSPHAERAE STRAINS. CORRESPONDING PHYLOGENETIC ANALYSIS BASED ON PARTIAL GYRB GENE SEQUENCES SHOWED THAT STRAIN DS3186T FORMED A SUBCLADE WITH THE TYPE STRAINS OF MICROMONOSPORA EBURNEA, M. EQUINA, MICROMONOSPORA NARATHIWATENSIS AND M. VIRIDIFACIENS. STRAIN DS3186T WAS DISTINGUISHED FROM ITS CLOSE PHYLOGENETIC NEIGHBOURS USING A COMBINATION OF CHEMOTAXONOMIC, MORPHOLOGICAL AND PHYSIOLOGICAL PROPERTIES. CONSEQUENTLY, IT IS PROPOSED THAT STRAIN DS3186T REPRESENTS A NOVEL MICROMONOSPORA SPECIES FOR WHICH THE NAME MICROMONOSPORAYASONENSIS SP. NOV. IS PROPOSED. THE TYPE STRAIN IS DS3186T (=DSM 45980T=KCTC 29433T). 2016, SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING SWITZERLAND." "MICROMONOSPORA YASONENSIS SP.
