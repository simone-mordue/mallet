FIVE YEARS BEFORE REPORTING ON AICHI TARGETS IS DUE, WE ASSESSED THE PHILIPPINES CURRENT PROTECTED AREA SYSTEM FOR BIODIVERSITY COVERAGE, APPROPRIATENESS OF MANAGEMENT REGIMES AND CAPACITY TO DELIVER PROTECTION. ALTHOUGH PROTECTED ESTATE ALREADY COVERS 11% OF THE PHILIPPINES LAND AREA, 64% OF ITS KEY BIODIVERSITY AREAS (KBAS) REMAIN UNPROTECTED. FEW PROTECTED AREAS HAVE APPROPRIATE MANAGEMENT AND GOVERNANCE INFRASTRUCTURES, FUNDING STREAMS, MANAGEMENT PLANS AND CAPACITY, AND A SERIOUS MISMATCH EXISTS BETWEEN PROTECTED AREA LAND ZONATION REGIMES AND CONSERVATION NEEDS OF KEY SPECIES. FOR THE PHILIPPINES TO MEET THE BIODIVERSITY COVERAGE AND MANAGEMENT EFFECTIVENESS ELEMENTS OF AICHI TARGET 11, PROTECTED AREA AND KBA BOUNDARIES SHOULD BE ALIGNED, MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS REFORMED TO PURSUE BIODIVERSITY-LED TARGETS AND EFFECTIVE MANAGEMENT CAPACITY CREATED. 2015, ROYAL SWEDISH ACADEMY OF SCIENCES."
