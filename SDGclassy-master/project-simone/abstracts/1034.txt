"281" "PORE WALL THINNING OF MESOPOROUS 4H-SIC BY SACRIFICIAL OXIDATION IS PERFORMED. THE DIMENSIONS WITHIN THE AS-ETCHED POROUS SIC ARE REDUCED DURING DRY OXIDATION AT 1100C BY CONSUMING SIC AND REMOVING THE GROWN SIO2 IN THE SUBSEQUENT HYDROFLUORIC ACID (HF) DIP STEP. THE PROCESS REDUCES THE AVERAGE PORE WALL THICKNESS FROM 27NM TO APPROXIMATELY 16NM AND REDUCES THE THICKNESS STANDARD DEVIATION FROM 5 TO 1.4NM FOR THE INVESTIGATED 9 H OXIDATION INTERVAL. THE NEW PORE WALL THINNING METHOD WILL ENABLE CONTROLLED NANOSCALE SIZE REDUCTION CAPABILITY FOR MESOPOROUS 4H-SIC DERIVED NANOSTRUCTURES. 2018 WILEY-VCH VERLAG GMBH & CO.
