SIX [AU(LP)CL] COMPLEXES HAVE BEEN PREPARED AND FIVE WERE CHARACTERISED BY X-RAY CRYSTALLOGRAPHY, AS WELL AS COMPLEX [AU(S)-3A2]SBF6. SIX [AG(LP)OTF] COMPLEXES WERE SYNTHESISED, STUDIED BY VT NMR SPECTROSCOPY AND, IN THE CASE OF [AG(R)-2BOTF], BY X-RAY CRYSTALLOGRAPHY. SIX [CU(LP)(MECN)2]PF6 COMPLEXES WERE PREPARED, AND [CU(R)-3B(MECN)2]PF6 WAS CHARACTERISED CRYSTALLOGRAPHICALLY, AS WAS THE DECOMPOSITION PRODUCT [CU(S)-1A(O2PF2)]2. 2017 WILEY-VCH VERLAG GMBH & CO.
