"610" "DRAWING ON THE MOBILITY TURN, RESEARCH IN RURAL STUDIES HAS ENGAGED WITH NEW EXPLORATIONS OF MOBILITIES, BEYOND THE NOW WELL-EXPLORED COUNTERURBANISATION AND RURAL GENTRIFICATION PROCESSES, INCLUDING LOCAL AND TEMPORARY MOBILITY IN DIVERSE SOCIO-ECONOMIC AND CULTURAL CONTEXTS. THIS PAPER EXPLORES PAST AND POTENTIAL FUTURE MOBILITY PATTERNS IN TWO REGIONAL TOWNS IN NON-METROPOLITAN GREECE IN THE CONTEXT OF THE ONGOING FINANCIAL CRISIS. USING A CHOICE EXPERIMENT, WE ASSESS THE IMPORTANCE OF SETTLEMENT TYPES, FAMILY NETWORKS, PREVIOUS RESIDENCY IN THE AREA, CULTURAL OPPORTUNITIES AND CHANGE IN EMPLOYMENT TYPE IN INFORMING FUTURE MOBILITY DECISIONS. THE ANALYSIS FINDS EVIDENCE OF DIVERSE MOBILITIES, AND DISTINGUISHES BETWEEN TWO PREDOMINANT MOBILITY GROUPS, I.E. COUNTERURBANISERS AND LOCAL MOVERS. WE FURTHER LOOK AT RELOCATION PREFERENCES FOR THE TWO GROUPS AND FIND SIMILAR PREFERENCES FOR REGIONAL TOWNS. IN THIS CONTEXT, WE PROVIDE EVIDENCE FOR THE POTENTIAL EMERGENCE OF AN ALTERNATIVE, I.E. NOT ROOTED IN PASTORALISM, VERSION OF THE ANGLO-AMERICAN RURAL IDYLL. 2017 ELSEVIER LTD" "EMERGING GEOGRAPHIES OF MOBILITY: THE ROLE OF REGIONAL TOWNS IN GREECE'S COUNTERURBANISATION STORY" "CHOICE EXPERIMENT; COUNTERURBANISATION; GREECE; MOBILITIES"
