"638" "HABITAT AND FISHERIES USAGE DATA ARE KEY COMPONENTS FOR ECOSYSTEM-BASED APPROACH TO FISHERIES MANAGEMENT (EBFM). SIGNIFICANT GAPS IN KNOWLEDGE REMAIN FOR FISHERIES-HABITAT INTERACTIONS, PARTICULARLY IN INSHORE FISHERIES WHERE VESSELS ARE &LT,12 M IN LENGTH. HERE, WE SHOW CHANGES IN INSHORE FISHING EFFORT DISTRIBUTION (&LT,12 M) AND HABITAT USE OVER THE DECADE 2004-2013. SIGHTINGS DATA OF FISHING VESSEL ACTIVITY RECORDED BY THE NORTHUMBERLAND INSHORE FISHERY AND CONSERVATION AUTHORITY (NIFCA) WERE COMBINED WITH LANDINGS DATA TO ESTIMATE AND MAP POTFISHING ACTIVITY BETWEEN 2004 AND 2013. SPATIAL TEMPORAL CHANGES WERE INVESTIGATED USING MONTE CARLO SIMULATION OF RANDOMLY SAMPLED FISHING EFFORT MAPS. HIGH RESOLUTION (1 M) BROADSCALE (EUNIS LEVEL 3) PREDICTIVE HABITAT MAPS OF THE COQUET TO ST MARYS' MARINE CONSERVATION ZONE (CQSM MCZ) WERE USED TO INVESTIGATE SPATIAL TEMPORAL CHANGES IN FISHERS' HABITAT SELECTION USING COMPOSITIONAL ANALYSIS. FISHING EFFORT IN NORTHUMBERLAND INCREASED BETWEEN 2004 AND 2013 (233 642-354 193 POTS YEAR-1). FISHING EFFORT DISTRIBUTION DIFFERED BETWEEN INDIVIDUAL YEARS, DECREASING OVER LARGE AREAS BETWEEN 2004 AND 2007, FOLLOWED BY INCREASES, ESPECIALLY INSHORE, BETWEEN 2008 AND 2013. FISHERS IN THE CQSM MCZ SHOWED A PREFERENCE FOR ROCKY HABITATS OVER SEDIMENT HABITATS. HABITAT PREFERENCE DID NOT VARY BETWEEN YEARS ALTHOUGH ALL HABITATS EXPERIENCED INCREASING FISHING PRESSURE. SPATIAL TEMPORAL CHANGES IN FISHING EFFORT AND HABITAT USE WERE DISCUSSED IN RELATION TO EBFM. 2017 INTERNATIONAL COUNCIL FOR THE EXPLORATION OF THE SEA. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED."
