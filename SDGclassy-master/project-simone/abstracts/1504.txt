"1097" "THE OBJECTIVE OF THIS WORK WAS TO INVESTIGATE THE EVALUATION OF SWINE COLOSTRUM IMMUNOGLOBULIN G (IGG) CONCENTRATION USING THE BRIX REFRACTOMETER. COLOSTRUM SAMPLES WERE COLLECTED ACROSS ALL TEATS, FROM 124 SOWS OF MIXED PARITIES. ACCORDING TO SAMPLING TIME, THREE CATEGORIES WERE CREATED: SAMPLES AVAILABLE FROM 9 H BEFORE THE ONSET OF PARTURITION UNTIL THE FIRST PIGLET WAS BORN WERE CLASSIFIED AS BEFORE FARROWING, SAMPLES COLLECTED AFTER THE FIRST BIRTH UNTIL 4 H LATER WERE CLASSIFIED AS DURING FARROWING, AND FINALLY SAMPLES COLLECTED FROM THIS POINT UNTIL 14 H AFTER PARTURITION, WERE CLASSIFIED AS AFTER FARROWING. SAMPLES WERE DRAWN AND DIVIDED INTO THREE PORTIONS, ONE WAS IMMEDIATELY ANALYZED, A SECOND WAS REFRIGERATED AND THE THIRD WAS FROZEN AT -20C. FRESH AND REFRIGERATED COLOSTRUM SAMPLES WERE ANALYZED AT THE FARM WITH A BRIX REFRACTOMETER. IGG CONTENT OF FROZEN SAMPLES WAS ANALYZED USING A BRIX REFRACTOMETER, WITH A SUBSET OF 42 SAMPLES ALSO TESTED WITH A COMMERCIALLY AVAILABLE RADIAL IMMUNE DIFFUSION (RID) KIT. THE BRIX PERCENTAGE RANGED FROM 18.3% TO 33.2%. BRIX PERCENTAGE REPEATABILITY, ASSESSED BY THE INTRACLASS CORRELATION COEFFICIENT (ICC), WAS VERY STRONG (FRESH ICC=0.98, REFRIGERATED ICC=0.88 AND FROZEN ICC=0.99). ONE-WAY REPEATED-MEASURES ANOVA SHOWED THAT STORAGE TEMPERATURE DID NOT AFFECT BRIX PERCENTAGE OF COLOSTRUM IGG (P&GT,0.05). ANOVA RESULTS SHOW A SIGNIFICANT EFFECT OF SAMPLING TIME ON COLOSTRUM IMMUNOGLOBULIN CONCENTRATION, MEASURED WITH BOTH BRIX AND RID (BRIX: P&LT,0.003, RID: P&LT,0.05). IMMUNOGLOBULIN G CONCENTRATION MEASURED BY RID RANGED FROM 13.27 TO 35.08 MG/ML. PEARSON CORRELATION COEFFICIENT REVEALED THAT BRIX PERCENTAGE WAS POSITIVELY CORRELATED (R=0.56, P&LT,0.001) WITH RID RESULTS (REGRESSION EQUATION: RID=1.01 (0.2) BRIX -1.94 (5.66), R 2=0.31). THE RESULTS OF THIS STUDY INDICATE THAT THE BRIX REFRACTOMETER PROVIDES A SIMPLE, FAST AND INEXPENSIVE ESTIMATION OF COLOSTRUM IGG IN SOWS. THE ANIMAL CONSORTIUM 2015."
