"1568" "THE EXPRESSION OF CLAUDIN-4, A PROTEIN INVOLVED IN TIGHT JUNCTION COMPLEXES, IS WIDELY DYSREGULATED IN EPITHELIAL MALIGNANCIES. CLAUDIN-4 IS OVEREXPRESSED IN SEVERAL PREMALIGNANT PRECURSOR LESIONS, INCLUDING THOSE OF CANCERS OF THE BREAST, PANCREAS, AND PROSTATE, AND IS ASSOCIATED WITH POOR SURVIVAL. A NONCYTOTOXIC C-TERMINAL FRAGMENT OF CLOSTRIDIUM PERFRINGENS ENTEROTOXIN (CCPE) IS A NATURAL LIGAND FOR CLAUDIN-4. HERE, WE DEMONSTRATE WHOLE-BODY QUANTITATIVE SPECT IMAGING OF PRENEOPLASTIC BREAST CANCER TISSUE USING 111IN-LABELED CCPE. METHODS: CCPE.GST OR GST (GST IS GLUTATHIONE S-TRANSFERASE) WAS CONJUGATED TO THE METAL ION CHELATOR BENZYL-DIETHYLENETRIAMINEPENTAACETIC ACID TO ALLOW 111IN RADIOLABELING. THE AFFINITY OF RADIOLABELED CCPE.GST FOR CLAUDIN-4 WAS CONFIRMED USING CLAUDIN-4-EXPRESSING MDA-MB-468 AND SQ20B CELLS, COMPARED WITH CLAUDIN-4-NEGATIVE HT1080 CELLS. IN VIVO SPECT IMAGING WAS PERFORMED USING ATHYMIC MICE BEARING MDA-MB-468 OR HT1080 XENOGRAFTS AND USING GENETICALLY MODIFIED BALB/NEUT MICE, WHICH SPONTANEOUSLY DEVELOP CLAUDIN-4-EXPRESSING BREAST CANCER LESIONS. RESULTS: THE UPTAKE OF 111IN-CCPE.GST IN CLAUDIN-4-POSITIVE MDA-MB-468 XENOGRAFT TUMORS IN ATHYMIC MICE WAS SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER THAN IN 111IN-GST OR CLAUDIN-4-NEGATIVE HT1080 TUMORS (6.72 0.18 VS. 3.88 1.00 VS. 2.36 1.25 PERCENTAGE INJECTED DOSE PER GRAM [%ID/G], P < 0.0001). NO OTHER SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES WERE OBSERVED IN ANY OF THE EXAMINED ORGANS. BALB/NEUT MICE, EXPRESSING RAT NEUT UNDER MMTV PROMOTOR CONTROL, SPONTANEOUSLY DEVELOPED TUMOROUS LESIONS WITHIN THEIR MAMMARY FAT PADS OVER THE COURSE OF 130 D. OVERT MAMMARY TUMORS WERE CLAUDIN-4-POSITIVE, AND 111IN-CCPE.GST UPTAKE WAS 3.2 0.70%ID/G, SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER THAN 111IN-GST (1.00 0.60%ID/G, P < 0.05). MAMMARY FAT PADS IN MICE AGED 80 D BORE CLAUDIN-4-POSITIVE APLASTIC LESIONS AND ACCUMULATED 111IN-CCPE.GST (3.17 0.51%ID/G) BUT NOT 111IN-GST (0.99 0.39%ID/G, P < 0.001). CONCLUSION: TAKEN TOGETHER, 111IN-CCPE.GST TARGETS CLAUDIN-4 EXPRESSION IN FRANK TUMORS AND PRENEOPLASTIC TISSUE, AND CCPE IMAGING MAY BE USED AS AN EARLY DETECTION TOOL FOR BREAST, PROSTATE, AND PANCREATIC CANCER.
