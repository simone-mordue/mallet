"923" "BACKGROUND: EXAMINING ESSENTIAL BIOCHEMICAL PATHWAYS IN PLASMODIUM FALCIPARUM PRESENTS SERIOUS CHALLENGES, AS STANDARD MOLECULAR TECHNIQUES SUCH AS SIRNA CANNOT BE EMPLOYED IN THIS ORGANISM, AND GENERATING GENE KNOCK-OUTS OF ESSENTIAL PROTEINS REQUIRES SPECIALIZED CONDITIONAL APPROACHES. IN THE STUDY OF PROTEIN KINASES, PHARMACOLOGICAL INHIBITION PRESENTS A FEASIBLE ALTERNATIVE OPTION. HOWEVER, AS IN MAMMALIAN SYSTEMS, INHIBITORS OFTEN LACK THE DESIRED SELECTIVITY. DESCRIBED HERE IS A CHEMICAL GENETIC APPROACH TO SELECTIVELY INHIBIT PFNEK-2 IN P. FALCIPARUM, A MEMBER OF THE NIMA-RELATED KINASE FAMILY THAT IS ESSENTIAL FOR COMPLETION OF THE SEXUAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE PARASITE. RESULTS: INTRODUCTION OF A VALINE TO CYSTEINE MUTATION AT POSITION 24 IN THE GLYCINE RICH LOOP OF PFNEK-2 DOES NOT AFFECT KINASE ACTIVITY BUT CONFERS SENSITIVITY TO THE PROTEIN KINASE INHIBITOR 4-(6-ETHYNYL-9H-PURIN-2-YLAMINO) BENZENE SULFONAMIDE (NCL-00016066). USING A COMBINATION OF IN VITRO KINASE ASSAYS AND MASS SPECTROMETRY, (INCLUDING PHOSPHOPROTEOMICS) THE STUDY SHOWS THAT THIS COMPOUND ACTS AS AN IRREVERSIBLE INHIBITOR TO THE MUTANT PFNEK2 LIKELY THROUGH A COVALENT LINK WITH THE INTRODUCED CYSTEINE RESIDUE. IN PARTICULAR, THIS WAS SHOWN BY ANALYSIS OF TOTAL PROTEIN MASS USING MASS SPECTROMETRY WHICH SHOWED A SHIFT IN MOLECULAR WEIGHT OF THE MUTANT KINASE IN THE PRESENCE OF THE INHIBITOR TO BE PRECISELY EQUIVALENT TO THE MOLECULAR WEIGHT OF NCL-00016066. A SIMILAR MOLECULAR WEIGHT SHIFT WAS NOT OBSERVED IN THE WILD TYPE KINASE. IMPORTANTLY, THIS INHIBITOR HAS LITTLE ACTIVITY TOWARDS THE WILD TYPE PFNEK-2 AND, THEREFORE, HAS ALL THE PROPERTIES OF AN EFFECTIVE CHEMICAL GENETIC TOOL THAT COULD BE EMPLOYED TO DETERMINE THE CELLULAR TARGETS FOR PFNEK-2. CONCLUSIONS: ALLELIC REPLACEMENT OF WILD-TYPE PFNEK-2 WITH THE MUTATED KINASE WILL ALLOW FOR TARGETED INHIBITION OF PFNEK-2 WITH NCL-00016066 AND HENCE PAVE THE WAY FOR COMPARATIVE STUDIES AIMED AT UNDERSTANDING THE BIOLOGICAL ROLE AND TRANSMISSION-BLOCKING POTENTIAL OF PFNEK-2. 2016 THE AUTHOR(S)."
