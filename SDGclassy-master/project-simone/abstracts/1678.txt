"1540" "THIS 3 3 FACTORIAL STUDY ASSESSED PYRETHROIDS, CARBAMATES AND NEONICOTENOIDS GROUPS OF PESTICIDES IN REPLICATED SAMPLES OF THREE FISH SPECIES FROM LOW (S1, REFERENCE), MEDIUM (S2) AND HEAVY (S3) POLLUTED SITES RECEIVING AGRICULTURAL RUN-OFFS AROUND THE INDUS RIVER. WATER AND SEDIMENT SAMPLES FROM THE SAME SITES WERE ALSO ANALYSED FOR THESE PESTICIDES BY USING HIGH-PERFORMANCE LIQUID CHROMATOGRAPHY. OUT OF NINE INVESTIGATED PESTICIDES, ONLY THREE PESTICIDES (DELTAMETHRIN, CARBOFURAN AND CYPERMETHRIN) WERE DETECTED IN FISH AND SEDIMENT SAMPLES. DELTAMETHRIN IN CYPRINUS CARPIO RANGED FROM 0.490 TO 0.839G/G, MOSTLY EXCEEDING 0.5G/G AS THE MAXIMUM RESIDUAL LIMIT SUGGESTED BY FAO-WHO, WHEREAS IT RANGED FROM 0.214 TO 0.318G/G IN THE SAMPLED SEDIMENTS. THE CARBOFURAN CONCENTRATIONS WERE 0.04250.066 AND 0.6130.946G/G IN LABEO ROHITA AND CHANNA MARULIUS MUSCLES RESPECTIVELY AND 0.0690.081G/G IN THE CORRESPONDING SEDIMENT SAMPLES. THESE VALUES WERE EITHER HIGHER OR LOWER THAN THE MAXIMUM LIMIT (0.1G/G) AS SUGGESTED BY FAO-WHO. CONVERSELY, THE CYPERMETHRIN CONCENTRATION RANGED FROM 0.141 TO 0.174 IN CH. MARULIUS AND 0.1830.197G/G IN SEDIMENTS WHICH WERE BOTH BELOW THE FAO-WHO MAXIMUM LIMIT OF 2G/G. NO PESTICIDE RESIDUES WERE DETECTED IN WATER FROM THESE SAMPLING SITES. MOST SELECTED PHYSICOCHEMICAL VARIABLES WERE WITHIN THE ACCEPTABLE RANGE OF WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION FOR THE WATER QUALITY FOR AQUATIC LIFE. THE DETECTED PESTICIDE CONTENTS WERE MOSTLY HIGHER IN FISH MUSCLES FROM HEAVILY POLLUTED SITES. THIS IS WORRYING BECAUSE THESE PESTICIDES MAY POSE HEALTH RISKS FOR THE FISH AND PEOPLE OF THE STUDY AREA. HOWEVER, A PRELIMINARY RISK ASSESSMENT INDICATED THAT THE CALCULATED DAILY INTAKE OF DETECTED PESTICIDES BY PEOPLE CONSUMING FISH FROM THE INDUS RIVER WAS LOW AND DID NOT PRESENT AN IMMEDIATE RISK TO THE FISH-CONSUMING PEOPLE. THIS STUDY MAY BE USED AS A BENCHMARK TO DETERMINE THE SAFETY OF FISH MEAT IN ORDER TO DEVELOP INTERVENTION STRATEGIES TO MAINTAIN THE WATER QUALITY AND TO PROTECT THE HEALTH OF FISH AND FISH-CONSUMING PEOPLE. 2015, SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING SWITZERLAND."
