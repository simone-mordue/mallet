"1195" "A COMPACT DONORACCEPTOR MOLECULAR DYAD HAS BEEN SYNTHESIZED BY ATTACHING AN N,N-DIMETHYLAMINO FRAGMENT TO A NAPHTHALIC ANHYDRIDE RESIDUE. THE DYAD SHOWS FLUORESCENCE FROM AN INTRAMOLECULAR CHARGE-TRANSFER STATE (I.E., CHARGE-RECOMBINATION FLUORESCENCE) IN SOLUTION, WITH THE PHOTO-PHYSICAL PROPERTIES BEING STRONGLY DEPENDENT ON THE SOLVENT POLARITY. SIMILAR EMISSION IS SEEN FOR SINGLE CRYSTALS OF THE TARGET COMPOUND, THE MOLECULES BEING ALIGNED HEAD-TO-HEAD, ALTHOUGH TIME-RESOLVED EMISSION PROFILES DISPLAY DUAL-EXPONENTIAL KINETICS. A SECOND POLYMORPH WITH THE HEAD-TO-TAIL ALIGNMENT ALSO GIVES RISE TO TWO LIFETIMES THAT DIFFER SOMEWHAT FROM THOSE OF THE FIRST STRUCTURE, WHICH ARE ASSIGNED TO BULK AND SURFACE-BOUND MOLECULES. GROWING THE CRYSTAL IN THE PRESENCE OF RHODAMINE B LOCALIZES THE DYE AROUND THE SURFACE. EXCITATION OF THE CRYSTAL IS FOLLOWED BY SUB-PS EXCITON MIGRATION ALONG THE ALIGNED STACKS, WITH OCCASIONAL CROSSING TO ADJACENT STACKS AND TRAPPING AT THE SURFACE. RHODAMINE B PRESENT AT VERY LOW LEVELS ACTS AS THE ACCEPTOR FOR EXCITONS ENTERING THE SURFACE LAYER. CRYSTALS EMBEDDED IN A POLYESTER RESIN FORM AN ARTIFICIAL LIGHT-HARVESTING ANTENNA ABLE TO SENSITIZE AN AMORPHOUS SILICON SOLAR CELL. 2016 WILEY-VCH VERLAG GMBH & CO.
