"985" "BACKGROUND: THE PHOSPHATIDYLINOSITOL-3-KINASE/MAMMALIAN TARGET OF RAPAMYCIN (PI3K/MTOR) PATHWAY IS COMMONLY DEREGULATED IN HUMAN CANCER, HENCE MANY PI3K AND MTOR INHIBITORS HAVE BEEN DEVELOPED AND HAVE NOW REACHED CLINICAL TRIALS. SIMILARLY, CDKS HAVE BEEN INVESTIGATED AS CANCER DRUG TARGETS. METHODS: WE HAVE SYNTHESISED AND CHARACTERISED A SERIES OF 6-AMINOPYRIMIDINES IDENTIFIED FROM A KINASE SCREEN THAT INHIBIT PI3K AND/OR MTOR AND/OR CDK2. KINASE INHIBITION, TUMOUR CELL GROWTH, CELL CYCLE DISTRIBUTION, CYTOTOXICITY AND SIGNALLING EXPERIMENTS WERE UNDERTAKEN IN HCT116 AND HT29 COLORECTAL CANCER CELL LINES, AND IN VIVO HT29 EFFICACY STUDIES. RESULTS: 2,6-DIAMINOPYRIMIDINES WITH AN O4-CYCLOHEXYLMETHYL SUBSTITUENT AND A C-5-NITROSO OR CYANO GROUP (1,2,5) INDUCED CELL CYCLE PHASE ALTERATIONS AND WERE GROWTH INHIBITORY (GI50 &LT,20 M). COMPOUND 1, BUT NOT 2 OR 5, POTENTLY INHIBITS CDK2 (IC50 =0.1 NM) AS WELL AS PI3K, AND WAS CYTOTOXIC AT GROWTH INHIBITORY CONCENTRATIONS. CONSISTENT WITH KINASE INHIBITION DATA, COMPOUND 1 REDUCED PHOSPHO-RB AND PHOSPHO-RS6 AT GI50 CONCENTRATIONS. COMBINATION OF NU6102 (CDK2 INHIBITOR) AND PICTILISIB (GDC-0941, PAN-PI3K INHIBITOR) RESULTED IN SYNERGISTIC GROWTH INHIBITION, AND ENHANCED CYTOTOXICITY IN HT29 CELLS IN VITRO AND HT29 TUMOUR GROWTH INHIBITION IN VIVO. CONCLUSIONS: THESE STUDIES IDENTIFIED A NOVEL SERIES OF MIXED CDK2/PI3K INHIBITORS AND DEMONSTRATE THAT DUAL TARGETING OF CDK2 AND PI3K CAN RESULT IN ENHANCED ANTITUMOUR ACTIVITY. 2016 CANCER RESEARCH UK."
