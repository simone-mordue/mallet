"1298" "ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITIONS CAN MODULATE THE DEVELOPMENTAL PROGRAM AND HAVE ENDURING CONSEQUENCES ON THE LIFE CYCLE, AFFECTING LONG-TERM HEALTH AND DISEASE RISK THROUGH TO ADULTHOOD. THESE EFFECTS CAN OCCUR THROUGH DIFFERENT MECHANISMS AND AT DIFFERENT STAGES OF DEVELOPMENT. THIS CHAPTER CONSIDERS ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS THAT MAY OCCUR DURING THE PERICONCEPTIONAL PERIOD, AROUND THE TIME OF CONCEPTION AND DURING EARLY EMBRYO DEVELOPMENT, AND HAVE LASTING EFFECTS ON PHENOTYPE AND LIFETIME HEALTH. WE REVIEW IN PARTICULAR INVIVO CONDITIONS OF MATERNAL DIETARY NUTRITION DURING PERICONCEPTIONAL DEVELOPMENT, BOTH POOR AND OVER-RICH NUTRITION, AND HOW SUCH CONDITIONS MAY AFFECT THE EARLY EMBRYO, ALTERING SUBSEQUENT DEVELOPMENT AND POSTNATAL HEALTH. IN ADDITION, INVITRO CONDITIONS THAT EMBRYOS MAY EXPERIENCE, IN PARTICULAR ASSOCIATED WITH ASSISTED CONCEPTION TECHNOLOGIES, ARE REVIEWED. WE ALSO EVALUATE THE IMPORTANCE OF PATERNAL AS WELL AS MATERNAL ENVIRONMENT DURING PERICONCEPTIONAL INDUCTION OF DEVELOPMENTAL PROGRAMMING. WE CONCLUDE THAT THE PERICONCEPTIONAL ENVIRONMENT IS ONE OF CRITICAL SENSITIVITY FOR LIFETIME HEALTH AND THERE IS A NEED FOR CONTINUED RESEARCH WITHIN THIS FIELD TO IDENTIFY MECHANISMS AND DEVISE PROTECTIVE STRATEGIES. 2016 ELSEVIER INC.
