"349" "THE VO2 +/VO2 + REDOX REACTION TAKES PLACE IN THE CATHOLYTE SOLUTION OF THE ALL-VANADIUM REDOX FLOW BATTERY (VRFB), ONE OF THE FEW OPTIONS TO ELECTROCHEMICALLY STORE ENERGY FROM INTERMITTENT RENEWABLE SOURCES ON A LARGE SCALE. HOWEVER, THE SLUGGISH REDOX KINETICS OF THE VO2 +/VO2 + COUPLE LIMIT THE POWER DENSITY OF THE VRFB, WHICH INCREASES THE FOOTPRINT OF THE POWER CONVERTERS AND INCREASES CAPITAL COSTS. THEREFORE, CATALYSIS OF THE REDOX REACTION AND A DEEPER UNDERSTANDING OF ITS INTRICATE REACTION PATHWAYS IS DESIRABLE. THE KINETICS OF THE VO2 +/VO2 + REDOX REACTION HAVE BEEN INVESTIGATED IN 1 M SULFURIC AND 1 M PHOSPHORIC ACID BY CYCLIC VOLTAMMETRY, CHRONOAMPEROMETRY, ELECTROCHEMICAL IMPEDANCE SPECTROSCOPY AND FLOW BATTERY TESTS. IT WAS FOUND THAT IN 1 M PHOSPHORIC ACID THE ELECTRON TRANSFER CONSTANT K0 IS UP TO 67 TIMES HIGHER THAN IN 1 M SULFURIC ACID. AT HIGHER OVER-POTENTIALS THE DETERMINED CURRENTS MATCH FOR THE TWO ELECTROLYTES. THIS OVER-POTENTIAL DEPENDENT DIFFERENCE IN ELECTRON TRANSFER CONSTANT IS EXPLAINED BY VARIABLE CONTRIBUTIONS FROM THREE REACTION MECHANISMS FOR THE OXIDATION OF VO2 + TO VO2 +, AND BY THE PRESENCE OF ADSORBED INTERMEDIATES FOR THE REDUCTION OF VO2 +. THIS STUDY SHOWS THAT THE REDOX KINETICS OF THE VO2 +/VO2 + CAN BE CONSIDERABLY ACCELERATED BY ALTERING THE CHEMICAL ENVIRONMENT OF THE VANADIUM IONS, AND THAT THIS EFFECT CAN ALSO BE TRANSFERRED INTO A FLOW BATTERY. 2017 ELSEVIER B.V."
