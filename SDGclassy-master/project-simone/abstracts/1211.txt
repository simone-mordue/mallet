"978" "SOILS ARE ONE OF THE MOST BIOLOGICALLY DIVERSE HABITATS WITHIN THE TERRESTRIAL ECOSYSTEM. ALTHOUGH SOILS ARE VITAL TO THE PROVISION OF IMPORTANT ECOSYSTEM SERVICES, THEIR DIRECT PROTECTION AND SUSTAINABLE MANAGEMENT ARE OFTEN LACKING WITHIN CONSERVATION POLICY. MANY GRASSLAND SOILS HAVE UNDERGONE CONSIDERABLE MANAGEMENT INTENSIFICATION AND ARE SUBJECT TO DEGRADATION PRESSURES. SOIL COMPACTION IS AN IMPORTANT FORM OF SOIL DEGRADATION THAT CAN REDUCE SOIL PRODUCTIVITY AND CROP YIELDS, ALTHOUGH THE IMPACTS CAN BE REVERSED THROUGH NATURAL PROCESSES AND MITIGATED THROUGH MANAGEMENT INTERVENTIONS. WHILE COMMONLY USED, SUBSTANTIAL KNOWLEDGE GAPS EXIST REGARDING THE IMPACT OF SOIL COMPACTION MITIGATION TECHNIQUES ON KEY SOIL MACROFAUNA, MANY OF THESE ORGANISMS ARE ESSENTIAL TO SOIL FUNCTION. A COMPLETE SPLIT-PLOT DESIGN WAS USED TO INVESTIGATE THE IMPACTS OF MECHANICAL LOOSENING (SUBSURFACE SOIL DISTURBANCE USING TINES OR RADIAL BLADES WITHOUT SIGNIFICANT SOIL MIXING OR INVERSION) AND POWER HARROW CULTIVATION (SHEARING AND MIXING OF SOIL TO PREPARE A SEEDBED FOR THE ESTABLISHMENT OF A DEEP-ROOTING FORB AND LEGUME MIX) ON THE ABUNDANCE AND BIOMASS OF EARTHWORMS UP TO TWO YEARS POST-TREATMENT. MECHANICAL LOOSENING WAS UNDERTAKEN AT TWO DEPTHS, C. 20 CM AND C. 35 CM AS TWO SEPARATE TREATMENTS. THERE WAS A NEGATIVE EFFECT OF MECHANICAL LOOSENING AT BOTH DEPTHS ON THE ABUNDANCE AND BIOMASS OF ANECIC EARTHWORMS, LASTING UP TO TWO YEARS POST-TREATMENT. THERE WAS NO SIGNIFICANT EFFECT OF POWER HARROW CULTIVATION ON THE ABUNDANCE OR BIOMASS OF EARTHWORMS. THESE NEGATIVE EFFECTS ARE CONSISTENT WITH OTHER STUDIES THAT HAVE SHOWN MECHANICAL LOOSENING TO BE A SOURCE OF EARTHWORM MORTALITY. ALTHOUGH THESE FINDINGS RESULTED FROM A SINGLE EPISODE OF POWER HARROW CULTIVATION AND MECHANICAL LOOSENING AT A SINGLE SITE, THE RESULTS INDICATE THAT THE MECHANICAL LOOSENING OF GRASSLAND SOIL CAN HAVE A NEGATIVE IMPACT ON IMPORTANT SOIL MACROFAUNA AND SHOULD POSSIBLY ONLY BE UNDERTAKEN WHEN THE SOIL IS IN THE MOST SEVERELY DEGRADED CONDITIONS. FURTHER WORK IS NEEDED TO DETERMINE WHETHER THE NEGATIVE IMPACT OF MECHANICAL LOOSENING IS COMMON TO MULTIPLE SITES AND SOIL TYPES AND TO LINK THE REDUCTION IN EARTHWORM NUMBER AND BIOMASS TO FUTURE SOIL FUNCTION. 2016 ELSEVIER B.V."
