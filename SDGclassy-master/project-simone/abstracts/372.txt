"827" "CELL WALLS ARE AN IMPORTANT FEATURE OF PLANT CELLS AND A MAJOR COMPONENT OF THE PLANT GLYCOME. THEY HAVE BOTH STRUCTURAL AND PHYSIOLOGICAL FUNCTIONS AND ARE CRITICAL FOR PLANT GROWTH AND DEVELOPMENT. THE DIVERSITY AND COMPLEXITY OF THESE STRUCTURES DEMAND ADVANCED HIGH-THROUGHPUT TECHNIQUES TO ANSWER QUESTIONS ABOUT THEIR STRUCTURE, FUNCTIONS AND ROLES IN BOTH FUNDAMENTAL AND APPLIED SCIENTIFIC FIELDS. MICROARRAY TECHNOLOGY PROVIDES BOTH THE HIGH-THROUGHPUT AND THE FEASIBILITY ASPECTS REQUIRED TO MEET THAT DEMAND. IN THIS CHAPTER, SOME OF THE MOST RECENT MICROARRAY-BASED TECHNIQUES RELATING TO PLANT CELL WALLS ARE DESCRIBED TOGETHER WITH AN OVERVIEW OF RELATED CONTEMPORARY TECHNIQUES APPLIED TO CARBOHYDRATE MICROARRAYS AND THEIR GENERAL POTENTIAL IN GLYCOSCIENCE. A DETAILED EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURE FOR HIGH-THROUGHPUT MAPPING OF PLANT CELL WALL GLYCANS USING THE COMPREHENSIVE MICROARRAY POLYMER PROFILING (COMPP) TECHNIQUE IS INCLUDED IN THE CHAPTER AND PROVIDES A GOOD EXAMPLE OF BOTH THE ROBUST AND HIGH-THROUGHPUT NATURE OF MICROARRAYS AS WELL AS THEIR APPLICABILITY TO PLANT GLYCOMICS.
