"1769" "THE CHAROPHYTE GREEN ALGAE (CGA, STREPTOPHYTA, VIRIDIPLANTAE) OCCUPY A KEY PHYLOGENETIC POSITION AS THE IMMEDIATE ANCESTORS OF LAND PLANTS BUT, PARADOXICALLY, ARE LESS WELL-STUDIED THAN THE OTHER MAJOR PLANT LINEAGES. THIS IS PARTICULARLY TRUE IN THE CONTEXT OF FUNCTIONAL GENOMIC STUDIES, WHERE THE LACK OF AN EFFICIENT PROTOCOL FOR THEIR STABLE GENETIC TRANSFORMATION HAS BEEN A MAJOR OBSTACLE. OBSERVATIONS OF EXTANT CGA SPECIES SUGGEST THE EXISTENCE OF SOME OF THE EVOLUTIONARY ADAPTATIONS THAT HAD TO OCCUR FOR LAND COLONIZATION, HOWEVER, TO DATE, THERE HAS BEEN NO ROBUST EXPERIMENTAL PLATFORM TO ADDRESS THIS GENETICALLY. WE PRESENT A PROTOCOL FOR HIGH-THROUGHPUT AGROBACTERIUM TUMEFACIENS-MEDIATED TRANSFORMATION OF PENIUM MARGARITACEUM, A UNICELLULAR CGA SPECIES. THE VERSATILITY OF PENIUM AS A MODEL FOR STUDYING VARIOUS ASPECTS OF PLANT CELL BIOLOGY AND DEVELOPMENT WAS ILLUSTRATED THROUGH NON-INVASIVE VISUALIZATION OF PROTEIN LOCALIZATION AND DYNAMICS IN LIVING CELLS. IN ADDITION, THE UTILITY OF RNA INTERFERENCE (RNAI) FOR REVERSE GENETIC STUDIES WAS DEMONSTRATED BY TARGETING GENES ASSOCIATED WITH CELL WALL MODIFICATION (PECTIN METHYLESTERASE) AND BIOSYNTHESIS (CELLULOSE SYNTHASE). THIS PROVIDED EVIDENCE SUPPORTING CURRENT MODELS OF CELL WALL ASSEMBLY AND INTER-POLYMER INTERACTIONS THAT WERE BASED ON STUDIES OF LAND PLANTS, BUT IN THIS CASE USING DIRECT OBSERVATION IN VIVO. THIS NEW FUNCTIONAL GENOMICS PLATFORM HAS BROAD POTENTIAL APPLICATIONS, INCLUDING STUDIES OF PLANT ORGANISMAL BIOLOGY AND THE EVOLUTIONARY INNOVATIONS REQUIRED FOR TRANSITION FROM AQUATIC TO TERRESTRIAL HABITATS. 2013 THE AUTHORS THE PLANT JOURNAL 2013 JOHN WILEY & SONS LTD."
