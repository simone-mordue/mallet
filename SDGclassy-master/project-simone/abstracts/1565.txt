"1631" "THE ROLE OF ORGANOCLAYS IN HYDROCARBON REMOVAL DURING BIODEGRADATION WAS INVESTIGATED IN AQUEOUS CLAY/OIL MICROCOSM EXPERIMENTS WITH A HYDROCARBON DEGRADING MICROORGANISM COMMUNITY. THE CLAYS USED FOR THIS STUDY WERE NA-MONTMORILLONITE AND SAPONITE. THESE TWO CLAYS WERE TREATED WITH DIDECYLDIMETHYLAMMONIUM BROMIDE TO PRODUCE ORGANOCLAYS WHICH WERE USED IN THIS STUDY. THE STUDY INDICATED THAT CLAYS WITH HIGH CATION EXCHANGE CAPACITY (CEC) SUCH AS NA-MONTMORILLONITE PRODUCED AN ORGANOMONTMORILLONITE THAT WAS INHIBITORY TO BIODEGRADATION OF THE CRUDE OIL HYDROCARBONS. EXTENSIVE HYDROPHOBIC INTERACTION BETWEEN THE ORGANIC PHASE OF THE ORGANOCLAY AND THE CRUDE OIL HYDROCARBONS IS SUGGESTED TO RENDER THE HYDROCARBONS UNAVAILABLE FOR BIODEGRADATION. HOWEVER, UNTREATED NA-MONTMORILLONITE WAS STIMULATORY TO BIODEGRADATION OF THE HYDROCARBONS AND IS BELIEVED TO HAVE DONE SO BECAUSE OF ITS HIGH SURFACE AREA FOR THE ACCUMULATION OF MICROBES AND NUTRIENTS MAKING IT EASY FOR THE MICROBES TO ACCESS THE NUTRIENTS. THIS STUDY INDICATES THAT UNLIKE UNMODIFIED MONTMORILLONITES, ORGANOMONTMORILLONITE MAY NOT SERVE ANY USEFUL PURPOSE IN THE BIOREMEDIATION OF CRUDE OIL SPILL SITES WHERE HYDROCARBON REMOVAL BY BIODEGRADATION IS DESIRED WITHIN A RAPID TIME PERIOD. 2014 ELSEVIER LTD."
