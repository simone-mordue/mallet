"925" "A NEW UNDERWATER MONITORING SYSTEM WAS CONSTRUCTED USING TIME-LAPSE PHOTOGRAPHY AND A SUITE OF OCEANOGRAPHIC INSTRUMENTS TO CHARACTERISE THE DYNAMIC RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN CHANGING ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITIONS, BIOLOGICAL ACTIVITIES AND THE PHYSICAL PRESENCE OF OFFSHORE INFRASTRUCTURE. THIS ARTICLE REPORTS THE RESULTS FROM A PILOT STUDY ON FINE-SCALE MONITORING OF FISH MOVEMENTS IN RELATION TO CHANGES IN MULTIPLE ENVIRONMENTAL PARAMETERS OBSERVED AT AN OFFSHORE OIL PLATFORM IN THE NORTH SEA. TEMPORAL CHANGES IN THE NUMBER OF SAITHE POLLACHIUS VIRENS WERE READILY OBSERVED WITH A STRONG INDICATION OF DIURNAL RHYTHM OF VERTICAL MOVEMENTS. KEY ENVIRONMENTAL PARAMETERS SUCH AS TEMPERATURE, SALINITY, CURRENTS, TIDAL CYCLE, ILLUMINATION, CHLOROPHYLL AND DISSOLVED OXYGEN ALSO VARIED SPATIALLY (I.E. DIFFERENT DEPTHS) AND/OR TEMPORALLY. IF THE MONITORING SYSTEM IS TO BE DEPLOYED SYSTEMATICALLY AT MULTIPLE OFFSHORE LOCATIONS FOR LONGER DURATION AS APPROPRIATELY CONTROLLED EXPERIMENTS, THIS APPROACH MAY GREATLY HELP UNDERSTAND THE INFLUENCE OF REDUNDANT OFFSHORE MAN-MADE STRUCTURES ON THE MARINE ECOSYSTEM. 2016 THE AUTHORS" "FINE-SCALE MONITORING OF FISH MOVEMENTS AND MULTIPLE ENVIRONMENTAL PARAMETERS AROUND A DECOMMISSIONED OFFSHORE OIL PLATFORM: A PILOT STUDY IN THE NORTH SEA" "ARTIFICIAL REEFS; ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING; FISH MOVEMENT; NORTH SEA; OFFSHORE OIL/GAS PLATFORMS; UNDERWATER OBSERVATORY"
