"421" "FLORAL NECTAR IS A REWARD OFFERED BY FLOWERING PLANTS TO VISITING POLLINATORS. NECTAR CHEMISTRY IS IMPORTANT FOR UNDERSTANDING PLANT NUTRIENT ALLOCATION AND PLANTPOLLINATOR INTERACTIONS. HOWEVER, MANY PLANT SPECIES ARE DIFFICULT TO SAMPLE AS THEIR FLOWERS ARE SMALL AND PRODUCE LOW AMOUNTS OF NECTAR. WE COMPARED THE EFFECTS OF DIFFERENT METHODS OF NECTAR COLLECTION ON THE AMINO ACID COMPOSITION OF FLOWERS WITH LOW VOLUMES OF NECTAR. WE USED FIVE METHODS TO COLLECT NECTAR FROM 60 (512) CALLUNA VULGARIS FLOWERS: MICROCAPILLARY TUBES, A LOW-VOLUME FLOWER RINSE (THE MICRO-RINSE METHOD, USING 2L WATER), FILTER PAPER, A HIGH-VOLUME FLOWER RINSE (2ML WATER) AND A FLOWER WASH (2ML WATER). WE ANALYSED THE SAMPLES FOR FREE AMINO ACIDS USING QUANTITATIVE UHPLC METHODS. WE FOUND THAT THE MICRO-RINSE METHOD (RINSING THE NECTARY WITH ENOUGH WATER TO ONLY COVER THE NECTARY) RECOVERED AMINO ACID PROPORTIONS SIMILAR TO RAW NECTAR EXTRACTED USING MICROCAPILLARY TUBES. THE FILTER PAPER, 2ML RINSE AND 2ML WASH METHODS MEASURED SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER VALUES OF FREE AMINO ACIDS AND ALSO ALTERED THE PROFILE OF AMINO ACIDS. WE DISCUSS OUR CONCERNS ABOUT THE INCREASED CONTAMINATION RISK OF THE FILTER PAPER AND HIGH-VOLUME RINSE AND WASH SAMPLES FROM DRIED NECTAR ACROSS THE FLORAL TISSUE (NECTAR UNAVAILABLE TO FLORAL VISITORS), POLLEN, VASCULAR FLUID AND CELLULAR FLUID. OUR STUDY WILL ENABLE RESEARCHERS TO MAKE INFORMED DECISIONS ABOUT NECTAR COLLECTION METHODS DEPENDING ON THEIR INTENDED CHEMICAL ANALYSIS. THESE METHODS OF SAMPLING WILL ENABLE RESEARCHERS TO EXAMINE A LARGER ARRAY OF PLANT SPECIES' FLOWERS TO INCLUDE THOSE WITH LOW VOLUMES OF NECTAR. 2017 THE AUTHORS.
