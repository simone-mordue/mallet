"1558" "EARLY WORK ON CORAL REPRODUCTION IN THE FAR NORTHERN RED SEA SUGGESTED THAT THE SPAWNING TIMES OF ECOLOGICALLY ABUNDANT SPECIES DID NOT OVERLAP, UNLIKE ON THE GREAT BARRIER REEF WHERE MANY SPECIES SPAWN WITH HIGH SYNCHRONY. IN CONTRAST, RECENT WORK IN THE NORTHERN AND CENTRAL RED SEA INDICATES A HIGH DEGREE OF SYNCHRONY IN THE REPRODUCTIVE CONDITION OF ACROPORA SPECIES: OVER 90% OF SPECIES SAMPLED IN APRIL/MAY CONTAIN MATURE GAMETES. HOWEVER, IT HAS YET TO BE DETERMINED WHEN MOST ACROPORA RELEASE THEIR GAMETES. IN ADDITION, THERE IS A LACK OF DATA FOR OTHER ECOLOGICALLY IMPORTANT SCLERACTINIAN SPECIES SUCH AS MERULINIDS AND PORITIDS. HERE, WE DOCUMENT THE DATE AND TIME OF SPAWNING FOR 51 SPECIES IN THE CENTRAL RED SEA OVER THREE CONSECUTIVE YEARS, AND THE MONTH OF SPAWNING FOR AN ADDITIONAL 17 SPECIES INFERRED FROM THE PRESENCE OF MATURE GAMETES. SPAWNING OCCURS ON NIGHTS AROUND THE FULL MOON, THE SPAWNING SEASON LASTS AT LEAST 4MONTHS FROM APRIL UNTIL JULY, AND OBSERVATIONS ARE CONSISTENT WITH THE FEW OTHER RECORDS FROM THE RED SEA. THE NUMBER OF ACROPORA SPECIES SPAWNING WAS HIGHEST IN APRIL WITH 13 SPECIES SPAWNING TWO NIGHTS BEFORE THE FULL MOON IN 2011, 13 SPECIES SPAWNING ON THE NIGHT OF THE FULL MOON IN 2012, AND EIGHT SPECIES SPAWNING FOUR NIGHTS AFTER THE FULL MOON IN 2013. THE TOTAL NUMBER OF SPECIES SPAWNING WAS HIGH IN APRIL, MAY, AND JUNE AND INVOLVED 1519 SPECIES PER MONTH IN 2012. ONLY FOUR SPECIES SPAWNED IN JULY 2012. FEW REGIONS WORLDWIDE HAVE BEEN SIMILARLY SAMPLED AND INCLUDE THE PHILIPPINES, OKINAWA IN JAPAN, AND PALAU, WHERE SPAWNING PATTERNS ARE VERY SIMILAR TO THOSE IN THE CENTRAL RED SEA AND WHERE CORALS SPAWN ON NIGHTS AROUND THE FULL MOON OVER A PERIOD OF 34MONTHS. IN PARTICULAR, IN ALL FOUR LOCATIONS, ACROPORA ARE AMONG THE FIRST SPECIES TO SPAWN. OUR RESULTS ADD TO A GROWING BODY OF EVIDENCE INDICATING THAT MULTI-SPECIES SPAWNING SYNCHRONY IS A FEATURE OF ALL SPECIOSE CORAL ASSEMBLAGES. 2014, SPRINGER-VERLAG BERLIN HEIDELBERG."
