"1187" "HELICALLY CHIRAL N,N,O,O-BORON CHELATED DIPYRROMETHENES SHOWED SOLUTION-PHASE CIRCULARLY POLARIZED LUMINESCENCE (CPL) IN THE RED REGION OF THE VISIBLE SPECTRUM ( EM (MAX) FROM 621 TO 663 NM). THE PARENT DIPYRROMETHENE IS DESYMMETRISED THROUGH O CHELATION OF BORON BY THE 3,5-ORTHO-PHENOLIC SUBSTITUENTS, INDUCING A HELICAL CHIRALITY IN THE FLUOROPHORE. THE COMBINATION OF HIGH LUMINESCENCE DISSYMMETRY FACTORS (|G LUM | UP TO 4.7 10 -3 ) AND FLUORESCENCE QUANTUM YIELDS ( F UP TO 0.73) GAVE EXCEPTIONALLY EFFICIENT CIRCULARLY POLARIZED RED EMISSION FROM THESE SIMPLE SMALL ORGANIC FLUOROPHORES, ENABLING FUTURE APPLICATION IN CPL-BASED BIOIMAGING. 2016 THE AUTHORS.
