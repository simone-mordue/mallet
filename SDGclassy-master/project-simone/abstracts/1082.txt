"1555" "PURPOSE: AMPHOTERICIN B (AMB) IS AN EFFECTIVE ANTI-FUNGAL AND ANTI-LEISHMANIAL AGENT. HOWEVER, AMB HAS LOW ORAL BIOAVAILABILITY (0.3%) AND ADVERSE EFFECTS (E.G., NEPHROTOXICITY). THE OBJECTIVES OF THIS STUDY WERE TO IMPROVE THE ORAL BIOAVAILABILITY BY ENTRAPPING AMB IN PEGYLATED (PEG) POLY LACTIDE CO GLYCOLIDE COPOLYMER (PLGA-PEG) NANOPARTICLES (NPS). THE FEASIBILITY OF DIFFERENT SURFACTANTS AND STABILIZERS ON THE MEAN PARTICLE SIZE (MPS) AND ENTRAPMENT EFFICIENCY WERE ALSO INVESTIGATED. MATERIALS AND METHODS: NPS OF AMB WERE PREPARED BY A MODIFIED EMULSIFICATION DIFFUSION METHOD EMPLOYING A VITAMIN E DERIVATIVE AS A STABILIZER. PHYSICOCHEMICAL PROPERTIES AND PARTICLE SIZE CHARACTERIZATION WERE EVALUATED USING FOURIER TRANSFORM INFRA-RED SPECTROSCOPY (FTIR), DIFFERENTIAL SCANNING CALORIMETRY, SCANNING ELECTRON MICROSCOPY AND TRANSMISSION ELECTRON MICROSCOPY. MOREOVER, IN VITRO DISSOLUTION PROFILES WERE PERFORMED FOR ALL FORMULATED AMB NPS. RESULTS: MPS OF THE PREPARED SPHERICAL PARTICLES OF AMB RANGED FROM 26.4. . 2.9 TO 1068. . 489.8. NM. AN INCREASED STIRRING RATE FAVORED AMB NPS WITH A SMALLER MPS. THERE WAS A SIGNIFICANT REDUCTION IN MPS, DRUG CONTENT AND DRUG RELEASE, WHEN AMB NPS WERE PREPARED USING THE DIBLOCK POLYMER PLGA-PEG WITH 15% PEG. ADDITION OF THREE EMULSIFYING AGENTS POLY VINYL PYRROLIDONE (PVP), VITAMIN E (TPGS) AND PLURONIC F-68 TO AMB FORMULATIONS LED TO A SIGNIFICANT REDUCTION IN PARTICLE SIZE AND INCREASE IN DRUG ENTRAPMENT EFFICIENCY (DEE) COMPARED TO ADDITION OF PVP ALONE. FTIR SPECTROSCOPY DEMONSTRATED A SUCCESSFUL LOADING OF AMB TO PEGYLATED PLGA-PEG COPOLYMERS. PLGA-PEG COPOLYMER ENTRAPMENT EFFICIENCY OF AMB WAS INCREASED UP TO 56.7%, WITH 92.7% DRUG YIELD. AFTER A SLOW INITIAL RELEASE, BETWEEN 20% AND 54% OF AMB WAS RELEASED IN VITRO WITHIN 24. H PHOSPHATE BUFFER CONTAINING 2% SODIUM DEOXYCHOLATE AND WERE BEST FIT KORSMEYER-PEPPAS MODEL. IN CONCLUSION, PLGA-PEG DIBLOCK COPOLYMER WITH 15% PEG PRODUCED A SIGNIFICANT REDUCTION (>70%) IN MPS WITH HIGHEST DRUG CONTENT. THE PERCENTAGE OF PEG IN THE COPOLYMER AND THE SURFACTANT/STABILIZER USED HAD A DIRECT EFFECT ON AMB RELEASE IN VITRO, ENTRAPMENT EFFICIENCY AND MPS. THESE DEVELOPED FORMULATIONS ARE FEASIBLE, EFFECTIVE AND IMPROVED ALTERNATIVES TO OTHER CARRIERS FOR ORAL DELIVERY OF AMB. 2014."
