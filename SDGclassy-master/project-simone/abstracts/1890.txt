"904" "WE SYNTHESISED METHACRYLATE-TERMINATED PLGA (HT-PLGA, 85:15 LA:GA, 169KDA), FOR POTENTIAL USE AS AN ADHESIVELY ATTACHED CRANIOMAXILLOFACIAL FRACTURE FIXATION PLATE. THE IN VITRO DEGRADATION OF MOLECULAR WEIGHT, PH AND FLEXURAL MODULUS WERE MEASURED OVER 6WEEKS STORAGE IN PBS AT 37C, WITH COMMERCIALLY AVAILABLE HIGH (225KDA, H-PLGA) AND LOW (116KDA, L-PLGA) MOLECULAR WEIGHT 85:15 PLGAS USED AS COMPARATORS. MOLECULAR WEIGHTS OF THE MATERIALS REDUCED OVER 6WEEKS, HT-PLGA BY 48%, H-PLGA BY 23% AND L-PLGA BY 81%. HT-PLGA AND H-PLGA EXHIBITED A NEAR CONSTANT PH (7.35) AND HAD AVERAGE FLEXURAL MODULI IN EXCESS OF 6GPA WHEN PRODUCED, SIMILAR TO THAT OF THE MANDIBLE. AFTER 1WEEK STORAGE BOTH EXHIBITED A SIGNIFICANT REDUCTION IN AVERAGE MODULUS, HOWEVER, FROM WEEKS 16 NO FURTHER SIGNIFICANT CHANGES WERE OBSERVED, THE AVERAGE MODULUS NEVER DROPPED SIGNIFICANTLY BELOW 5.5GPA. IN CONTRAST, THE L-PLGA CAUSED A PH DROP TO BELOW 7.3 BY WEEK 6 AND AN AVERAGE MODULUS DROP TO 0.6 FROM AN INITIAL 4.6GPA. CELL CULTURE USING RAT BONE MARROW STROMAL CELLS, REVEALED ALL MATERIALS WERE CYTOCOMPATIBLE AND EXHIBITED NO OSTEOGENIC POTENTIAL. WE CONCLUDE THAT OUR FUNCTIONALISED PLGA RETAINS MECHANICAL PROPERTIES WHICH ARE SUITABLE FOR USE IN CRANIOFACIAL FIXATION PLATES. 2016 ELSEVIER B.V."
