"22" "MARINE SEDIMENTS REPRESENT AN IMPORTANT SINK OF HARMFUL PETROLEUM HYDROCARBONS AFTER AN ACCIDENTAL OIL SPILL. ELECTROBIOREMEDIATION TECHNIQUES, WHICH COMBINE ELECTROKINETIC TRANSPORT AND BIODEGRADATION PROCESSES, REPRESENT AN EMERGING TECHNOLOGICAL PLATFORM FOR A SUSTAINABLE REMEDIATION OF CONTAMINATED SEDIMENTS. HERE, WE DESCRIBE THE RESULTS OF A LONG-TERM MESOCOSM-SCALE ELECTROBIOREMEDIATION EXPERIMENT FOR THE TREATMENT OF MARINE SEDIMENTS CONTAMINATED BY CRUDE OIL. A DIMENSIONALLY STABLE ANODE AND A STAINLESS-STEEL MESH CATHODE WERE EMPLOYED TO DRIVE SEAWATER ELECTROLYSIS AT A FIXED CURRENT DENSITY OF 11 A/M 2 . THIS APPROACH ALLOWED ESTABLISHING CONDITIONS CONDUCIVE TO CONTAMINANTS BIODEGRADATION, AS CONFIRMED BY THE ENRICHMENT OF ALCANIVORAX BORKUMENSIS CELLS HARBORING THE ALKB-GENE AND OTHER AEROBIC HYDROCARBONOCLASTIC BACTERIA. OIL CHEMISTRY ANALYSES INDICATED THAT AROMATIC HYDROCARBONS WERE PRIMARILY REMOVED FROM THE SEDIMENT VIA ELECTROOSMOSIS AND LOW MOLECULAR WEIGHT ALKANES (NC 6 TO NC 10 ) VIA BIODEGRADATION. 2019 ELSEVIER LTD" "COMBINING ELECTROKINETIC TRANSPORT AND BIOREMEDIATION FOR ENHANCED REMOVAL OF CRUDE OIL FROM CONTAMINATED MARINE SEDIMENTS: RESULTS OF A LONG-TERM, MESOCOSM-SCALE EXPERIMENT" "CRUDE OIL; ELECTROBIOREMEDIATION; ELECTROKINETIC REMEDIATION; MARINE SEDIMENTS"
