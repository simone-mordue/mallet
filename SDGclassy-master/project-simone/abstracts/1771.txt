"897" "TWO ACIDOPHILIC ACTINOBACTERIA, ISOLATES NA14 AND NF37T, WERE THE SUBJECT OF A POLYPHASIC TAXONOMIC STUDY. CHEMOTAXONOMIC AND MORPHOLOGICAL PROPERTIES OF THE ISOLATES WERE CHARACTERISTIC OF THE GENUS STREPTACIDIPHILUS. THE ISOLATES WERE SHOWN TO HAVE IDENTICAL 16S RRNA GENE SEQUENCES AND TO BE CLOSELY RELATED TO STREPTACIDIPHILUS NEUTRINIMICUS DSM 41755T (&GT,99.9%). HOWEVER, DNA:DNA RELATEDNESS BETWEEN ISOLATE NF37T AND THE TYPE STRAIN OF S. NEUTRINIMICUS WAS FOUND TO BE LOW AT 11.1 (3.5)%. A BROAD RANGE OF PHENOTYPIC FEATURES WERE SHOWN TO DISTINGUISH THE ISOLATES FROM THEIR CLOSE PHYLOGENETIC NEIGHBOURS. THESE DATA SHOWN THAT THE ISOLATES FORM A NOVEL SPECIES OF STREPTACIDIPHILUS FOR WHICH THE NAME STREPTACIDIPHILUS TORUNIENSIS SP. NOV. IS PROPOSED. THE TYPE STRAIN IS NF37T (=DSM 102291T=NCIMB 15025T). 2016, THE AUTHOR(S)." "STREPTACIDIPHILUS TORUNIENSIS SP.
