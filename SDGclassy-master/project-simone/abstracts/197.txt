"1716" "AN OXYGEN-TOLERANT RESPIRATORY [NIFE]-HYDROGENASE IS PROVEN TO BE A FOUR-ELECTRON HYDROGEN/OXYGEN OXIDOREDUCTASE, CATALYZING THE REACTION 2 H 2 + O2=2 H2O, EQUIVALENT TO HYDROGEN COMBUSTION, OVER A SUSTAINED PERIOD WITHOUT INACTIVATING. AT LEAST 86% OF THE H2O PRODUCED BY ESCHERICHIA COLI HYDROGENASE-1 EXPOSED TO A MIXTURE OF 90% H2 AND 10% O2 IS ACCOUNTED FOR BY A DIRECT FOUR-ELECTRON PATHWAY, WHEREAS UP TO 14% ARISES FROM SLOWER SIDE REACTIONS PROCEEDING VIA SUPEROXIDE AND HYDROGEN PEROXIDE. THE DIRECT PATHWAY IS ASSIGNED TO O2 REDUCTION AT THE [NIFE] ACTIVE SITE, WHEREAS THE SIDE REACTIONS ARE AN UNAVOIDABLE CONSEQUENCE OF THE PRESENCE OF LOW-POTENTIAL RELAY CENTERS THAT RELEASE ELECTRONS DERIVED FROM H2 OXIDATION. THE OXIDASE ACTIVITY IS TOO SLOW TO BE USEFUL IN REMOVING O2 FROM THE BACTERIAL PERIPLASM, INSTEAD, THE FOUR-ELECTRON REDUCTION OF MOLECULAR OXYGEN TO HARMLESS WATER ENSURES THAT THE ACTIVE SITE SURVIVES TO CATALYZE SUSTAINED HYDROGEN OXIDATION."
