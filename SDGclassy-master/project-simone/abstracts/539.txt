"1066" "EXCESSIVE MOUNTING BEHAVIOURS AMONGST PIGS CAUSE A HIGH RISK OF POOR WELFARE, ARISING FROM SKIN LESIONS, LAMENESS AND STRESS, AND ECONOMIC LOSSES FROM REDUCED PERFORMANCE. THE AIM OF THIS STUDY WAS TO DEVELOP A METHOD FOR AUTOMATIC DETECTION OF MOUNTING EVENTS AMONGST PIGS UNDER COMMERCIAL FARM CONDITIONS BY MEANS OF IMAGE PROCESSING. TWO PENS WERE SELECTED FOR THE STUDY AND WERE MONITORED FOR 20 DAYS BY MEANS OF TOP VIEW CAMERAS. THE RECORDED VIDEO WAS THEN VISUALLY ANALYSED FOR SELECTING MOUNTING BEHAVIOURS, AND EXTRACTED IMAGES FROM THE VIDEO FILES WERE SUBSEQUENTLY USED FOR IMAGE PROCESSING. AN ELLIPSE FITTING TECHNIQUE WAS APPLIED TO LOCALIZE PIGS IN THE IMAGE. THE INTERSECTION POINTS BETWEEN THE MAJOR AND MINOR AXIS OF EACH FITTED ELLIPSE AND THE ELLIPSE SHAPE WERE USED FOR DEFINING THE HEAD, TAIL AND SIDES OF EACH PIG. THE EUCLIDEAN DISTANCES BETWEEN HEAD AND TAIL, HEAD AND SIDES, THE MAJOR AND MINOR AXIS LENGTH OF THE FITTED ELLIPSE DURING THE MOUNTING WERE UTILIZED FOR DEVELOPMENT OF AN ALGORITHM TO AUTOMATICALLY IDENTIFY A MOUNTING EVENT. THE PROPOSED METHOD COULD DETECT MOUNTING EVENTS WITH HIGH LEVEL OF SENSITIVITY, SPECIFICITY AND ACCURACY, 94.5%, 88.6% AND 92.7%, RESPECTIVELY. THE RESULTS SHOW THAT IT IS POSSIBLE TO USE MACHINE VISION TECHNIQUES IN ORDER TO AUTOMATICALLY DETECT MOUNTING BEHAVIOURS AMONG PIGS UNDER COMMERCIAL FARM CONDITIONS. 2016 ELSEVIER B.V."
