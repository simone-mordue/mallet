CLUSTERS 58 ARE FORMED VIA HYDROGENATION AND OPENING OF THE PHOSPHIRANE RING IN CLUSTERS (S)-2 AND (R)-3. THE PHOSPHIRANE-SUBSTITUTED CLUSTERS WERE FOUND TO BE ABLE TO CATALYZE THE HYDROGENATION OF TRANS-2-METHYL-2-BUTENOIC ACID (TIGLIC ACID), BUT NO ENANTIOSELECTIVITY COULD BE DETECTED. THE MOLECULAR STRUCTURES OF (S)-4, (R,SP)-7 AND 9 HAVE BEEN DETERMINED AND ARE PRESENTED. 2017 ELSEVIER B.V."
