"1748" "INHIBITION OF DNA REPAIR IS AN ATTRACTIVE THERAPEUTIC APPROACH TO ENHANCE THE ACTIVITY OF DNA-DAMAGING ANTICANCER CHEMOTHERAPEUTIC AGENTS. SIMILARLY, BLOCKADE OF THE MULTIDRUG-RESISTANCE PROTEIN 1 (MDR1) CAN OVERCOME EFFLUX-MEDIATED RESISTANCE. DNA-DEPENDENT PROTEIN KINASE (DNA-PK) IS ESSENTIAL FOR THE NON-HOMOLOGOUS END-JOINING DNA REPAIR PATHWAY. NU7441 IS A POTENT DNA-PK INHIBITOR (IC50=14 NM) THAT IS USED WIDELY TO STUDY THE EFFECTS OF DNA-PK INHIBITION IN VITRO. IN GROWTH INHIBITION STUDIES, 1 M NU7441 SENSITISED VINCRISTINE-RESISTANT CCRF-CEM VCR/R LEUKAEMIA CELLS (1200-FOLD RESISTANT) TO A RANGE OF MDR1 SUBSTRATES, INCLUDING DOXORUBICIN (8-FOLD, P=0.03), VINCRISTINE (14-FOLD, P=0.01) AND ETOPOSIDE (63-FOLD, P=0.02), COMPARED WITH 1.4-FOLD (P=0.02), 2.2-FOLD (P=0.04) AND 3.6-FOLD (P=0.01) SENSITISATION, RESPECTIVELY, IN PARENTAL CCRF-CEM CELLS. THIS DIFFERENCE IN NU7441 SENSITIVITY WAS CONFIRMED IN ANOTHER TWO PARENTAL AND MDR1-OVEREXPRESSING CELL LINE PAIRS. A DOXORUBICIN FLUORESCENCE ASSAY SHOWED THAT IN MDR1-OVEREXPRESSING CANINE KIDNEY MDCKII-MDR1 CELLS, 1 M NU7441 INCREASED DOXORUBICIN NUCLEAR FLUORESCENCE 16-FOLD. NU7441 AND 3 STRUCTURALLY RELATED COMPOUNDS (NU7742 (AN NU7441 ANALOGUE THAT DOES NOT INHIBIT DNA-PK - IC 50 &GT, 10 M), DRN1 (DNA-PK-INHIBITORY ATROPISOMERIC NU7441 DERIVATIVE - IC50=2 NM) AND DRN2 (DNA-PK NON-INHIBITORY ATROPISOMERIC NU7441 DERIVATIVE - IC50=7 M)) ALL INCREASED INTRACELLULAR VINCRISTINE ACCUMULATION IN THE CCRF-CEM VCR/R CELLS TO A LEVEL SIMILAR TO VERAPAMIL, AS MEASURED BY LC-MS. THIS PAPER DEMONSTRATES THAT NU7441 IS A DUAL DNA-PK AND MDR1 INHIBITOR, AND THIS EXTENDS THE THERAPEUTIC POTENTIAL OF THE COMPOUND WHEN USED IN COMBINATION WITH MDR SUBSTRATES. 2014 ELSEVIER INC."
