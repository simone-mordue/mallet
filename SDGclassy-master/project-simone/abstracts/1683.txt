"1211" "THIS ARTICLE CONTRIBUTES TO THE EXISTING LITERATURE ON GEOGRAPHICAL INDICATIONS BY OBSERVING CONSUMERS STATED PREFERENCE FOR EXTRA-VIRGIN OLIVE OIL IN TWO GROUPS DIFFERING IN THEIR REGIONAL IDENTITY. IN PARTICULAR, CONSUMERS FROM TWO GROUPS WERE ASKED TO RANK PRODUCTS IN A CONTINGENT RANKING SURVEY. ONE GROUP (INSIDERS, SICILIAN CONSUMERS) SHARED ORIGIN WITH A GOOD PRODUCT (SICILIAN OIL), THE OTHER GROUP (OUTSIDERS, ROME AND MILAN) PRESENTED NO ASSOCIATION CONSUMER-PRODUCT. RESULTS INDICATE THAT INSIDERS ARE WILLING TO PAY MORE FOR GOODS ORIGINATING FROM THE REGION THEY IDENTIFY WITH COMPARED WITH A REGION ASSOCIATED WITH OUTSIDERS. IDENTITY SEEMS TO GIVE A BIAS BY WHICH A LOCAL PRODUCT IS NOT NECESSARILY PERCEIVED AS SUPERIOR IN ABSOLUTE TERMS, BUT IN RELATIVE TERMS: OUTSIDE PRODUCTS ARE NEVER CONSIDERED BETTER THAN INSIDE OPTIONS BUT ARE EITHER INFERIOR OR EQUAL IN PERCEIVED VALUE. 2016, COPYRIGHT TAYLOR & FRANCIS GROUP, LLC."
