"1788" "REACTION OF 1,1-FERROCENEDICARBONYL CHLORIDE WITH 3-ETHYL-2,4-DIMETHYLPYRROLE IN DCM PRODUCED THE HALF-WAY PRODUCT, NAMELY, THE FERROCENE BIS(2-KETOPYRROLE) DERIVATIVE 2 AND NOT THE EXPECTED BIS(DIPYRROMETHENE) COMPOUND. THE 2-KETOPYRROLE COMPOUND READILY REACTED WITH BF3ET2O TO PRODUCE THE BIS(DIFLUOROPYRROLO)-OXABOROLE COMPOUND, FBF, AS A RED/BROWN SOLID WHICH WAS CHARACTERISED BY X-RAY CRYSTALLOGRAPHY. 57FE MSSBAUER SPECTRA FOR 2 AND FBF WERE CONSISTENT WITH LOW-SPIN IRON(II) (D6) FERROCENE DERIVATIVES. A CYCLIC VOLTAMMOGRAM FOR 2 IN ACETONITRILE REVEALED A REVERSIBLE WAVE AT +0.31 V VS. FC+/FC (FERROCENE-BASED) AND AN IRREVERSIBLE WAVE AT -2.38 V VS. FC+/FC (KETOPYRROLE-BASED). THE ELECTROCHEMICAL BEHAVIOUR IS SEVERELY PERTURBED BY THE CHELATION OF THE BF2 GROUPS. ALTERATIONS TO THE ELECTRONIC PROPERTIES OF 2 BY FORMATION OF FBF ARE ALSO EVIDENT IN THE ABSORPTION PROFILES. DFT CALCULATIONS [B3PW91, 6-31G(3DF)] SUPPORT THE OBSERVED CHANGES IN THE ELECTROCHEMISTRY FINDINGS AND THE MSSBAUER SPECTROSCOPIC DATA. REACTION OF 1,1-FERROCENEDICARBONYL CHLORIDE WITH 3-ETHYL-2,4-DIMETHYLPYRROLE PRODUCES THE BIS(KETOPYRROLE) COMPOUND. CHELATION OF BF2 TO THE KETOPYRROLE UNITS FORMS THE DIFLUOROPYRROLO-OXABOROLE. 2014 WILEY-VCH VERLAG GMBH & CO. KGAA, WEINHEIM."
