"829" "EXPOSURE TO SYNTHETIC CHEMICALS IS A KEY ENVIRONMENTAL CHALLENGE FACED BY AQUATIC ORGANISMS. THE TIME AND DOSE EFFECTS OF THE PHARMACEUTICALS DICLOFENAC, IBUPROFEN, AND SILDENAFIL CITRATE ON SPERM MOTILITY AND SUCCESSFUL FERTILISATION ARE STUDIED USING THE ECHINODERMS, ASTERIAS RUBENS AND PSAMMECHINUS MILIARIS, AND THE POLYCHAETE WORM ARENICOLA MARINA, ALL IMPORTANT COMPONENTS OF THE MARINE BENTHOS. MOTILITY WAS REDUCED FOR ALL SPECIES WHEN EXPOSED TO DICLOFENAC CONCENTRATIONS 0.1G/L. EXPOSURE TO 1.0G/L OF IBUPROFEN AFFECTED ONLY P.MILIARIS GAMETES AND FERTILISATION SUCCESS OF A.MARINA. A.RUBENS AND P.MILIARIS SPERM INCREASED IN BOTH PERCENTAGE MOTILITY AND SWIMMING VELOCITY WHEN EXPOSED TO SILDENAFIL CITRATE AT CONCENTRATIONS 18 AND50NG/L, RESPECTIVELY. PRE-INCUBATION OF SPERM WITH SILDENAFIL CITRATE SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASED FERTILISATION SUCCESS IN A.RUBENS AND P.MILIARIS BUT NOT IN A.MARINA. PRE-INCUBATED A.RUBENS OOCYTES FERTILISED SUCCESSFULLY IN IBUPROFEN. ACCORDING TO EU DIRECTIVE 93/67/EEC, DICLOFENAC IS CLASSIFIED AS A VERY TOXIC SUBSTANCE TO GAMETES OF A.RUBENS, P. MILIARIS, AND A.MARINA (EC50=1001000G/L) WHILE IBUPROFEN IS CLASSIFIED AS VERY TOXIC TO GAMETES OF P.MILIARIS BUT NON-TOXIC TO GAMETES OF A.MARINA (EC50&GT,10,000G/L). THE PRESENT STUDY INDICATES THAT DICLOFENAC EXPOSURE MAY HAVE NEGATIVE IMPACTS ON INVERTEBRATE REPRODUCTIVE SUCCESS, WHEREAS IBUPROFEN POTENTIALLY MAY COMPROMISE P.MILIARIS REPRODUCTION. THIS STUDY PROVIDES A VALUABLE INSIGHT INTO THE MECHANISMS THAT ALLOW MARINE INVERTEBRATES TO SURVIVE AND REPRODUCE IN CONTAMINATED AND CHANGING HABITATS. 2017 ELSEVIER LTD" "ASSESSING THE IMPACT OF DICLOFENAC, IBUPROFEN AND SILDENAFIL CITRATE (VIAGRA) ON THE FERTILISATION BIOLOGY OF BROADCAST SPAWNING MARINE INVERTEBRATES" "BENTHOS; DRUGS; MARINE INVERTEBRATE; NSAID; PHARMACEUTICALS; SPERM MOTILITY"
