"706" "SOIL PHOSPHORUS (P) FERTILITY ARISING FROM HISTORIC P INPUTS IS A MAJOR DRIVER OF P MOBILISATION IN AGRICULTURAL RUNOFF AND INCREASES THE RISK OF AQUATIC EUTROPHICATION. TO DETERMINE THE ENVIRONMENTAL BENEFIT OF LOWERING SOIL P FERTILITY, A META-ANALYSIS OF THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN SOIL TEST P (MEASURED AS OLSEN-P) AND P CONCENTRATIONS IN AGRICULTURAL DRAINFLOW AND SURFACE RUNOFF IN MOSTLY UK SOILS WAS UNDERTAKEN IN RELATION TO CURRENT EUTROPHICATION CONTROL TARGETS (30-35 G P L-1). AT AGRONOMIC-OPTIMUM OLSEN P (16-25 MG KG-1), CONCENTRATIONS OF SOLUBLE REACTIVE P (SRP), TOTAL DISSOLVED P (TDP), TOTAL P (TP) AND SEDIMENT-P (SS-P) IN RUNOFF WERE PREDICTED BY LINEAR REGRESSION ANALYSIS TO VARY BETWEEN 24 AND 183 G L-1, 38 AND 315 G L-1, 0.2 AND 9.6 MG L-1, AND 0.31 AND 3.2 G KG-1, RESPECTIVELY. CONCENTRATIONS OF SRP AND TDP IN RUNOFF WERE MUCH MORE SENSITIVE TO CHANGES IN OLSEN-P THAN WERE TP AND SS-P CONCENTRATIONS, WHICH CONFIRMS THAT SEPARATE STRATEGIES ARE REQUIRED FOR MITIGATING THE MOBILISATION OF DISSOLVED AND PARTICULATE P FORMS. AS THE MAIN DRIVER OF EUTROPHICATION, SRP CONCENTRATIONS IN RUNOFF WERE REDUCED ON AVERAGE BY 60 G L-1 (71%) BY LOWERING SOIL OLSEN-P FROM OPTIMUM (25 MG KG-1) TO 10 MG KG-1. AT OLSEN-P CONCENTRATIONS BELOW 12 MG KG-1, DISSOLVED HYDROLYSABLE P (LARGELY ORGANIC) BECAME THE DOMINANT FORM OF SOLUBLE P TRANSPORTED. WE CONCLUDED THAT MAINTAINING AGRONOMIC-OPTIMUM OLSEN-P COULD STILL POSE A EUTROPHICATION RISK, AND THAT A GREATER RESEARCH FOCUS ON REDUCING CRITICAL SOIL TEST P THROUGH INNOVATIVE AGRO-ENGINEERING OF SOILS, CROPS AND FERTILISERS WOULD GIVE LONG-TERM BENEFITS IN REDUCING THE ENDEMIC EUTROPHICATION RISK ARISING FROM LEGACY SOIL P. SOIL P TESTING SHOULD BECOME COMPULSORY IN PRIORITY CATCHMENTS SUFFERING, OR SENSITIVE TO, EUTROPHICATION TO ENSURE SOIL P RESERVES ARE FULLY ACCOUNTED FOR AS PART OF GOOD FERTILISER AND MANURE MANAGEMENT. 2017 IOP PUBLISHING LTD."
