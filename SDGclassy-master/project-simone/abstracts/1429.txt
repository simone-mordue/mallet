"1126" "THE GLYCYL RADICAL ENZYME-CATALYZED ADDITION OF N-ALKANES TO FUMARATE CREATES A C-C-BOND BETWEEN TWO CONCOMITANTLY FORMED STEREOGENIC CARBON CENTERS. THE CONFIGURATIONS OF THE TWO DIASTEREOISOMERS OF THE PRODUCT RESULTING FROM N-HEXANE ACTIVATION BY THE N-ALKANE-UTILIZING DENITRIFYING BACTERIUM STRAIN HXN1, I.E. (1-METHYLPENTYL)SUCCINATE, WERE ASSIGNED AS (2S,1R) AND (2R,1R). EXPERIMENTS WITH STEREOSPECIFICALLY DEUTERATED N-(2,5- 2 H 2 )HEXANES REVEALED THAT EXCLUSIVELY THE PRO-S HYDROGEN ATOM IS ABSTRACTED FROM C2 OF THE N-ALKANE BY THE ENZYME AND LATER TRANSFERRED BACK TO C3 OF THE ALKYLSUCCINATE FORMED. THESE RESULTS INDICATE THAT THE ALKYLSUCCINATE-FORMING REACTION PROCEEDS WITH AN INVERSION OF CONFIGURATION AT THE CARBON ATOM (C2) OF THE N-ALKANE FORMING THE NEW C-C-BOND, AND THUS STEREOCHEMICALLY RESEMBLES A S N 2-TYPE REACTION. THEREFORE, THE REACTION MAY OCCUR IN A CONCERTED MANNER, WHICH MAY AVOID THE HIGHLY ENERGETIC HEX-2-YL RADICAL AS AN INTERMEDIATE. THE REACTION IS ASSOCIATED WITH A SIGNIFICANT PRIMARY KINETIC ISOTOPE EFFECT (KH/KD 3) FOR HYDROGEN, INDICATING THAT THE HOMOLYTIC C-H-BOND CLEAVAGE IS INVOLVED IN THE FIRST IRREVERSIBLE STEP OF THE REACTION MECHANISM. THE (1-METHYLALKYL)SUCCINATE SYNTHASES OF N-ALKANE-UTILIZING ANAEROBIC BACTERIA APPARENTLY HAVE VERY BROAD SUBSTRATE RANGES ENABLING THEM TO ACTIVATE NOT ONLY ALIPHATIC BUT ALSO ALKYL-AROMATIC HYDROCARBONS. THUS, TWO DENITRIFIERS AND ONE SULFATE REDUCER WERE SHOWN TO CONVERT THE NONGROWTH SUBSTRATE TOLUENE TO BENZYLSUCCINATE AND FURTHER TO THE DEAD-END PRODUCT BENZOYL-COA. FOR THIS PURPOSE, HOWEVER, THE MODIFIED -OXIDATION PATHWAY KNOWN FROM ALKYLBENZENE-UTILIZING BACTERIA WAS NOT EMPLOYED, BUT RATHER THE PATHWAY USED FOR N-ALKANE DEGRADATION INVOLVING COA LIGATION, CARBON SKELETON REARRANGEMENT AND DECARBOXYLATION. FURTHERMORE, VARIOUS N-ALKANE- AND ALKYLBENZENE-UTILIZING DENITRIFIERS AND SULFATE REDUCERS WERE FOUND TO BE CAPABLE OF FORMING BENZYL ALCOHOLS FROM DIVERSE ALKYLBENZENES, PUTATIVELY VIA DEHYDROGENASES. THE THERMOPHILIC SULFATE REDUCER STRAIN TD3 FORMS N-ALKYLSUCCINATES DURING GROWTH WITH N-ALKANES OR CRUDE OIL, WHICH, BASED ON THE OBSERVED PATTERNS OF HOMOLOGS, DO NOT DERIVE FROM A TERMINAL ACTIVATION OF N-ALKANES. 2016 S.
