"1277" "TWO KINDS OF CAAL LAYERED DOUBLE HYDROXIDES (CAAL-LDHS) WERE SYNTHESIZED WITH CHLORIDE AND NITRATE ANIONS BY CO-PRECIPITATION METHOD. THE SAMPLES WERE CALCINED AND FINALLY RECONSTRUCTED BY REHYDRATION USING ULTRASOUNDS, IN THE PRESENCE OF NACL OR NANO3. RECONSTRUCTED SAMPLES PRESENTED SMALLER LAMELLA SIZE THAN THE PARENT ONES. ALL SAMPLES WERE CHARACTERIZED BY X-RAY POWDER DIFFRACTION, FT-IR SPECTROSCOPY, THERMOGRAVIMETRIC ANALYSIS AND TEM MICROSCOPY. DELAMINATION WAS NOT ACHIEVED BY MECHANICAL STIRRING FOR 2DAYS, WHEREAS MOST SAMPLES UNDERWENT DELAMINATION BY THE USE OF ULTRASOUNDS. ADDITIONALLY, A HYBRID CAAL-LDHS WITH CDTE QUANTUM DOTS WAS SYNTHESIZED BY RECONSTRUCTION OF A CALCINED CAAL-LDHS IN THE PRESENCE OF THE QUANTUM DOTS. 2015 ELSEVIER B.V."
