LEAD COMPOUNDS SHOW CELLULAR ACTIVITY CONSISTENT WITH THEIR PI4K POTENCY INHIBITING THE ACCUMULATION OF IP1 AFTER PDGF STIMULATION AND REDUCING CELLULAR PIP, PIP2 AND PIP3 LEVELS. HENCE, THESE COMPOUNDS ARE USEFUL IN VITRO TOOLS TO DELINEATE THE COMPLEX BIOLOGICAL PATHWAYS INVOLVED IN SIGNALLING THROUGH PI4K. 2015 ELSEVIER LTD."
