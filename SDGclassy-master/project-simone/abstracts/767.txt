"1772" "ISOTOPE DILUTION IS CURRENTLY THE MOST ACCURATE TECHNIQUE IN HUMANS TO DETERMINE VITAMIN A STATUS AND BIOAVAILABILITY/ BIOCONVERSION OF PROVITAMIN A CAROTENOIDS SUCH AS -CAROTENE. HOWEVER, LIMITS OF MS DETECTION, COUPLED WITH EXTENSIVE ISOLATION PROCEDURES, HAVE HINDERED INVESTIGATIONS OF PHYSIOLOGICALLY-RELEVANT DOSES OF STABLE ISOTOPES IN LARGE INTERVENTION TRIALS. HERE, A SENSITIVE LIQUID CHROMATOGRAPHY- TANDEM MASS SPECTROMETRY (LC/MS/MS) ANALYTICAL METHOD WAS DEVELOPED TO STUDY THE PLASMA RESPONSE FROM COADMINISTERED ORAL DOSES OF 2 MG [ 13 C 10 ] -CAROTENE AND 1 MG [ 13 C 10 ]RETINYL ACETATE IN HUMAN SUBJECTS OVER A 2 WEEK PERIOD. A REVERSE PHASE C 18 COLUMN AND BINARY MOBILE PHASE SOLVENT SYSTEM SEPARATED -CAROTENE, RETINOL, RETINYL ACETATE, RETINYL LINOLEATE, RETINYL PALMITATE/RETINYL OLEATE, AND RETINYL STEARATE WITHIN A 7 MIN RUN TIME. SELECTED REACTION MONITORING OF ANALYTES WAS PERFORMED UNDER ATMOSPHERIC PRESSURE CHEMICAL IONIZATION IN POSITIVE MODE AT M/Z 537 ? 321 AND M/Z 269 ? 93 FOR RESPECTIVE [ 12 C] -CAROTENE AND [ 12 C] RETINOIDS, M/Z 547 ? 330 AND M/Z 274 ? 98 FOR [ 13 C 10 ] -CAROTENE AND [ 13 C 5 ] CLEAVAGE PRODUCTS, AND M/Z 279 ? 100 FOR METABOLITES OF [ 13 C 10 ]RETINYL ACETATE. A SINGLE ONE-PHASE SOLVENT EXTRACTION, WITH NO SAPONIFICATION OR PURIFICATION STEPS, LEFT RETINYL ESTERS INTACT FOR DETERMINATION OF INTESTINALLY-DERIVED RETINOL IN CHYLOMICRONS VERSUS RETINOL FROM THE LIVER BOUND TO RETINOL BINDING PROTEIN. COADMINISTRATION OF [ 13 C 10 ] RETINYL ACETATE WITH [ 13 C 10 ] -CAROTENE NOT ONLY ACTS AS A REFERENCE DOSE FOR INTER-INDIVIDUAL VARIATIONS IN ABSORPTION AND CHYLOMICRON CLEARANCE RATES, BUT ALSO ALLOWS FOR SIMULTANEOUS DETERMINATION OF AN INDIVIDUAL'S VITAMIN A STATUS. - OXLEY, A., P.
