"360" "RAPID GROWTH OF HYDRAULIC FRACTURING FOR SHALE GAS WITHIN THE USA AND THE POSSIBILITY OF SHALE DEVELOPMENTS WITHIN EUROPE HAS CREATED PUBLIC CONCERN ABOUT THE RISKS OF SPILLS AND LEAKS ASSOCIATED WITH THE INDUSTRY. REPORTS FROM THE TEXAS RAILROAD COMMISSION (1999 TO 2015) AND THE COLORADO OIL AND GAS COMMISSION (2009 TO 2015) WERE USED TO EXAMINE SPILL RATES FROM OIL AND GAS WELL PADS. POLLUTION INCIDENT RECORDS FOR ENGLAND AND ROAD TRANSPORT INCIDENT DATA FOR THE UK WERE EXAMINED AS AN ANALOGUE FOR POTENTIAL OFFSITE SPILLS ASSOCIATED WITH TRANSPORT FOR A DEVELOPING SHALE INDUSTRY. THE TEXAS AND COLORADO SPILL DATA SHOWS THAT THE SPILL RATE ON THE WELL PADS HAS INCREASED OVER THE RECORDED TIME PERIOD. THE MOST COMMON SPILL CAUSE WAS EQUIPMENT FAILURE. WITHIN COLORADO 33% OF THE SPILLS RECORDED WERE FOUND DURING WELL PAD REMEDIATION AND RANDOM SITE INSPECTIONS. BASED ON DATA FROM THE TEXAS RAILROAD COMMISSION, A UK SHALE INDUSTRY DEVELOPING WELL PADS WITH 10 LATERAL WELLS WOULD LIKELY EXPERIENCE A SPILL FOR EVERY 16 WELL PADS DEVELOPED. THE SAME WELL PAD DEVELOPMENT SCENARIO IS ESTIMATED TO REQUIRE AT LEAST 2856 TANKER MOVEMENTS OVER TWO YEARS PER WELL PAD. CONSIDERING THIS TANKER MOVEMENT ESTIMATE WITH INCIDENT AND SPILL FREQUENCY DATA FROM UK MILK TANKERS, A UK SHALE INDUSTRY WOULD LIKELY EXPERIENCE AN INCIDENT ON THE ROAD FOR EVERY 12 WELL PADS DEVELOPED AND A ROAD SPILL FOR EVERY 19 WELL PADS DEVELOPED. CONSEQUENTLY, SHOULD A UK SHALE INDUSTRY BE DEVELOPED IT IS IMPORTANT THAT APPROPRIATE MITIGATION STRATEGIES ARE IN PLACE TO MINIMISE THE RISK OF SPILLS ASSOCIATED WITH WELL PAD ACTIVITIES AND FLUID TRANSPORTATION MOVEMENTS. 2018 THE AUTHORS" "THE POTENTIAL FOR SPILLS AND LEAKS OF CONTAMINATED LIQUIDS FROM SHALE GAS DEVELOPMENTS" "HYDRAULIC FRACTURING; LEAKS; SHALE GAS; SPILLS; TRANSPORTATION; WELL PAD"
