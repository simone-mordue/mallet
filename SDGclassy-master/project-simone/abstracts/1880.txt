"944" "WE REPORT THAT AN ULTRAFAST KINETICS OF REVERSIBLE METAL-ION INSERTION CAN BE REALIZED IN ANATASE TITANIUM DIOXIDE (TIO2). NIOBIUM IONS (NB5+) WERE CAREFULLY CHOSEN TO DOPE AND DRIVE ANATASE TIO2 INTO VERY THIN NANOSHEETS STANDING PERPENDICULARLY ONTO TRANSPARENT CONDUCTIVE ELECTRODE (TCE) AND SIMULTANEOUSLY CONSTRUCT TIO2 WITH AN ION-CONDUCTING SURFACE TOGETHER WITH EXPANDED ION DIFFUSION CHANNELS, WHICH ENABLED ULTRAFAST METAL IONS TO DIFFUSE ACROSS THE ELECTROLYTE/SOLID INTERFACE AND INTO THE BULK OF TIO2. TO DEMONSTRATE THE SUPERIOR METAL-ION INSERTION RATE, THE ELECTROCHROMIC FEATURES INDUCED BY ION INTERCALATION WERE EXAMINED, WHICH EXHIBITED THE BEST COLOR SWITCHING SPEED OF 4.82 S FOR COLORATION AND 0.91 S FOR BLEACHING AMONG ALL REPORTED NANOSIZED TIO2 DEVICES. WHEN PERFORMED AS THE ANODE FOR THE SECONDARY BATTERY, THE MODIFIED TIO2 WAS CAPABLE TO DELIVER A HIGHLY REVERSIBLE CAPACITY OF 61.2 MAH/G AT AN ULTRAHIGH SPECIFIC CURRENT RATE OF 60 C (10.2 A/G). THIS FAST METAL-ION INSERTION BEHAVIOR WAS SYSTEMATICALLY INVESTIGATED BY THE WELL-CONTROLLED ELECTROCHEMICAL APPROACHES, WHICH QUANTITATIVELY REVEALED BOTH THE ENHANCED SURFACE KINETICS AND BULK ION DIFFUSION RATE. OUR STUDY COULD PROVIDE A FACILE METHODOLOGY TO MODULATE THE ION DIFFUSION KINETICS FOR METAL OXIDES. 2016 AMERICAN CHEMICAL SOCIETY."
