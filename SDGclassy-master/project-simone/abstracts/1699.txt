"1710" "THIS PAPER DEMONSTRATES A NOVEL POLYMER ELECTROLYTE MEMBRANE (PEM) BASED METHANOL ELECTROLYZER STACK WITH A CATALYZED MEMBRANE FOR HYDROGEN PRODUCTION. THE PHYSICAL AND ELECTROCHEMICAL PROPERTIES OF THE CATALYZED MEMBRANE, SINGLE CELL AND STACK ARE EXAMINED USING VARIOUS CHARACTERIZATION TECHNIQUES, SUCH AS X-RAY DIFFRACTION, SCANNING ELECTRON MICROSCOPY WITH EDX AND POLARIZATION STUDIES. THE RESULTS DEMONSTRATE THAT THE WITH PT-CATALYZED MEMBRANE ELECTRODE ASSEMBLY (MEA) EXHIBITS SIGNIFICANTLY BETTER PERFORMANCE THAN A NORMAL MEA. THE DEVELOPED ELECTROLYZER STACK PRODUCES 102 L H-1 OF 99% PURE HYDROGEN WITHOUT CO AND CO2. THE EXCELLENT STABILITY OF THE PEM METHANOL ELECTROLYZER SYSTEM IS DEMONSTRATED BY RUNNING THE STACK FOR 2500 H OF INTERMITTENT OPERATION WITH CONSTANT CURRENT DENSITY. 2013 ELSEVIER B.V.
