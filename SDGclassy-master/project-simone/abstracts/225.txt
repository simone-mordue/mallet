"1183" "ASPECTS OF BETWEEN-INDIVIDUAL TROPHIC NICHE WIDTH CAN BE EXPLORED THROUGH THE ISOTOPIC NICHE CONCEPT. IN MANY CASES ISOTOPIC VARIABILITY CAN BE INFLUENCED BY THE SCALE OF SAMPLING AND BIOLOGICAL CHARACTERISTICS INCLUDING BODY SIZE OR SEX. SAMPLE SIZE-CORRECTED (SEAC) AND BAYESIAN (SEAB) STANDARD ELLIPSE AREAS AND GENERALISED LEAST SQUARES (GLS) MODELS WERE USED TO EXPLORE THE SPATIAL VARIABILITY OF 13C AND 15N IN KIWA TYLERI (DECAPOD), GIGANTOPELTA CHESSOIA (PELTOSPIRID GASTROPOD) AND VULCANOLEPAS SCOTIAENSIS (STALKED BARNACLE) COLLECTED FROM 3 HYDROTHERMAL VENT FIELD SITES (E2, E9N AND E9S) ON THE EAST SCOTIA RIDGE (ESR), SOUTHERN OCEAN. SEAB ONLY REVEALED SPATIAL DIFFERENCES IN ISOTOPIC NICHE AREA IN MALE K. TYLERI. HOWEVER, THE PARAMETERS USED TO DRAW THE SEAC, ECCENTRICITY (E) AND ANGLE OF THE MAJOR SEAC AXIS TO THE X-AXIS (), INDICATED SPATIAL DIFFERENCES IN THE RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN 13C AND 15N IN ALL 3 SPECIES. THE GLS MODELS INDICATED THAT THERE WERE SPATIAL DIFFERENCES IN ISOTOPE.LENGTH TRENDS, WHICH WERE RELATED TO E AND OF THE SEAC. THIS INDICATED THAT E AND WERE POTENTIALLY DRIVEN BY UNDERLYING TROPHIC AND BIOLOGICAL PROCESSES THAT VARIED WITH BODY SIZE. EXAMINATION OF THE ISOTOPIC NICHES USING STANDARD ELLIPSE AREAS AND THEIR PARAMETERS IN CONJUNCTION WITH LENGTH-BASED ANALYSES PROVIDED A MEANS BY WHICH A PROPORTION OF THE ISOTOPIC VARIABILITY WITHIN EACH SPECIES COULD BE DESCRIBED. WE SUGGEST THAT THE PARAMETERS E AND OFFER ADDITIONAL ECOLOGICAL INSIGHT THAT HAS SO FAR BEEN OVERLOOKED IN ISOTOPIC NICHE STUDIES. 2016 INTER-RESEARCH."
