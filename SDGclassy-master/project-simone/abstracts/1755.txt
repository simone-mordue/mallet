"1504" "TO IDENTIFY THE SUSCEPTIBILITY OF LONG-HORNED GRASSHOPPERS TO ENTOMOPATHOGENIC FUNGI, THE EFFECT OF INFECTION WITH THE FUNGI BEAUVERIA BASSIANA (BALSAMO) VUILLEMIN (HYPOCREALES: CLAVICIPITACEAE) AND METARHIZIUM ANISOPLIAE (METCHNIKOFF) SOROKIN (HYPOCREALES: CLAVICIPITACEAE) ON FOOD CONSUMPTION BY UVAROVISTIA ZEBRA (UVAROV) (ORTHOPTERA: TETTIGONIIDAE) WAS INVESTIGATED. PRELIMINARY RESULTS SHOWED THAT BOTH FUNGI HAD A NEGATIVE EFFECT ON FOOD CONSUMPTION OF THE INSECTS. FOR BOTH FUNGI A SIGNIFICANT REDUCTION OF FOOD CONSUMPTION AND FAECES PRODUCTION BY INSECTS WERE OBSERVED BETWEEN THE HIGHEST SPORE CONCENTRATION (5106 SPORES/ML) AND OTHER TREATMENTS. COMPARED WITH CONTROL INSECTS, THE INSECTS TREATED WITH 5106 SPORES/ML OF B. BASSIANA AND M. ANISOPLIAE SHOWED 60 AND 63% REDUCTION IN MEAN FOOD CONSUMPTION/INSECT, RESPECTIVELY. THE CORRECTED CUMULATIVE PERCENT MORTALITY OF THE INSECTS TREATED WITH THE HIGHEST CONCENTRATION OF B. BASSIANA AND M. ANISOPLIAE WERE 57.7 AND 55.5%, RESPECTIVELY. THIS WAS THE FIRST ACCOUNT OF THESE ENTOMOPATHOGENIC FUNGI BEING USED AGAINST A SPECIES FROM THIS FAMILY, THEREFORE BASED ON THE RESULTS OBTAINED FROM THIS RESEARCH, IT COULD BE SAID THAT THE FUNGI HAVE PATHOGENICITY EFFECT ON U. ZEBRA AS A LONG-HORNED GRASSHOPPER. THE AUTHOR 2015. PUBLISHED BY OXFORD UNIVERSITY PRESS ON BEHALF OF THE ENTOMOLOGICAL SOCIETY OF AMERICA."
