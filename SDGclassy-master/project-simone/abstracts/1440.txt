"269" "THE HADAL ZONE (6000~ 11,000 M DEEP) ARGUABLY REPRESENTS THE LAST GREAT FRONTIER IN MARINE SCIENCE. ALTHOUGH SCIENTIFIC ENDEAVOUR IN THESE DEEPEST ECOSYSTEMS HAS BEEN SLOW RELATIVE TO OTHER MORE ACCESSIBLE ENVIRONMENTS, PROGRESS IS STEADILY BEING MADE, PARTICULARLY IN THE LAST 10 YEARS. THIS PAPER DETAILS THE LATEST DEVELOPMENTS IN TECHNOLOGY AND SAMPLING EFFORT AT FULL OCEAN DEPTH, SCIENTIFIC LITERATURE, REPRESENTATION IN INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCES AND SYMPOSIA, THE RECENT ACQUISITION OF LARGE ECOLOGICAL DATA SETS, CONSERVATION, THE POTENTIAL FOR BIODISCOVERY AND DESCRIBES SOME KEY STRATEGIC SAMPLING APPROACHES TO ENSURE RECENT PROGRESS IS SUSTAINED EFFECTIVELY. THE TIMING OF THIS ARTICLE IS INDEED TO REFLECT ON RECENT SAMPLING EFFORTS AND RESULTING PUBLICATIONS TO PROVIDE PERSPECTIVES ON WHERE THE SCIENTIFIC COMMUNITY IS WITH REGARDS TO HADAL SCIENCE AND WHERE IT MIGHT LEAD IN THE IMMEDIATE FUTURE. 2018 ELSEVIER LTD" "A CONTEMPORARY PERSPECTIVE ON HADAL SCIENCE" "DEEP-SEA TECHNOLOGY; FULL OCEAN DEPTH; HADAL ZONE; MARIANA TRENCH; OCEAN TRENCHES"
