"1354" "THE APPLICATION OF LOCAL CONTROL THEORY COMBINED WITH NONADIABATIC AB INITIO MOLECULAR DYNAMICS TO STUDY THE PHOTOINDUCED INTRAMOLECULAR PROTON TRANSFER REACTION IN 4-HYDROXYACRIDINE WAS INVESTIGATED. ALL CALCULATIONS WERE PERFORMED WITHIN THE FRAMEWORK OF LINEAR-RESPONSE TIME-DEPENDENT DENSITY FUNCTIONAL THEORY. THE COMPUTED PULSES REVEALED IMPORTANT INFORMATION ABOUT THE UNDERLYING EXCITED-STATE NUCLEAR DYNAMICS HIGHLIGHTING THE INVOLVEMENT OF COLLECTIVE VIBRATIONAL MODES THAT WOULD NORMALLY BE NEGLECTED IN A STUDY PERFORMED ON MODEL SYSTEMS CONSTRAINED TO A SUBSET OF THE FULL CONFIGURATION SPACE. THIS STUDY EMPHASIZES THE STRENGTHS OF LOCAL CONTROL THEORY FOR THE DESIGN OF PULSES THAT CAN TRIGGER CHEMICAL REACTIONS ASSOCIATED WITH THE POPULATION OF A GIVEN MOLECULAR EXCITED STATE. IN ADDITION, ANALYSIS OF THE GENERATED PULSES CAN HELP TO SHED NEW LIGHT ON THE PHOTOPHYSICS AND PHOTOCHEMISTRY OF COMPLEX MOLECULAR SYSTEMS. 2015 WILEY-VCH VERLAG GMBH & CO. KGAA, WEINHEIM."
