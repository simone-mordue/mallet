"1792" "PERFORMANCE OF PIGS FROM BIRTH TO SLAUGHTER IS A RESULT OF A COMPLEX INTERACTION OF FACTORS, WITH THE EARLY STAGES OF A PIG'S LIFE LIKELY TO AFFECT LIFETIME PERFORMANCE. DURING THE PREWEANING STAGE, PIGLETS ARE RELIANT ON THE SOW FOR NUTRITION, AND SIBLING COMPETITION IS LIKELY TO AFFECT GROWTH, IN PARTICULAR FOR LOW BIRTH WEIGHT (LBIW) PIGLETS. THE OBJECTIVE OF THE EXPERIMENT WAS TO DETERMINE THE EFFECT OF LITTER COMPOSITION (LITTERMATE WEIGHT) AND MILK SUPPLEMENTATION DURING LACTATION ON THE PERFORMANCE OF LBIW PIGS TO WEANING AND THE LONG-TERM CONSEQUENCES OF TREATMENT TO SLAUGHTER. THE EXPERIMENT WAS A 2 2 FACTORIAL WITH LITTERMATE WEIGHT (NORMAL OR LBIW) AND PROVISION OF SUPPLEMENTARY MILK FROM D 1 TO 28 (YES OR NO) AS FACTORS. A TOTAL OF 265 PIGLETS WERE SELECTED WITHIN 24 H OF BIRTH AND CROSS-FOSTERED TO CREATE 2 LITTER TYPES (LOW=LBIW PIGS [1.25 KG] ONLY AND MX=BOTH LBIW AND NORMAL BIRTH WEIGHT PIGS [1.6 TO 2.0 KG]), HALF OF THE LITTERS WITHIN A TYPE WERE SUPPLEMENTED WITH MILK AND THE OTHER HALF WERE NOT. THE BEHAVIOR OF LITTERS GIVEN MILK WAS RECORDED TO IDENTIFY MILK CONSUMPTION PATTERNS. PIGLETS WERE WEANED AT D 28 AND KEPT IN THEIR LITTERS UNTIL D 70 AND THEN SUBSEQUENTLY HOUSED IN MIXED GROUPS UNTIL SLAUGHTER. NO DIFFERENCE WAS OBSERVED AT ANY STAGE IN THE ADG OF PIGS GIVEN ACCESS TO SUPPLEMENTARY MILK OR NOT (P > 0.05) NOR WAS THERE ANY SIGNIFICANT INTERACTION BETWEEN MILK PROVISION AND LITTER COMPOSITION (P > 0.05). HOWEVER, LOW LITTERS DRANK SIGNIFICANTLY MORE SUPPLEMENTARY MILK THAN MX LITTERS (P < 0.001). THERE WAS A SIGNIFICANT EFFECT OF LITTER TYPE ON ADG FROM D 14 TO 28, WITH LBIW PIGS IN LOW LITTERS PERFORMING BETTER THAN THOSE IN MX LITTERS (0.252 VERSUS 0.217 KG/D, P < 0.05). AT WEANING, LBIW PIGLETS IN LOW LITTERS WEIGHED OVER 500 G MORE THAN THOSE IN MX LITTERS (P < 0.05). IN MX LITTERS THERE WAS A SIGNIFICANT INTERACTION BETWEEN BIRTH WEIGHT AND SUPPLEMENTARY MILK ON THE CV OF BW FROM D 14 TO SLAUGHTER (P < 0.05). IN CONCLUSION, GROUPING LBIW PIGLETS WITH SIMILAR SIZED LITTERMATES PREWEANING CAN IMPROVE PREWEANING PERFORMANCE BY REDUCING COMPETITION FROM HEAVIER LITTERMATES, HOWEVER, THIS ADVANTAGE DOES NOT PERSIST AFTER WEANING. ALTHOUGH SUPPLEMENTARY MILK DOES NOT IMPROVE LBIW PIG PERFORMANCE BEFORE OR AFTER WEANING, IT AFFECTS THEIR DRINKING BEHAVIOR AND CAN REDUCE THE VARIATION IN THE BW OF LBIW PIGLETS IN MIXED LITTERS TO SLAUGHTER. 2014 AMERICAN SOCIETY OF ANIMAL SCIENCE.
