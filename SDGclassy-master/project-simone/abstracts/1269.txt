"1278" "TAPER WEAR AT THE HEAD-NECK JUNCTION IS A POSSIBLE CAUSE OF EARLY FAILURE IN LARGE HEAD METAL-ON-METAL (LH-MOM) HIP REPLACEMENTS. WE HYPOTHESIZED THAT: (I) TAPER WEAR MAY BE MORE PRONOUNCED IN CERTAIN PRODUCT DESIGNS, AND (II) AN INCREASED ABDUCTOR MOMENT ARM MAY BE PROTECTIVE. THE TAPERS OF 104 EXPLANTED LH-MOM HIP REPLACEMENTS REVISED FOR ADVERSE REACTION TO METAL DEBRIS (ARMD) FROM A SINGLE MANUFACTURER WERE ANALYZED FOR LINEAR AND VOLUMETRIC WEAR USING A CO-ORDINATE MEASURING MACHINE. THE MATED STEM WAS A SHORTER 12/14, THREADED TRUNNION (N=72) OR A LONGER, SMOOTH 11/13 TRUNNION (N=32). THE ABDUCTOR MOMENT ARM WAS CALCULATED FROM PRE-REVISION RADIOGRAPHS. INDEPENDENT PREDICTORS OF LINEAR AND VOLUMETRIC WEAR INCLUDED TAPER ANGLE, STEM TYPE, AND THE HORIZONTAL MOMENT ARM. TAPERS MATED WITH THE THREADED 12/14 TRUNNION HAD SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER RATES OF VOLUMETRIC WEAR (0.402 MM3/YR VS. 0.123 MM3/YR [T=-2.145, P=0.035]). THERE WAS A TREND TO LARGER ABDUCTOR MOMENT ARMS BEING PROTECTIVE (P=0.055). DESIGN VARIATION APPEARS TO PLAY AN IMPORTANT ROLE IN TAPER-TRUNNION JUNCTION FAILURE. WE RECOMMEND THAT SURGEONS BEAR THESE FINDINGS IN MIND WHEN CONSIDERING THE USE OF A SHORT, THREADED TRUNNION WITH A COBALT-CHROMIUM HEAD. 2015 ORTHOPAEDIC RESEARCH SOCIETY.
