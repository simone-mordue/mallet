"938" "FACIAL EXPRESSIONS ARE ROUTINELY USED TO ASSESS PAIN IN HUMANS, PARTICULARLY THOSE WHO ARE NON-VERBAL. RECENTLY, THERE HAS BEEN AN INTEREST IN DEVELOPING CODING SYSTEMS FOR FACIAL GRIMACING IN NON-HUMAN ANIMALS, SUCH AS RODENTS, RABBITS, HORSES AND SHEEP. THE AIMS OF THIS PRELIMINARY STUDY WERE TO: 1. QUALITATIVELY IDENTIFY FACIAL FEATURE CHANGES IN LAMBS EXPERIENCING PAIN AS A RESULT OF TAIL-DOCKING AND COMPILE THESE CHANGES TO CREATE A LAMB GRIMACE SCALE (LGS), 2. DETERMINE WHETHER HUMAN OBSERVERS CAN USE THE LGS TO DIFFERENTIATE TAIL-DOCKED LAMBS FROM CONTROL LAMBS AND DIFFERENTIATE LAMBS BEFORE AND AFTER DOCKING, 3. DETERMINE WHETHER CHANGES IN FACIAL ACTION UNITS OF THE LGS CAN BE OBJECTIVELY QUANTIFIED IN LAMBS BEFORE AND AFTER DOCKING, 4. EVALUATE EFFECTS OF RESTRAINT OF LAMBS ON OBSERVERS PERCEPTIONS OF PAIN USING THE LGS AND ON QUANTITATIVE MEASURES OF FACIAL ACTION UNITS. BY COMPARING IMAGES OF LAMBS BEFORE (NO PAIN) AND AFTER (PAIN) TAIL-DOCKING, THE LGS WAS DEVISED IN CONSULTATION WITH SCIENTISTS EXPERIENCED IN ASSESSING FACIAL EXPRESSION IN OTHER SPECIES. THE LGS CONSISTS OF FIVE FACIAL ACTION UNITS: ORBITAL TIGHTENING, MOUTH FEATURES, NOSE FEATURES, CHEEK FLATTENING AND EAR POSTURE. THE AIMS OF THE STUDY WERE ADDRESSED IN TWO EXPERIMENTS. IN EXPERIMENT I, STILL IMAGES OF THE FACES OF RESTRAINED LAMBS WERE TAKEN FROM VIDEO FOOTAGE BEFORE AND AFTER TAIL-DOCKING (N=4) OR SHAM TAIL-DOCKING (N=3). THESE IMAGES WERE SCORED BY A GROUP OF FIVE NAVE HUMAN OBSERVERS USING THE LGS. BECAUSE LAMBS WERE RESTRAINED FOR THE DURATION OF THE EXPERIMENT, EAR POSTURE WAS NOT SCORED. THE SCORES FOR THE IMAGES WERE AVERAGED TO PROVIDE ONE VALUE PER FEATURE PER PERIOD AND THEN SCORES FOR THE FOUR LGS ACTION UNITS WERE AVERAGED TO GIVE ONE LGS SCORE PER LAMB PER PERIOD. IN EXPERIMENT II, STILL IMAGES OF THE FACES NINE LAMBS WERE TAKEN BEFORE AND AFTER TAIL-DOCKING. STILLS WERE TAKEN WHEN LAMBS WERE RESTRAINED AND UNRESTRAINED IN EACH PERIOD. A DIFFERENT GROUP OF FIVE HUMAN OBSERVERS SCORED THE IMAGES FROM EXPERIMENT II. CHANGES IN FACIAL ACTION UNITS WERE ALSO QUANTIFIED OBJECTIVELY BY A RESEARCHER USING IMAGE MEASUREMENT SOFTWARE. IN BOTH EXPERIMENTS LGS SCORES WERE ANALYZED USING A LINEAR MIXED MODEL TO EVALUATE THE EFFECTS OF TAIL DOCKING ON OBSERVERS PERCEPTION OF FACIAL EXPRESSION CHANGES. KENDALL'S INDEX OF CONCORDANCE WAS USED TO MEASURE RELIABILITY AMONG OBSERVERS. IN EXPERIMENT I, HUMAN OBSERVERS WERE ABLE TO USE THE LGS TO DIFFERENTIATE DOCKED LAMBS FROM CONTROL LAMBS. LGS SCORES SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASED FROM BEFORE TO AFTER TREATMENT IN DOCKED LAMBS BUT NOT CONTROL LAMBS. IN EXPERIMENT II THERE WAS A SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN LGS SCORES AFTER DOCKING. THIS WAS COUPLED WITH CHANGES IN OTHER VALIDATED INDICATORS OF PAIN AFTER DOCKING IN THE FORM OF PAIN-RELATED BEHAVIOUR. ONLY TWO COMPONENTS, MOUTH FEATURES AND ORBITAL TIGHTENING, SHOWED SIGNIFICANT QUANTITATIVE CHANGES AFTER DOCKING. THE DIRECTION OF THESE CHANGES AGREE WITH THE DESCRIPTION OF THESE FACIAL ACTION UNITS IN THE LGS. RESTRAINT AFFECTED PEOPLE'S PERCEPTIONS OF PAIN AS WELL AS QUANTITATIVE MEASURES OF LGS COMPONENTS. FREELY MOVING LAMBS WERE SCORED LOWER USING THE LGS OVER BOTH PERIODS AND HAD A SIGNIFICANTLY SMALLER EYE APERTURE AND SMALLER NOSE AND EAR ANGLES THAN WHEN THEY WERE HELD. AGREEMENT AMONG OBSERVERS FOR LGS SCORES WERE FAIR OVERALL (EXPERIMENT I: W=0.60, EXPERIMENT II: W=0.66). THIS PRELIMINARY STUDY DEMONSTRATES CHANGES IN LAMB FACIAL EXPRESSION ASSOCIATED WITH PAIN. THE RESULTS OF THESE EXPERIMENTS SHOULD BE INTERPRETED WITH CAUTION DUE TO LOW LAMB NUMBERS. 2016 ELSEVIER B.V."
