"1851" "METHODS FOR OBSERVING THE ROTATIONAL SPECTRA OF THE HALOGEN-BONDED COMPLEXES BICL AND BICF3 (B=N2, CO, HCCH, H2C=CH2, H2O, H2S, PH3 OR NH3) AND DERIVING FROM THEM PROPERTIES SUCH AS ANGULAR GEOMETRY, RADIAL GEOMETRY, THE STRENGTH OF THE INTERMOLECULAR BOND, AND THE EXTENT OF ELECTRON REDISTRIBUTION ON COMPLEX FORMATION ARE DESCRIBED. COMPARISON OF VARIOUS PROPERTIES REVEALS SEVERAL SIMILARITIES BETWEEN THE TWO SERIES. THUS, THE BICF3 OBEY A SET OF RULES WHICH WERE ORIGINALLY PROPOSED TO RATIONALISE THE ANGULAR GEOMETRIES OF HYDROGEN-BONDED COMPLEXES OF THE TYPE BHX, BUT WHICH WERE SUBSEQUENTLY FOUND TO APPLY TO THEIR HALOGEN-BONDED ANALOGUES BXY, WHERE XY IS A DIHALOGEN MOLECULE, INCLUDING ICL. IMPORTANT FOR ESTABLISHING THE VALIDITY OF THESE RULES IN BOTH SERIES BICL AND BICF3 WERE THE COMPLEXES WITH B=H2O OR H2S. THE CONFIGURATION AT O IN H2OICF3 AND H2OICL IS EFFECTIVELY PLANAR. ON THE OTHER HAND, THE CONFIGURATION AT S IN H2SICF3 AND H2SICL IS PERMANENTLY PYRAMIDAL. AB INITIO CALCULATIONS OF POTENTIAL ENERGY FUNCTIONS FOR INVERSION AT O OR S PERFORMED AT THE CCSD(T)(F12*)/ CC-PVDZ-F12 LEVEL OF THEORY CONFIRMED THESE CONCLUSIONS. COMPARISON OF THE INTERMOLECULAR STRETCHING FORCE CONSTANTS K SHOW THAT THE SERIES BICF3 IS SYSTEMATICALLY MORE WEAKLY BOUND THAN BICL. INTERPRETATION OF K IN TERMS OF NUCLEOPHILICITIES NB OF B AND ELECTROPHILICITIES EIR OF ICL AND ICF3 REVEALS THAT EICF3 EICL=3. EXPERIMENTAL AND AB INITIO VALUES OF DISTANCES R(ZI), WHERE Z IS THE ACCEPTOR ATOM/ REGION OF B, SHOW THAT, FOR A GIVEN B, THE INTERMOLECULAR BOND OF BICF3 IS LONGER THAN THAT OF BICL. THE ELECTRONIC CHARGE REDISTRIBUTED FROM B TO ICF3 ON FORMATION OF BICF3 IS PROBABLY NEGLIGIBLY SMALL. SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING SWITZERLAND 2014."
