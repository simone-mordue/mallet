"481" "THE ABILITY OF CANCER CELLS TO REPAIR DNA DAMAGE IS AN IMPORTANT DETERMINANT OF THEIR SUSCEPTIBILITY TO DNA-DAMAGING ANTICANCER THERAPIES, AND INHIBITION OF DNA-REPAIR PROCESSES CAN THUS LEAD TO THE POTENTIAL THERAPEUTIC ENDPOINTS OF RADIO- AND CHEMO-SENSITISATION. AS SUCH, A NUMBER OF AGENTS THAT TARGET DNA-REPAIR ENZYMES ARE CURRENTLY THE SUBJECT OF CLINICAL TRIALS. THE PHOSPHATIDYLINOSITOL 3-KINASE RELATED KINASE (PIKK) FAMILY OF ENZYMES, WHICH INCLUDES DNA-DEPENDENT PROTEIN KINASE (DNA-PK), ATAXIA-TELANGIECTASIA MUTATED (ATM), ATAXIA-TELANGIECTASIA MUTATED RELATED (ATR), MAMMALIAN TARGET OF RAPAMYCIN (MTOR) AND HSMG1, ARE THOUGHT TO ACT AS NUCLEIC ACID SURVEILLANCE PROTEINS. DNA-PK AND ATM, THE NORMAL FUNCTION OF WHICH IS LOST IN ATAXIA-TELANGIECTASIA, BOTH PLAY AN IMPORTANT ROLE IN THE DETECTION AND REPAIR OF DNA DOUBLE-STRAND BREAKS (DSBS). DNA-PK IS AN ESSENTIAL COMPONENT OF THE NON-HOMOLOGOUS END-JOINING (NHEJ) PATHWAY OF DNA DSB REPAIR, WHILST ATM SIGNALS TO CELL CYCLE AND DNA-REPAIR COMPONENTS BY PHOSPHORYLATING MULTIPLE DOWNSTREAM TARGETS, INCLUDING P53, CHECKPOINT KINASE 2 (CHK2), NBS1 AND BRCA1. CRUCIALLY, LOSS OF DNA-PK OR ATM ACTIVITY RESULTS IN AN INCREASED SENSITIVITY TO IONISING RADIATION AND CERTAIN CHEMOTHERAPEUTIC AGENTS THAT ELICIT DNA DSBS. THESE KINASES THEREFORE REPRESENT ATTRACTIVE TARGETS FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF RADIO- AND CHEMO-SENSITISING AGENTS. SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG 2017."
