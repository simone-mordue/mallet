"1322" "A STREPTOMYCES STRAIN ISOLATED FROM A MANGROVE SEDIMENT WAS CLASSIFIED USING A POLYPHASIC APPROACH. THE ORGANISM, ISOLATE GY1T, WAS FOUND TO HAVE CHEMICAL AND MORPHOLOGICAL PROPERTIES TYPICAL OF MEMBERS OF THE GENUS STREPTOMYCES. THE ISOLATE WAS SHOWN TO FORM A DISTINCT PHYLETIC LINE WITHIN THE STREPTOMYCESRADIOPUGNANS 16S RRNA GENE SUBCLADE AND TO BE CLOSELY RELATED TO THE TYPE STRAIN OF STREPTOMYCESFENHUANGENSIS (98.7% SIMILARITY). IT IS ALSO CLOSELY RELATED TO THE TYPE STRAIN OF STREPTOMYCES BAKULENSIS WHICH WAS ALSO CLOSELY RELATED TO MEMBERS OF THE STREPTOMYCES GLAUCOSPORUS 16S RRNA GENE SUBCLADE. ISOLATE GY1T WAS DISTINGUISHED READILY FROM THE S. BARKULENSIS TYPE STRAIN AND FROM SPECIES CLASSIFIED IN THE S. RADIOPUGNANS CLADE USING A COMBINATION OF MORPHOLOGICAL AND PHYSIOLOGICAL PROPERTIES, INCLUDING A REQUIREMENT FOR SEAWATER FOR GROWTH. BASED ON THE GENOTYPIC AND PHENOTYPIC DATA, IT IS PROPOSED THAT ISOLATE GY1T (=NCIMB 14980T, NRRL B-69296T) BE CLASSIFIED IN THE GENUS STREPTOMYCES AS STREPTOMYCESMANGROVI SP.
