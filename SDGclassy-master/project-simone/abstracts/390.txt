"166" "COCCIDIAL INFECTIONS MAY REDUCE FAT SOLUBLE VITAMIN STATUS AND BONE MINERALISATION IN BROILER CHICKENS. WE HYPOTHESISED THAT BROILERS INFECTED WITH EIMERIA MAXIMA WOULD BENEFIT FROM INCREASED DIETARY SUPPLEMENTATION WITH VITAMIN D (VITD) OR WITH 25-OH-D3 (25D3). MALE ROSS 308 CHICKENS WERE ASSIGNED TO DIETS WITH LOW (L) OR COMMERCIAL (M) VITD LEVELS (1000 VS 4000 IU/KG) SUPPLEMENTED AS D3 OR 25D3. AT D11 OF AGE BIRDS WERE INOCULATED WITH WATER (C) OR 7000 E. MAXIMA OOCYSTS (I). PEN PERFORMANCE WAS CALCULATED OVER THE EARLY (D1 - 6), ACUTE (D7 - 10) AND RECOVERY PERIODS (D11 - 14) POST-INFECTION (PI). AT THE END OF EACH PERIOD 6 BIRDS PER TREATMENT WERE DISSECTED TO ASSESS LONG BONE MINERALISATION, PLASMA LEVELS OF 25D3, CALCIUM AND PHOSPHORUS, AND INTESTINAL HISTOMORPHOMETRY. PARASITE REPLICATION AND TRANSCRIPTION OF CYTOKINES IL-10 AND IFN-WERE ASSESSED AT D6 PI USING QUANTITATIVE PCR. PERFORMANCE, BONE MINERALISATION AND PLASMA 25D3 LEVELS WERE SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCED DURING INFECTION (P &LT, 0.05). M DIETS OR DIETS WITH 25D3 RAISED PLASMA 25D3, IMPROVED PERFORMANCE AND ASPECTS OF MINERALISATION (P &LT, 0.05). OFFERING L DIETS COMPROMISED FEED EFFICIENCY PI, REDUCED FEMUR BREAKING STRENGTH AND PLASMA PHOSPHOROUS LEVELS AT D10 PI IN I BIRDS (P &LT, 0.05). CONTRASTINGLY, OFFERING M DIETS OR DIETS WITH 25D3 RESULTED IN HIGHER PARASITE LOADS (P &LT, 0.001) AND REDUCED JEJUNAL VILLI LENGTH AT D10 PI (P &LT, 0.01), WITH NO EFFECT ON IL-10 OR IFN-TRANSCRIPTION. DIETS WITH 4000 IU/KG VITD CONTENT OR WITH 25D3 IMPROVED PERFORMANCE AND MINERALISATION, IRRESPECTIVE OF INFECTION STATUS, WHILST 4000 IU/KG LEVELS OF VITD FURTHER IMPROVED FEED EFFICIENCY AND MINERALISATION IN THE PRESENCE OF A COCCIDIAL INFECTION. 2019 THE AUTHOR(S)."
