"1833" "PEPTIDE NUCLEIC ACIDS (PNAS) ARE A CLASS OF ARTIFICIAL DNA/RNA ANALOGUES THAT HAVE UNIQUE PHYSICOCHEMICAL PROPERTIES, WHICH INCLUDE A HIGH CHEMICAL STABILITY, RESISTANCE TO NUCLEASES AND PROTEASES AND HIGHER MISMATCH SENSITIVITY THAN DNA. PNAS WERE INITIALLY ANTICIPATED TO BE USEFUL FOR APPLICATION IN ANTISENSE AND ANTIGENE THERAPIES, HOWEVER, THEIR POOR CELLULAR UPTAKE HAS LIMITED THEIR USE FOR SUCH PURPOSES IN THE \"REAL WORLD\". RECENTLY, IT HAS BEEN SHOWN THAT THE ADDITION OF METAL COMPLEXES TO THESE OLIGONUCLEOTIDE ANALOGUES COULD OPEN UP NEW AVENUES FOR THEIR UTILIZATION IN VARIOUS RESEARCH FIELDS. SUCH METALLO-CONSTRUCTS HAVE SHOWN GREAT PROMISE, FOR A DIVERSE RANGE OF APPLICATIONS, MOST NOTABLY IN THE BIOSENSING AREA. IN THIS CHAPTER, WE REPORT ON THE RECENT SYNTHETIC ADVANCES TOWARDS THE PREPARATION OF THESE \"(MULTI)-METALLIC PNAS\" ON THE SOLID PHASE. 2014 SPRINGER SCIENCE+BUSINESS MEDIA, NEW YORK."
