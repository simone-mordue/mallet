"324" "MULTIFACTORIAL APPROACHES CAN QUICKLY AND EFFICIENTLY MODEL COMPLEX, INTERACTING NATURAL OR ENGINEERED BIOLOGICAL SYSTEMS IN A WAY THAT TRADITIONAL ONE-FACTOR-AT-A-TIME EXPERIMENTATION CAN FAIL TO DO. WE APPLIED A DESIGN OF EXPERIMENTS (DOE) APPROACH TO MODEL ETHANOL BIOSYNTHESIS IN YEAST, WHICH IS WELL-UNDERSTOOD AND GENETICALLY TRACTABLE, YET COMPLEX. SIX ALCOHOL DEHYDROGENASE (ADH) ISOZYMES CATALYZE ETHANOL SYNTHESIS, DIFFERING IN THEIR TRANSCRIPTIONAL AND POST-TRANSLATIONAL REGULATION, SUBCELLULAR LOCALIZATION, AND ENZYME KINETICS. WE GENERATED A COMBINATORIAL LIBRARY OF ALL ADH GENE DELETIONS AND MEASURED THE IMPACT OF GENE DELETION(S) AND ENVIRONMENTAL CONTEXT ON ETHANOL PRODUCTION OF A SUBSET OF THIS LIBRARY. THE DATA WERE USED TO BUILD A STATISTICAL MODEL THAT DESCRIBED KNOWN BEHAVIORS OF ADH ISOZYMES AND IDENTIFIED NOVEL INTERACTIONS. IMPORTANTLY, THE MODEL DESCRIBED FEATURES OF ADH METABOLIC BEHAVIOR WITHOUT EXPLICIT A PRIORI KNOWLEDGE. THE METHOD IS THEREFORE HIGHLY SUITED TO UNDERSTANDING AND OPTIMIZING METABOLIC PATHWAYS IN LESS WELL-UNDERSTOOD SYSTEMS. 2018 AMERICAN CHEMICAL SOCIETY."
