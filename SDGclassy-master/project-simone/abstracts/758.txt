"805" "INTRODUCTION: STUDIES COMPARING IQ IN OFFSPRING OF BIPOLAR PARENTS (OBP) WITH OFFSPRING OF HEALTHY CONTROLS (OHC) HAVE REPORTED CONFLICTING FINDINGS. THEY HAVE INCLUDED OBP WITH MENTAL HEALTH/NEURODEVELOPMENTAL DISORDERS AND/OR PHARMACOLOGICAL TREATMENT WHICH COULD AFFECT RESULTS. THIS UK STUDY AIMED TO ASSESS IQ IN OBP WITH NO MENTAL HEALTH/NEURODEVELOPMENTAL DISORDER AND ASSESS THE RELATIONSHIP OF SOCIODEMOGRAPHIC VARIABLES WITH IQ. METHODS: IQ DATA USING THE WECHSLER ABBREVIATED SCALE OF INTELLIGENCE (WASI) FROM 24 OBP AND 34 OHC FROM THE NORTH EAST OF ENGLAND WAS ANALYSED USING MIXED-EFFECTS MODELLING. RESULTS: ALL PARTICIPANTS HAD IQ IN THE AVERAGE RANGE. OBP DIFFERED STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANTLY FROM OHC ON FULL SCALE IQ (P =.001), PERFORMANCE IQ (PIQ) (P =.003) AND VERBAL IQ (VIQ) (P =.001) BUT NOT ON THE PIQ-VIQ SPLIT. OBP AND OHC GROUPS DID NOT DIFFER ON SOCIO-ECONOMIC STATUS (SES) AND GENDER. SES MADE A STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT CONTRIBUTION TO THE VARIANCE OF IQ SCORES (P =.001). CONCLUSIONS: USING A ROBUST STATISTICAL MODEL OF ANALYSIS, THE OBP WITH NO CURRENT/PAST HISTORY OF MENTAL HEALTH/NEURODEVELOPMENTAL DISORDERS HAD LOWER IQ SCORES COMPARED TO OHC. THIS FINDING SHOULD BE BORNE IN MIND WHEN ASSESSING AND RECOMMENDING INTERVENTIONS FOR OBP. 2016 INFORMA UK LIMITED, TRADING AS TAYLOR & FRANCIS GROUP."
