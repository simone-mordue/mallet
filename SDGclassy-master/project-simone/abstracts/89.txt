"692" "A POLYPHASIC STUDY WAS UNDERTAKEN TO ESTABLISH THE TAXONOMIC STATUS OF AN ACTINOMADURA STRAIN ISOLATED FROM THE MARGIN OF A SALINE, ALKALINE LAKE IN CENTRAL ANATOLIA, TURKEY. STRAIN D310ATT WAS SHOWN TO HAVE CHEMOTAXONOMIC, CULTURAL AND MORPHOLOGICAL PROPERTIES CONSISTENT WITH ITS CLASSIFICATION IN THE GENUS ACTINOMADURA SUCH AS HOOKED OR IRREGULAR SPIRAL SPORE CHAINS, MESO-DIAMINOPIMELIC ACID AS THE MAJOR CELL WALL DIAMINOPIMELIC ACID, AND DIPHOSPHATIDYLGLYCEROL AND PHOSPHATIDYLINOSITOL AS MAJOR POLAR LIPIDS. PHYLOGENETIC ANALYSES BASED ON 16S RRNA GENE SEQUENCES SHOWED THAT STRAIN D310ATT IS CLOSELY, ALBEIT LOOSELY, ASSOCIATED WITH ACTINOMADURA DARANGSHIENSIS DLS-70T WITH 97.2% SEQUENCE SIMILARITY, BUT WAS READILY SEPARATED FROM THE LATTER USING DIVERSE PHENOTYPIC PROPERTIES. CONSEQUENTLY, THE ISOLATE IS CONSIDERED TO REPRESENT A NEW SPECIES OF ACTINOMADURA FOR WHICH THE NAME ACTINOMADURA ALKALITERRAE SP. NOV. IS PROPOSED, WITH THE TYPE STRAIN D310ATT (=DSM 101185T=KCTC 39657T). 2017, SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING SWITZERLAND." "ACTINOMADURA ALKALITERRAE SP.
