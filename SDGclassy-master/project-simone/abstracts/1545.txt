"255" "THE REACTION OF [(DIPPNACNAC)MG(TMP)] (1) WITH 4-SUBTITUTED PYRIDINES PROCEEDS VIA SEQUENTIAL REGIOSELECTIVE METALLATION AND 1,2-ADDITION TO FURNISH A RANGE OF SYMMETRIC 4,4-R2-2,2-BIPYRIDINES IN GOOD YIELD, REPRESENTING A NEW ENTRY INTO BIPYRIDINE SYNTHESIS. INTERESTINGLY, THE REACTION OF 1 WITH 2-OME-PYRIDINE LED TO FORMATION OF ASYMMETRIC BIPYRIDINE 6, RESULTING FROM THE C6-MAGNESIATION OF THE HETEROCYCLE FOLLOWED BY A CC COUPLING STEP BY ADDITION TO THE C2 POSITION OF A SECOND, NON-METALLATED MOLECULE, AND SUBSEQUENT ELIMINATION OF [DIPPNACNACMGOME]2 (7). SYNTHESIS COMBINED WITH SPECTROSCOPIC AND STRUCTURAL ANALYSIS HELP RATIONALISE THE UNDERLYING PROCESSES RESULTING IN THE OBSERVED REACTIVITY, AND ELUCIDATE THE KEY ROLE THAT THE STERICALLY ENCUMBERED -DIKETIMINATE LIGAND PLAYS IN DETERMINING REGIOSELECTIVITY. 2018 WILEY-VCH VERLAG GMBH & CO.
