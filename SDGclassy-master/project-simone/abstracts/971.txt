TRAPPING OF SEVERAL FERRATED INTERMEDIATES HAS PROVIDED KEY INSIGHT INTO HOW SYNCHRONISED NA/FE COOPERATION OPERATES IN THESE TRANSFORMATIONS. FURTHERMORE, USING EXCESS 1 AT 80 C SWITCHES ON A REMARKABLE CASCADE PROCESS INDUCING THE COLLECTIVE TWOFOLD CH/THREEFOLD CF BOND ACTIVATIONS, WHERE EACH CH BOND IS TRANSFORMED TO A CFE BOND WHEREAS EACH CF BOND IS TRANSFORMED INTO A CN BOND. 2018 WILEY-VCH VERLAG GMBH & CO.
