"219" "NEGATIVITY TOWARDS ETHNIC MINORITIES IS A SERIOUS PROBLEM IN NORTHERN IRELAND. ITS HISTORY OF THE TROUBLES AROUND RELIGIOUS IDENTITIES MAKES NORTHERN IRELAND A SPECIAL CASE IN EUROPE. THIS PAPER EXAMINES NEGATIVITY TOWARDS MUSLIMS, EASTERN EUROPEANS AND IMMIGRANTS IN NORTHERN IRELAND USING DATA FROM THE NORTHERN IRELAND LIFE AND TIMES SURVEY AND THE BRITISH SOCIAL ATTITUDES SURVEY. THE RESULTS FROM REGRESSIONS SHOW THAT ANTI-IMMIGRANT NEGATIVITY IS NO MORE PREVALENT IN NORTHERN IRELAND THAN ELSEWHERE IN THE UK. HOWEVER, LEVELS OF NEGATIVITY TOWARDS MUSLIMS AND EASTERN EUROPEANS ARE SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER THAN IN GREAT BRITAIN AND HAVE INCREASED IN RECENT YEARS, PARTICULARLY AMONG YOUNG ADULTS AGED 1824 YEARS, ALTHOUGH OLDER COHORTS ARE MORE INTOLERANT ON AVERAGE. OUR REGRESSION ANALYSES FOUND STRONG POSITIVE RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN ANTI-IMMIGRANT NEGATIVITY, SECTARIANISM AND PERCEIVED NEIGHBOURHOOD SEGREGATION. HIGHER EDUCATION, CONTACTS WITH MINORITY MEMBERS AND (RELIGIOUSLY) MIXED SCHOOLING ARE NEGATIVELY RELATED TO NEGATIVITY TOWARDS IMMIGRANTS. 2017, 2017 THE AUTHOR(S).
