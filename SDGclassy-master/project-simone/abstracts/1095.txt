"695" "PURPOSE: WHILST INADEQUATE GLYCAEMIC CONTROL IS ASSOCIATED WITH AN INCREASE IN PERIOPERATIVE COMPLICATIONS FOLLOWING TOTAL KNEE ARTHROPLASTY, THE IMPACT OF GLYCAEMIC CONTROL IN THIS AT-RISK PATIENT GROUP REMAINS ILL-DEFINED. IDENTIFICATION OF AT-RISK PATIENTS WOULD ALLOW TARGETED PRE-OPERATIVE GLYCAEMIC CONTROL INTERVENTION. METHODS: ONE HUNDRED CONSECUTIVE PATIENTS WITH A DIAGNOSIS OF DIABETES MELLITUS AND ONE HUNDRED AGE, SEX AND BMI MATCHED PATIENTS WITHOUT DIABETES UNDERGOING TOTAL KNEE ARTHROPLASTY IN A SINGLE INSTITUTION WERE ANALYSED BETWEEN 2008 AND 2013. INADEQUATE GLYCAEMIC CONTROL WAS DEFINED AS HAVING AN HBA1C OF GREATER THAN 64MMOL/MOL (8.0% NGSP) MEASURED WITHIN THE 3MONTHS BEFORE SURGERY. PATIENT DEMOGRAPHICS, DIABETES MANAGEMENT AND COMPLICATIONS OF DIABETES WERE RECORDED AND USED AS EXPLANATORY VARIABLES TO DELIVER A GENERALISED LINEAR MODEL. THIS ALLOWS FOR RELATIONSHIPS TO BE DEFINED BETWEEN CHANGE IN PATIENT-REPORTED FUNCTION (SF-36, WOMAC) AND THESE EXPLANATORY VARIABLES. RESULTS: THE PATIENT GROUP WITH CONCOMITANT DIABETES EXHIBITED SMALLER IMPROVEMENTS IN WOMAC AND SF-36 PHYSICAL COMPONENT SUMMARY AT 1YEAR AFTER KNEE ARTHROPLASTY. THIS EFFECT WAS MOST PRONOUNCED IN THE SUBSET OF PATIENTS WITH INADEQUATE GLYCAEMIC CONTROL RECORDED IN THE EARLY PRE-OPERATIVE PERIOD. CONCLUSION: PATIENTS WITH DIABETES, PARTICULARLY THOSE WITH INADEQUATE GLYCAEMIC CONTROL, EXHIBIT LESS IMPROVEMENT AT 1YEAR FOLLOWING KNEE ARTHROPLASTY THAN PATIENTS WITHOUT DIABETES MELLITUS. CLINICAL FOCUS ON MODULATING THIS FACTOR IN THIS AT-RISK GROUP IS WARRANTED. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: III. 2016, EUROPEAN SOCIETY OF SPORTS TRAUMATOLOGY, KNEE SURGERY, ARTHROSCOPY (ESSKA)." "INADEQUATE PRE-OPERATIVE GLYCAEMIC CONTROL IN PATIENTS WITH DIABETES MELLITUS ADVERSELY INFLUENCES FUNCTIONAL RECOVERY AFTER TOTAL KNEE ARTHROPLASTY: PATIENTS WITH IMPAIRED GLYCAEMIC CONTROL EXHIBIT POORER FUNCTIONAL OUTCOMES AT 1-YEAR POST-ARTHROPLASTY" "COMPLICATIONS; DIABETES MELLITUS; GLYCAEMIC CONTROL; TOTAL KNEE ARTHROPLASTY"
