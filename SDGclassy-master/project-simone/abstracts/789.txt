"1487" "LARGE-SCALE REARING OF CORAL LARVAE DURING MASS SPAWNING EVENTS AND SUBSEQUENT DIRECT INTRODUCTION OF COMPETENT LARVAE ONTO DENUDED REEFS ('LARVAL SEEDING') HAS BEEN PROPOSED AS A LOW-TECH AND AFFORDABLE WAY OF ENHANCING CORAL SETTLEMENT AND HENCE RECOVERY OF DEGRADED REEFS. WHILE SOME STUDIES HAVE SHOWN POSITIVE SHORT-TERM EFFECTS ON SETTLEMENT, TO DATE, NONE HAVE EXAMINED THE LONG-TERM EFFECTS OF LARVAL SEEDING FOR A BROADCAST-SPAWNING CORAL. HERE, WE TEST WHETHER LARVAL SEEDING SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASES CORAL RECRUITMENT RATES BOTH IN THE SHORT (5 WK) AND LONGER (6 MO TO 1 YR) TERM. LARVAE OF ACROPORA DIGITIFERA WERE REARED EX SITU, AND 1 MILLION LARVAE WERE INTRODUCED TO 7 ARTIFICIAL REEFS (ARS) WHILE 7 OTHERS WERE LEFT UNSEEDED. SETTLEMENT TILES DEPLOYED ON BOTH SEEDED AND CONTROL ARS WERE RETRIEVED FOR EXAMINATION 5 AND 30 WK AFTER SEEDING. IN ADDITION, THE PRESENCE OF VISIBLE CORAL RECRUITS ON THE AR SURFACES WAS MONITORED BEFORE AND FOR 13 MO POST-SEEDING. DENSITY OF ACROPORID SPAT WAS SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER ON SEEDED TILES THAN ON CONTROLS 5 WK AFTER SEEDING, BUT THIS EFFECT HAD VANISHED BY 30 WK. COMPARISON OF THE DENSITIES OF NEW VISIBLE ACROPORA RECRUITS BETWEEN SEEDED AND CONTROL ARS SHOWED NO SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE 13 MO AFTER SEEDING. LARVAL SEEDING THEREFORE HAD NO LONG-TERM EFFECT DUE TO HIGH POST-SETTLEMENT MORTALITY (WHICH APPEARED TO BE DENSITY-RELATED). RESULTS SUGGEST THAT REEF-REHABILITATION METHODS THAT AIM TO HARNESS CORAL SEXUAL REPRODUCTION MIGHT BETTER FOCUS ON REARING JUVENILES THROUGH EARLY POST-SETTLEMENT MORTALITY BOTTLENECKS.
