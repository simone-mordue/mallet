"1253" "CELL WALLS OF GRASSES, INCLUDING CEREAL CROPS AND BIOFUEL GRASSES, COMPRISE THE MAJORITY OF PLANT BIOMASS AND INTIMATELY INFLUENCE PLANT GROWTH, DEVELOPMENT AND PHYSIOLOGY. HOWEVER, THE FUNCTIONS OF MANY CELL WALL SYNTHESIS GENES, AND THE RELATIONSHIPS AMONG AND THE FUNCTIONS OF CELL WALL COMPONENTS REMAIN OBSCURE. TO BETTER UNDERSTAND THE PATTERNS OF CELL WALL ACCUMULATION AND IDENTIFY GENES THAT ACT IN GRASS CELL WALL BIOSYNTHESIS, WE CHARACTERIZED 30 SAMPLES FROM AERIAL ORGANS OF RICE (ORYZA SATIVA CV. KITAAKE) AT 10 DEVELOPMENTAL TIME POINTS, 3-100 D POST-GERMINATION. WITHIN THESE SAMPLES, WE MEASURED 15 CELL WALL CHEMICAL COMPONENTS, ENZYMATIC DIGESTIBILITY AND 18 CELL WALL POLYSACCHARIDE EPITOPES/LIGANDS. WE ALSO USED QUANTITATIVE REVERSE TRANSCRIPTION-PCR TO MEASURE EXPRESSION OF 50 GLYCOSYLTRANSFERASES, 15 ACYLTRANSFERASES AND EIGHT PHENYLPROPANOID GENES, MANY OF WHICH HAD PREVIOUSLY BEEN IDENTIFIED AS BEING HIGHLY EXPRESSED IN RICE. MOST CELL WALL COMPONENTS VARY SIGNIFICANTLY DURING DEVELOPMENT, AND CORRELATIONS AMONG THEM SUPPORT CURRENT UNDERSTANDING OF CELL WALLS. WE IDENTIFIED 92 SIGNIFICANT CORRELATIONS BETWEEN CELL WALL COMPONENTS AND GENE EXPRESSION AND ESTABLISH NINE STRONG HYPOTHESES FOR GENES THAT SYNTHESIZE XYLANS, MIXED LINKAGE GLUCAN AND PECTIN COMPONENTS. THIS WORK PROVIDES AN EXTENSIVE ANALYSIS OF CELL WALL COMPOSITION THROUGHOUT RICE DEVELOPMENT, IDENTIFIES GENES LIKELY TO SYNTHESIZE GRASS CELL WALLS, AND PROVIDES A FRAMEWORK FOR DEVELOPMENT OF GENETICALLY IMPROVED GRASSES FOR USE IN LIGNOCELLULOSIC BIOFUEL PRODUCTION AND AGRICULTURE.
