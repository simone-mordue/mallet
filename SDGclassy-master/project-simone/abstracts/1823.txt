"447" "VEGETATION SPECIES COMPOSITION AND STRUCTURE ARE KNOWN TO AFFECT TAXONOMIC COMPOSITION AND LIFE-HISTORY CHARACTERISTICS OF ARTHROPOD COMMUNITIES. SOIL CONDITIONS ALTER VEGETATION COMPOSITION AND STRUCTURE, AND THUS, SOILS HAVE INDIRECT EFFECTS ON ARTHROPODS. WHILST GRASSLAND MANAGEMENT AFFECTS SOIL PROPERTIES, AND HENCE VEGETATION, THE DIRECT EFFECTS OF SOIL ON ARTHROPOD COMMUNITIES WITHIN THE SWARD ARE LESS CLEAR. WE USED A LONG-TERM HAY MEADOW EXPERIMENT TO ASSESS BOTH DIRECT AND INDIRECT EFFECTS OF VARIOUS FERTILIZER REGIMES ON ARTHROPOD COMMUNITY COMPOSITION AND FEEDING GUILDS. ARTHROPODS WERE SAMPLED VIA PITFALL TRAPS AND SWEEP NETS AND THEN ANALYSED USING PRINCIPAL COMPONENTS AND REDUNDANCY ANALYSES (RDA) TO DETERMINE RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN SOIL PROPERTIES, VEGETATION COMMUNITY, FORAGE QUALITY AND ARTHROPOD COMMUNITY. VEGETATION COMMUNITY COMPOSITION, MEASURED BY THE FIRST VEGETATION PRINCIPAL COMPONENT, WAS USED AS A CONSTRAINING VARIABLE IN PARTIAL RDA, TO ESTIMATE DIRECT EFFECTS OF SOIL ON THE ARTHROPODS. VARIANCE PARTITIONING QUANTIFIED THE RELATIVE ROLES OF VEGETATION AND SOIL ON THE ARTHROPOD COMMUNITY. OUR RESULTS INDICATE THAT AVAILABLE SOIL NITROGEN AND CARBONNITROGEN RATIOS ARE IMPORTANT DETERMINANTS OF ARTHROPOD COMMUNITY COMPOSITION. ONCE THE EFFECTS OF THE VEGETATION WERE REMOVED, IT WAS FOUND THE SOIL ACIDITY AND THE AVAILABLE POTASSIUM ALTERED ARTHROPOD COMMUNITY COMPOSITION. FURTHER RESEARCH IS REQUIRED TO DETERMINE THE MECHANISMS BY WHICH THESE SOIL PROPERTIES AFFECT ARTHROPOD COMMUNITIES. 2017 BLACKWELL VERLAG GMBH" "LONG-TERM FERTILIZER REGIMES HAVE BOTH DIRECT AND INDIRECT EFFECTS ON ARTHROPOD COMMUNITY COMPOSITION AND FEEDING GUILDS" "ARTHROPODS; FEEDING GUILDS; GRASSLANDS; SOIL NUTRIENTS"
