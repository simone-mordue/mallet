"1937" "A PROMINENT FEATURE OF MANY HUMAN CANCERS IS ONCOGENE-DRIVEN ACTIVATION OF THE DNA DAMAGE RESPONSE (DDR) DURING EARLY TUMORIGENESIS. IT HAS BEEN SHOWN PREVIOUSLY THAT NONINVASIVE IMAGING OF THE PHOSPHORYLATED HISTONE H2A VARIANT H2AX, H2AX, A DNA DAMAGE SIGNALING PROTEIN, IS POSSIBLE USING 111IN-LABELED ANTI-H2AX ANTIBODY CONJUGATED TO THE CELL-PENETRATING PEPTIDE TRANSACTIVATOR OF TRANSCRIPTION (TAT). THE PURPOSE OF THIS STUDY WAS TO INVESTIGATE WHETHER 111IN-ANTI-H2AX-TAT DETECTS THE DDR DURING MAMMARY ONCOGENESIS IN BALB-NEUT MICE. METHODS: MAMMARY FAT PADS FROM BALB-NEUT AND WILD-TYPE MICE (AGE, 40-106 D) WERE IMMUNOSTAINED FOR H2AX. 111IN-ANTI-H2AX-TAT OR A CONTROL PROBE WAS ADMINISTERED INTRAVENOUSLY TO BALB-NEUT MICE. SPECT WAS PERFORMED WEEKLY AND COMPARED WITH TUMOR DETECTION USING PALPATION AND DYNAMIC CONTRAST-ENHANCED MR IMAGING. RESULTS: H2AX EXPRESSION WAS ELEVATED IN HYPERPLASTIC LESIONS IN THE MAMMARY FAT PADS OF BALB-NEUT MICE AGED 76-106 D, COMPARED WITH NORMAL FAT PADS FROM YOUNGER MICE AND CARCINOMAS FROM OLDER MICE (13.5 1.2 H2AX FOCI/CELL VS. 5.2 1.5 [P &LT, 0.05] AND 3.4 1.1 [P &LT, 0.001], RESPECTIVELY). SERIAL SPECT IMAGING REVEALED A 2.5-FOLD INCREASE IN 111IN-ANTI-H2AX-TAT ACCUMULATION IN THE MAMMARY FAT PADS OF MICE AGED 76-106 D, COMPARED WITH CONTROL PROBE (P=0.01). THE MEDIAN TIME TO DETECTION OF NEOPLASTIC LESIONS BY 111IN-ANTI-H2AX-TAT (DEFINED AS &GT,5% INJECTED DOSE PER GRAM OF TISSUE) WAS 96 D, COMPARED WITH 120 AND 131 D FOR DYNAMIC CONTRAST-ENHANCED MR IMAGING AND PALPATION, RESPECTIVELY (P &LT, 0.001). CONCLUSION: DDR IMAGING USING 111IN-ANTI-H2AX-TAT IDENTIFIED MAMMARY TUMORS SIGNIFICANTLY EARLIER THAN MR IMAGING. IMAGING THE DDR HOLDS PROMISE FOR THE DETECTION OF PRENEOPLASIA AND AS A TECHNIQUE FOR SCREENING CANCER-PRONE INDIVIDUALS.
