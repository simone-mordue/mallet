"291" "SHELL-BOUND ORGANIC MATTER (SBOM) IS PRESENT IN THE SHELLS OF BIOMINERALIZING ORGANISMS AND CAN ACT AS AN ISOTOPIC PROXY FOR NUTRITION. STABLE ISOTOPE ANALYSIS OF SBOM GENERALLY REQUIRES ITS ISOLATION FROM THE MINERAL COMPONENT OF THE SHELL, AND THIS STUDY SHOWS THAT VARIOUS SHELL REMOVAL TECHNIQUES (CATION EXCHANGE RESIN, ETHYLENEDIAMINETETRAACETIC ACID (EDTA), HYDROCHLORIC ACID (HCL), AND ACETIC ACID) CAN INFLUENCE THE CARBON (13C), NITROGEN (15N) AND SULFUR (34S) STABLE ISOTOPE VALUES OF BOTH TOTAL SBOM AND INTRA-CRYSTALLINE SBOM TO VARYING EXTENTS. IN ADDITION, ISOTOPIC AND COMPOSITIONAL DIFFERENCES ARE REPORTED HERE BETWEEN THE DIFFERENT SBOM POOLS IN THE SHELL: TOTAL SBOM AND INTRA-CRYSTALLINE SBOM. TOTAL SBOM ISOLATED FROM MYTILUS EDULIS, RUDITAPES DECUSSATUS AND CERASTODERMA EDULE SHOW MINOR DIFFERENCES IN 15N VALUES BETWEEN METHODS, BUT ALL TREATED SAMPLES HAVE SLIGHTLY HIGHER 15N VALUES WHEN COMPARED TO UNTREATED SHELL POWDER. METHODOLOGICAL DIFFERENCES FOR 15N VALUES OF INTRA-CRYSTALLINE SBOM ARE ALSO LIMITED TO ~1 WITH THE EXCEPTION OF CATION EXCHANGE RESIN (MAX. 4 COMPARED TO MEAN VALUES). USE OF THE CATION EXCHANGE TECHNIQUE IS ALSO DISCOURAGED FOR OBTAINING 13C AND 34S VALUES FOR TOTAL AND INTRA-CRYSTALLINE SBOM, DUE TO LARGE DEVIATIONS FROM MEAN VALUES (TO A MAXIMUM OF 2 AND 10 RESPECTIVELY). THE OTHER TESTED METHODS PRODUCE DATA WITH A 2-RANGE FOR 13C VALUES FOR TOTAL SBOM, ALTHOUGH FOR INTRA-CRYSTALLINE SBOM 13C VALUES THE USE OF ACETIC ACID PRODUCED NEGATIVE OUTLIERS. FOR SULFUR STABLE ISOTOPE ANALYSIS EXTRACTION BY EDTA IS RECOMMENDED, AS ACIDIFICATION METHODS PRODUCE 12 LOWER 34S VALUES FOR TOTAL SBOM, AND USING HCL CAN RESULT IN EXTREMELY NEGATIVE INTRA-CRYSTALLINE SBOM 34S VALUES. 2018 ELSEVIER B.V."
