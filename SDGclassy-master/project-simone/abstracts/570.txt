"1836" "FOAM FLOTATION IS AN EFFECTIVE AND ENERGY EFFICIENT METHOD OF HARVESTING MICROALGAE. THIS STUDY HAS INVESTIGATED THE INFLUENCE OF GROWTH PHASE AND LIPID CONTENT ON HARVESTING EFFICIENCY. THE HIGHEST BIOMASS CONCENTRATION FACTORS WERE GAINED DURING ACTIVE CULTURE GROWTH. SURPRISINGLY, THE QUANTITIES OF LIPID RECOVERED FROM MICROALGAE HARVESTED BY FOAM FLOTATION USING THE SURFACTANT CETYL TRIMETHYLAMMONIUM BROMIDE (CTAB), WERE SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER THAN FROM CELLS HARVESTED BY CENTRIFUGATION. FURTHER, CELLS HARVESTED BY CTAB-AIDED FOAM FLOTATION EXHIBITED A LIPID PROFILE MORE SUITED TO BIODIESEL CONVERSION CONTAINING INCREASED LEVELS OF SATURATED AND MONOUNSATURATED FATTY ACIDS. THE ENHANCED LIPID RECOVERY WAS PARTIALLY EXPLAINED BY THE INTERACTION OF THE CELLS WITH THE SURFACTANT, CTAB, WHICH ADSORBED ONTO THE ALGAE AND WAS CARRIED OVER INTO THE TOTAL LIPID EXTRACTION PROCESS. HOWEVER, FURTHER EVIDENCE ALSO SUGGESTED THAT CTAB PROMOTED IN SITU CELL LYSIS BY SOLUBILISING THE PHOSPHOLIPID BILAYER, THUS INCREASING THE AMOUNT OF EXTRACTABLE LIPID. THIS WORK DEMONSTRATES SUBSTANTIAL ADDED VALUE OF FOAM FLOTATION AS A MICROALGAE HARVESTING METHOD BEYOND ENERGY EFFICIENT BIOMASS RECOVERY. 2014 THE AUTHORS."
