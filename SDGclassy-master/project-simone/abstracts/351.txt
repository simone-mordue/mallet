"364" "BY INVERTING THE COMMON STRUCTURAL MOTIF OF THERMALLY ACTIVATED DELAYED FLUORESCENCE MATERIALS TO A RIGID DONOR CORE AND MULTIPLE PERIPHERAL ACCEPTORS, REVERSE INTERSYSTEM CROSSING (RISC) RATES ARE DEMONSTRATED IN AN ORGANIC MATERIAL THAT ENABLES UTILIZATION OF TRIPLET EXCITED STATES AT FASTER RATES THAN IR-BASED PHOSPHORESCENT MATERIALS. A COMBINATION OF THE INVERTED STRUCTURE AND MULTIPLE DONORACCEPTOR INTERACTIONS YIELDS UP TO 30 VIBRONICALLY COUPLED SINGLET AND TRIPLET STATES WITHIN 0.2 EV THAT ARE INVOLVED IN RISC. THIS GIVES A SIGNIFICANT ENHANCEMENT TO THE RISC RATE, LEADING TO DELAYED FLUORESCENCE DECAY TIMES AS LOW AS 103.9 NS. THIS NEW MATERIAL ALSO HAS AN EMISSION QUANTUM YIELD 1 AND A VERY SMALL SINGLETTRIPLET GAP. THIS WORK SHOWS THAT IT IS POSSIBLE TO ACHIEVE BOTH HIGH PHOTOLUMINESCENCE QUANTUM YIELD AND FAST RISC IN THE SAME MOLECULE.
