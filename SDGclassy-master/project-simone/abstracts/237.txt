"265" "BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: SEVERAL SERUM BASED-MARKERS AND RATIOS HAVE BEEN INVESTIGATED FOR THEIR PROGNOSTIC VALUE IN PANCREATIC DUCTAL ADENOCARCINOMA (PDAC). THIS COHORT STUDY AIMED TO COMBINE THESE INTO A NOVEL PROGNOSTIC SCORING SYSTEM. METHODS: A RETROSPECTIVE COHORT STUDY WAS PERFORMED ON 145 PATIENTS WITH UNRESECTABLE HISTOLOGICALLY-CONFIRMED PDAC. BASED ON THE EXISTING LITERATURE THE FOLLOWING MARKERS WERE INVESTIGATED: NEUTROPHIL-LYMPHOCYTE RATIO (NLR), NEUTROPHIL-ALBUMIN RATIO (NAR), PLATELET-LYMPHOCYTE RATIO (PLR), FIBRINOGEN, AND CA19-9. THESE VALUES WERE DICHOTOMIZED ABOUT THEIR MEDIANS FOR KAPLAN-MEIER AND COX REGRESSION ANALYSIS. RESULTS: UNIVARIATE COX REGRESSION REVEALED STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT PROGNOSTIC VALUE FOR: NLR, NAR, PLR, FIBRINOGEN, AND CA19-9. WHEN COMBINING THESE USING COX REGRESSION ANALYSIS ADJUSTING FOR OTHER PROGNOSTIC INDICATORS, ONLY NAR (HAZARD RATIOS [HR]=3.174, P=0.022) AND CA19-9 (HR=2.697, P=0.031) WERE INDEPENDENT PREDICTORS OF SURVIVAL. COMBINING NAR AND CA19-9 WE SPLIT THE COHORT INTO THREE NARCA GROUPS: NARCA0=NAR 0.13 AND CA19-9 770, NARCA1=EITHER NAR > 0.13 OR CA19-9 >770, NARCA2=NAR > 0.13 AND CA19-9 > 770. MEDIAN SURVIVAL WAS 20.5, 9.7 AND 4.1 MONTHS IN NARCA0, 1, AND 2 RESPECTIVELY (P < 0.0005, LOG-RANK TEST). A SEPARATE VALIDATION COHORT CONFIRMED THE PROGNOSTIC SIGNIFICANCE OF THE SCORE (P=0.048). CONCLUSIONS: COMBINING NAR AND CA19-9 INTO A PROGNOSTIC SCORE ALLOWS STRATIFICATION OF UNRESECTABLE PDAC PATIENTS INTO GROUPS WITH SIGNIFICANTLY DIFFERENT OVERALL SURVIVAL. 2018 WILEY PERIODICALS, INC."
