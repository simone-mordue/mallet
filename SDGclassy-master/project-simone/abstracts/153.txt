"1643" "AIR-STABLE, FLUORESCENT PRIMARY PHOSPHINES HAVE BEEN PREPARED ON A MULTIGRAM SCALE. THE TWO KEY SYNTHETIC STEPS ARE AN OPTIMIZED PALLADIUM-CATALYZED PHOSPHONYLATION OF ARYL BROMIDES AND A BORON-CARBON BOND FORMATION REACTION. THE METHOD PROVIDES A VALUABLE SYNTHETIC ROUTE TO NOVEL FLUORESCENT DERIVATIVES VIA A KEY PHOSPHONATE INTERMEDIATE. GEORG THIEME VERLAG STUTTGART NEW YORK."
