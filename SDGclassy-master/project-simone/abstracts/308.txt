"1476" "BARNACLE CYPRIDS EXHIBIT A COMPLEX SWIMMING AND EXPLORATORY BEHAVIOUR ON SURFACES AND SETTLEMENT IS A CONSEQUENCE OF EXTENSIVE SURFACE PROBING AND SELECTION OF SUITABLE SETTLEMENT SITES. IN THIS WORK, THE BEHAVIOUR OF CYPRIDS IN THEIR PRE-SETTLEMENT PHASE WAS STUDIED BY THREE-DIMENSIONAL VIDEO STEREOSCOPY. WITH THIS TECHNIQUE, THREE-DIMENSIONAL TRAJECTORIES WERE OBTAINED THAT WERE QUANTITATIVELY ANALYSED. THE VELOCITY DURING VERTICAL SINKING OF CYPRIDS OF BALANUS AMPHITRITEWAS USED WITH A MODIFIED FORM OF STOKES' LAW TO CALCULATE THEIR MEAN BODY DENSITY. FURTHERMORE, A CLASSIFICATION OF THE SWIMMING PATTERNS ALLOWED THE EXTENSION OF EXISTING MODELS DESCRIBING CYPRID LOCOMOTION AND SWIMMING BEHAVIOUR. THE PATTERNS WERE CHARACTERIZED WITH RESPECT TO THEIR OCCURRENCE, TRANSITION BETWEEN PATTERNS AND THEIR VELOCITY DISTRIBUTION, AND MOTIONS WERE IDENTIFIED THAT LED TO SURFACE CONTACTS. THIS ANALYSIS PROVIDES A CLASSIFICATION FRAMEWORK, WHICH CAN ASSIST FUTURE ATTEMPTS TO IDENTIFY BEHAVIOURAL RESPONSES OF CYPRIDS TO SPECIFIC SETTLEMENT CUES. 2014 THE AUTHOR(S) PUBLISHED BY THE ROYAL SOCIETY."
