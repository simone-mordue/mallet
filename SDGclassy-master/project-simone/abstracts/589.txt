"1054" "FTIR SPECTROSCOPY COUPLED WITH AN ATTENUATED TOTAL REFLECTION (ATR) SAMPLING PROBE HAS BEEN DEMONSTRATED AS A TECHNIQUE FOR DETECTING DISEASE IN PLANTS. SPECTRAL DIFFERENCES WERE DETECTED IN JAPANESE LARCH (LARIX KAEMPFERI) INFECTED WITH PHYTOPHTHORA RAMORUM AT 3403 CM-1 AND 1730 CM-1, FROM PINE (PINUS SPP.) INFECTED WITH BURSAPHELENCHUS XYLOPHILUS AT 1070 CM-1, 1425 CM-1, 1621 CM-1 AND 3403 CM-1 AND FROM CITRUS (CITRUS SPP.) INFECTED WITH 'CANDIDATUS LIBERIBACTER' AT 960 CM-1, 1087 CM-1, 1109 CM-1, 1154 CM-1, 1225 CM-1, 1385 CM-1, 1462 CM-1, 1707 CM-1, 2882 CM-1, 2982 CM-1 AND 3650 CM-1. A SPECTRAL MARKER IN HEALTHY CITRUS HAS BEEN IDENTIFIED AS PENTANONE BUT IS ABSENT FROM THE DISEASED SAMPLE SPECTRA. THIS AGREES WITH RECENT WORK BY AKSENOV, 2014. ADDITIONALLY, THE SPECTRAL SIGNATURE OF CUTIN WAS IDENTIFIED IN THE SPECTRA OF PINUS SPP. AND CITRUS SPP. AND IS CONSISTENT WITH WORK BY DUBIS, 1999 AND HEREDIA-GUERRERO, 2014. 2016 ELSEVIER B.V.
