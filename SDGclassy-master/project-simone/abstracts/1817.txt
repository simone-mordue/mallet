"62" "UV RESISTANCE OF BACTERIA ISOLATED FROMTHE MARINE CYANOBACTERIUM MOOREA PRODUCENSHAS NOT BEEN OBSERVED PREVIOUSLY, FINDINGS WHICH HIGHLIGHT HOW UNSAFEGERMICIDAL UV IRRADIATION FOR STERILIZATION OF AIR, FOOD, AND WATER COULD BE. FURTHER, UV RESISTANCE OF BACILLUS LICHENIFORMIS IS BEING OBSERVED FOR THE FIRST TIME. THIS STUDY FOCUSED ON BACTERIA ISOLATED FROM THE MARINE CYANOBACTERIUM M.PRODUCENS COLLECTED OFF THE KENYAN COAST AT SHIMONI, WASINI, KILIFI, AND MIDA. UV IRRADIANCE OF ISOLATES(302NM, 70W/M 2 , 01HR) ESTABLISHED B.LICHENIFORMIS AS THE MOST UV RESISTANT STRAIN, WITH THE FOLLOWING ORDER OF TAXON RESISTANCE:BACILLI&GT, PROTEOBACTERIA&GT,ACTINOBACTERIA. UV RESISTANCE WAS INDEPENDENT OF PIGMENTATION. THE MAXIMUM LIKELIHOOD PHYLOGENETIC DISTANCE DETERMINED FOR BOTH B.LICHENIFORMIS AND BACILLUS AERIUS RELATIVE TO M.PRODUCENS CCAP 1446/4 WAS 2.0. SURVIVAL OFB. LICHENIFORMISUPON UV IRRADIANCE FOLLOWED FIRST-ORDER KINETICS (K=0.035/MIN, R 2 =0.88). ADDITION OFAQUEOUS EXTRACTS (2, 10, 20 AND 40MG/ML) OF THIS B.LICHENIFORMIS STRAIN ON THE LESS RESISTANT MARINOBACTERIUM STANIERI WAS NOT SIGNIFICANT, HOWEVER, THE COMMERCIAL SUNSCREEN BENZOPHENONE-3 (BP-3) POSITIVE CONTROL AND THE TIME OF IRRADIANCE WERE SIGNIFICANT. DETECTION OF BACTERIA ON M.PRODUCENS FILAMENTS STAINED WITH ACRIDINE ORANGE CONFIRMED ITS NONAXENIC NATURE. ALTHOUGH THE CHEMISTRY OF UV RESISTANCE IN CYANOBACTERIA HAS BEEN STUDIED IN DEPTH REVEALING FOR EXAMPLE THE ROLE OF MYCOSPORINE LIKE AMINO ACIDS (MAAS) IN UV RESISTANCE LESS IS KNOWN ABOUT HOW BACTERIA RESIST UV IRRADIATION. THIS IS OF INTEREST SINCE CYANOBACTERIA LIVE IN ASSOCIATION WITH BACTERIA. 2018 THE AUTHORS. MICROBIOLOGYOPEN PUBLISHED BY JOHN WILEY & SONS LTD."
