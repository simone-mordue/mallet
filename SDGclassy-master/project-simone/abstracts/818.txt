"202" "MALAYSIA IS ANTICIPATING AN INCREASE OF 68.86% IN CO 2 EMISSION IN 2020, COMPARED WITH THE 2000 BASELINE, REACHING 285.73 MILLION TONNES. A MAJOR CONTRIBUTOR TO MALAYSIAS CO 2 EMISSIONS IS COAL-FIRED ELECTRICITY POWER PLANTS, RESPONSIBLE FOR 43.4% OF THE OVERALL EMISSIONS. MALAYSIAS FOREST SOIL OFFERS ORGANIC SEQUESTRATION OF 15 TONNES OF CO 2 HA 1 YEAR 1 . UNLIKE ORGANIC CO 2 SEQUESTRATION IN SOIL, INORGANIC SEQUESTRATION OF CO 2 THROUGH MINERAL CARBONATION, ONCE FORMED, IS CONSIDERED AS A PERMANENT SINK. INORGANIC CO 2 SEQUESTRATION IN MALAYSIA HAS NOT BEEN EXTENSIVELY STUDIED, AND THE COUNTRYS POTENTIAL FOR USING THE TECHNIQUE FOR ATMOSPHERIC CO 2 REMOVAL IS UNDEFINED. IN ADDITION, MALAYSIA PRODUCES A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF SOLID WASTE ANNUALLY AND, OF THAT, DEMOLITION CONCRETE WASTE, BASALT QUARRY FINE, AND FLY AND BOTTOM ASHES ARE CALCIUM-RICH MATERIALS SUITABLE FOR INORGANIC CO 2 SEQUESTRATION. THIS PROJECT INTRODUCES A POTENTIAL SOLUTION FOR SEQUESTERING ATMOSPHERIC CO 2 INORGANICALLY FOR MALAYSIA. IF LANDS ASSOCIATED TO FUTURE DEVELOPMENTS IN MALAYSIA ARE DESIGNED FOR INORGANIC CO 2 SEQUESTRATION USING DEMOLITION CONCRETE WASTE, BASALT QUARRY FINE, AND FLY AND BOTTOM ASHES, 597,465 TONNES OF CO 2 CAN BE CAPTURED ANNUALLY ADDING A POTENTIAL ANNUAL ECONOMIC BENEFIT OF 4,700,000. 2018 BY THE AUTHORS.
