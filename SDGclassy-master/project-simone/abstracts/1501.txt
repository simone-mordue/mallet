"524" "THE OBJECTIVE OF THIS PAPER WAS TO EXAMINE FARMER-DIRECTED TECHNOLOGY ADAPTATION OF SELECTED WATER HARVESTING TECHNOLOGIES (WHTS) IN ORDER TO ENHANCE THEIR POTENTIAL CONTRIBUTION TO FOOD SECURITY AND LIVELIHOOD IMPROVEMENT IN SUB-SAHARAN AFRICA. THE SELECTED WHTS INCLUDED MICRO- AND MESO-SCALE RESERVOIRS THAT STORE WATER IN THE SOIL (IN SITU) OR IN A RESERVOIR, RESPECTIVELY: HOUSEHOLD PONDS IN ETHIOPIA, NDIVA SYSTEMS IN TANZANIA AND COMBINATIONS OF MECHANIZED ZA, GRASS STRIPS AND BUNDS IN BURKINA FASO. THE IMPACT OF NON-ADAPTED WHTS WAS BELOW EXPECTATION. ALTHOUGH WHTS IMPROVED YIELDS, MOST FAMILIES WERE UNABLE TO MEET THEIR (NUTRITIONAL) FOOD NEEDS EVERY YEAR AND EXPERIENCED LIMITED OR NO LONG-TERM EFFECTS ON SUSTAINABLE LIVELIHOOD. THE LINING OF HOUSEHOLD PONDS AND CONVEYANCE CANALS WITH DURABLE MATERIALS GAVE PROMISING RESULTS, YET NEEDS ECONOMIC CONSIDERATION, A MINIMUM INVESTMENT MAY FORM A BARRIER PARTICULARLY TO RESOURCE-POOR FARMERS. INCORPORATION OF THE LOCATION-SPECIFIC NATURE OF FARMING AND LIVELIHOODS INTO WHT INTERVENTIONS IS RECOMMENDED, ALONG WITH INCENTIVE MEASURES TO SUPPORT FARMERS INCLUDING THE PROVISION OF ACCESS TO CREDITS AND INPUTS FOR AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTION.
