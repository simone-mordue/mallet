A RANGE OF EMPIRICAL STUDIES THAT EXPLORED FACTORS INFLUENCING FARMERS' WILLINGNESS TO PARTICIPATE IN SUCH SCHEMES WERE SELECTED AND SYSTEMATICALLY ANALYSED.

OF PARTICULAR IMPORTANCE IS THE FINDING THAT THE DESIGN OF AGRI-ENVIRONMENTAL POLICY IS NOT THE ONLY RELEVANT FACTOR INFLUENCING UPTAKE BUT OTHER POLICIES WHICH IMPACT ON THE FARM HOUSEHOLD AND THE RURAL COMMUNITY CAN ALSO ENCOURAGE OR DISCOURAGE PARTICIPATION IN AN AES. 2015 ELSEVIER LTD."
