"68" "THE AIM WAS TO COMPARE POTENTIAL METHODS FOR FLUORIDE ANALYSIS IN MICROLITRE-VOLUME PLASMA SAMPLES CONTAINING NANO-GRAM AMOUNTS OF FLUORIDE. METHODS: A GROUP OF 4 LABORATORIES ANALYSED A SET OF STANDARDISED BIOLOGICAL SAMPLES AS WELL AS PLASMA TO DETERMINE FLUORIDE CONCENTRATION USING 3 METHODS. IN PHASE-1, FLUORIDE ANALYSIS WAS CARRIED OUT USING THE ESTABLISHED HEXAMETHYLDISILOXANE (HMDS)-DIFFUSION METHOD (1 ML-ALIQUOT/ANALYSIS) TO OBTAIN PRELIMINARY MEASUREMENT OF AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE LABORATORIES. IN PHASE-2, THE LABORATORIES ANALYSED THE SAME SAMPLES USING A MICRO-DIFFUSION METHOD AND KNOWN-ADDITION TECHNIQUE WITH 200 L-ALIQUOT/ANALYSIS. COEFFICIENTS OF VARIATION (CVS) AND INTRA-CLASS CORRELATION COEFFICIENTS (ICCS) WERE ESTIMATED USING ANALYSIS OF VARIANCE TO EVALUATE THE AMOUNT OF VARIATION WITHIN- AND BETWEEN-LABORATORIES. BASED ON THE RESULTS OF THE PHASE-2 ANALYSIS, 20 HUMAN PLASMA SAMPLES WERE ANALYSED AND COMPARED USING THE HMDS-DIFFUSION METHOD AND KNOWN-ADDITION TECHNIQUE IN PHASE-3. RESULTS: COMPARISON OF PHASE-1 RESULTS SHOWED NO STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE AMONG THE LABORATORIES FOR THE OVERALL DATA SET. THE MEAN BETWEEN- AND WITHIN-LABORATORY CVS AND ICCS WERE < 0.13 AND 0.99, RESPECTIVELY, INDICATING VERY LOW VARIABILITY AND EXCELLENT RELIABILITY. IN PHASE-2, THE OVERALL RESULTS FOR BETWEEN-LABORATORY VARIABILITY SHOWED A POOR CV (1.16) AND ICC (0.44) FOR THE MICRO-DIFFUSION METHOD, WHEREAS WITH THE KNOWN-ADDITION TECHNIQUE THE CORRESPONDING VALUES WERE 0.49 AND 0.83. PHASE-3 RESULTS SHOWED NO STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE IN FLUORIDE CONCENTRATIONS OF THE PLASMA SAMPLES MEASURED WITH HMDS-DIFFUSION METHOD AND KNOWN- ADDITION TECHNIQUE, WITH A MEAN (SE) DIFFERENCE OF 0.002 (0.003) G/ML. IN CONCLUSION, THE KNOWN-ADDITION TECHNIQUE COULD BE A SUITABLE ALTERNATIVE FOR THE MEASUREMENT OF FLUORIDE IN PLASMA WITH MICROLITRE-VOLUME SAMPLES. 2018 S. KARGER AG, BASEL."
