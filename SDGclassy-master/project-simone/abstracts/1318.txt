"845" "THE AVAILABILITY OF K, ESSENTIAL FOR PLANT GROWTH, FROM SYENITE (A SILICATE ROCK IN WHICH POTASSIUM FELDSPAR IS THE DOMINANT MINERAL, >90WT%), AND PHLOGOPITE MICA HAS BEEN DEMONSTRATED USING CAREFULLY DESIGNED PLANT GROWTH POT EXPERIMENTS IN WHICH THE ONLY ADDED SOURCE OF K WAS THE MINERAL OF INTEREST, WITH NO LOSS OF NUTRIENTS THROUGH DRAINAGE. USING PURE QUARTZ SAND AS A SOIL, BOTH GROWTH (INCREASE IN DIAMETER) OF LEEK PLANTS AND K-CONTENT OF THE PLANT MATERIAL SHOWED A DOSE-DEPENDENT POSITIVE RESPONSE TO THE APPLICATION (11443000MGK/POT) OF MILLED SYENITE WITH INCREASES IN PLANT DIAMETER OF 0.50.7MM/WEEK, INCREASING WITH APPLICATION RATE. PHLOGOPITE MICA (1146000MGK/POT) SUPPORTED THE HIGHEST OBSERVED INCREASE IN DIAMETER (APPROX. 1MM/WEEK) AND PLANT K-CONTENT, BOTH SIMILAR TO THAT OBSERVED FOR A POSITIVE CONTROL (KCL). THESE EXPERIMENTS DEMONSTRATE THAT PLANTS CAN OBTAIN K FOR GROWTH FROM MILLED SYENITE, IN WHICH FELDSPAR IS THE DOMINANT K-BEARING MINERAL, AND CONFIRM PREVIOUS OBSERVATIONS THAT MICAS CAN BE AN EFFECTIVE SOURCE OF K. 2016 ELSEVIER B.V."
