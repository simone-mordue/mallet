"1793" "SUSTAINABLE INTENSIFICATION (SI) IS A TERM THAT HAS INCREASINGLY BEEN USED TO DESCRIBE THE AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTION SYSTEMS THAT WILL BE NEEDED TO FEED A GROWING GLOBAL POPULATION WHILST ENSURING ADEQUATE ECOSYSTEM SERVICE PROVISION. HOWEVER, KEY DEFINITIONS OF SI SUPPORT QUITE DIFFERENT APPROACHES, A REPORT PUBLISHED BY THE ROYAL SOCIETY (BAULCOMBE ET AL., 2009) FAVOURS THE LAND SPARING MODEL WHILST A FORESIGHT REPORT (2011) FAVOURS LAND SHARING. SI WILL REQUIRE PRAGMATIC AND INNOVATIVE POLICIES, INCLUDING FURTHER REVISION OF THE ENVIRONMENTAL STEWARDSHIP SCHEME AND THE DEVELOPMENT OF LANDSCAPE-SCALE GOVERNANCE WITHIN AN OVER-ARCHING STRATEGIC APPROACH TO PLANNING. HOWEVER, ITS INNOVATION IS ITS FOCUS ON UNLOCKING THE SOCIAL AT THE EXPENSE OF THE PRIVATE VALUE OF LAND (AT THOSE LOCATIONS WHERE NON-MARKET ECOSYSTEM SERVICES HAVE A HIGHER VALUE THAN MARKETABLE AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTS). THOUGH SCIENTIFIC ADVANCES MAY HELP RAISE PRODUCTION EFFICIENCY THROUGH A BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF THE TRADE-OFFS BETWEEN AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTION AND ECOSYSTEM SERVICE PROVISION, ISSUES RELATED TO WHO CONTROLS THE USE OF LAND WILL BE THE MOST DIFFICULT TO RESOLVE, WHICH SUGGESTS A ROLE FOR BOUNDARY ORGANISATIONAL THEORY (BOT) BECAUSE OF THE INSIGHTS THIS THEORY LENDS TO NEGOTIATING COMPLEX PROBLEMS. WITHIN BOT TERMINOLOGY SI CAN BE CONSIDERED A \"BOUNDARY OBJECT\" ABOUT WHICH STAKEHOLDERS ARE ABLE TO NEGOTIATE SITE-SPECIFIC ISSUES TO INCREMENTALLY ARRIVE AT SOLUTIONS WHICH DRAW ON THE FULL RANGE OF LAND SHARING AND LAND SPARING OPTIONS AND SO AVOID PRESCRIPTIVE APPROACHES AND TECHNOLOGIES. 2014 ELSEVIER LTD."
