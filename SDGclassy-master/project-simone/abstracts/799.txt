"653" "LIPIDS AFFECT STABLE ISOTOPE VALUES GENERATED FOR MARINE FISHES, HOWEVER THESE EFFECTS REMAIN POORLY DESCRIBED FOR MANY EXTANT SHARK TAXA, ESPECIALLY DEEP-SEA SPECIES. HERE, WE REPORT THE EFFECTS OF LIPID EXTRACTION (LE) ON 13C, 15N, AND C:N VALUES OF SEVEN DEEP-SEA SHARKS, GENERATE NOVEL MATHEMATICAL NORMALIZATIONS FOR 13C BASED ON THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN BULK AND LIPID EXTRACTED VALUES (13CBULK AND 13CLE) AND EXAMINE WHETHER COMMON NORMALIZED CORRECTION MODELS PROVIDE A ROBUST METHOD FOR ADDRESSING LIPID-BIASING EFFECTS IN TWO SPECIES, THE CUBAN DOGFISH (SQUALUS CUBENSIS, N=20), AND GREENLAND SHARK (SOMNIOSUS MICROCEPHALUS, N=24). LE GENERALLY RESULTED IN ENRICHMENT OF 13C AND 15N, BUT PRODUCED VARIABLE EFFECTS ON C:N ACROSS ALL SPECIES. NOVEL MATHEMATICAL NORMALIZATIONS FOR 13C WERE DERIVED FROM THE POOLED SHARK COMMUNITY, AND A SINGLE SPECIES-SPECIFIC CORRECTION WAS GENERATED FOR THE CUBAN DOGFISH, BUT COULD NOT BE DETERMINED FOR THE GREENLAND SHARK. FOUR COMMON LIPID CORRECTION MODELS USED FOR TELEOSTS, FAILED TO ACCURATELY PREDICT 13C VALUES STATISTICALLY SIMILAR TO 13CLE, IN BOTH CUBAN DOGFISH AND GREENLAND SHARKS, LIKELY DUE TO THE CONFOUNDING EFFECTS OF LIPIDS AND UREA ON C:N. THESE OBSERVATIONS SUGGEST THAT CHEMICAL LIPID EXTRACTION SHOULD BE A MANDATORY PROCEDURE PRIOR TO INTERPRETING STABLE ISOTOPE DATA FOR DEEP-SEA SHARKS, AT LEAST FOR THOSE SPECIES WHERE LIPID EFFECTS ARE LARGE. 2017 ELSEVIER B.V."
