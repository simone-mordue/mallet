"1398" "THE PROPERTIES OF 13 MONODENTATE P-DONOR LIGANDS NOT PREVIOUSLY CHARACTERIZED IN THE LIGAND KNOWLEDGE BASE (LKB) APPROACH HAVE BEEN DETERMINED COMPUTATIONALLY, ALLOWING THEIR ADDITION TO THE LKB-P MAP OF LIGAND SPACE. CONSIDERATION OF LIGAND POSITIONS AND CLOSE NEIGHBORS IN LIGAND SPACE CAN HELP TO ESTABLISH A CHEMICAL CONTEXT AND HENCE GUIDE THEIR APPLICATION TO ORGANOMETALLIC CATALYSIS. HERE WE DEMONSTRATE THIS POTENTIAL APPLICATION OF THE LKB-P MAP AND DISCUSS KNOWN AND LIKELY APPLICATIONS OF THESE LIGANDS. COPYRIGHT 2015 TAYLOR & FRANCIS GROUP, LLC."
