"1551" "TWO LIBRARIES OF SUBSTITUTED BENZIMIDAZOLES WERE DESIGNED USING A 'SCAFFOLD-HOPPING' APPROACH BASED ON REPORTED MDM2-P53 INHIBITORS. SUBSTITUENTS WERE CHOSEN FOLLOWING LIBRARY ENUMERATION AND DOCKING INTO AN MDM2 X-RAY STRUCTURE. BENZIMIDAZOLE LIBRARIES WERE PREPARED USING AN EFFICIENT SOLUTION-PHASE APPROACH AND SCREENED FOR INHIBITION OF THE MDM2-P53 AND MDMX-P53 PROTEIN-PROTEIN INTERACTIONS. KEY EXAMPLES SHOWED INHIBITORY ACTIVITY AGAINST BOTH TARGETS. 2014 JOHN WILEY & SONS A/S."
