"1264" "OWING TO THE RENEWED INTEREST IN DARK MATTER AFTER THE UPGRADE OF THE LARGE HADRON COLLIDER AND ITS DEDICATION TO DARK-MATTER RESEARCH, IT IS TIMELY TO REASSESS THE WHOLE PROBLEM. CONSIDERING DARK MATTER IS ONE WAY TO RECONCILE THE DISCREPANCY BETWEEN THE VELOCITY OF MATTER IN THE OUTER REGIONS OF GALAXIES AND THE OBSERVED GALACTIC MASS. THUS FAR, NO CREDIBLE CANDIDATE FOR DARK MATTER HAS BEEN IDENTIFIED. HERE, WE DEVELOP A MODEL ACCOUNTING FOR OBSERVATIONS BY ROTATIONS AND INTERACTIONS BETWEEN ROTATING OBJECTS ANALOGOUS TO MAGNETIC FIELDS AND INTERACTIONS WITH MOVING CHARGES. THE MAGNITUDE OF THESE FIELDS IS DESCRIBED BY A FUNDAMENTAL CONSTANT ON THE ORDER OF 1041KG1. THE SAME INTERACTIONS CAN BE OBSERVED IN THE SOLAR SYSTEM, WHERE THEY LEAD TO SMALL CHANGES IN PLANETARY ORBITS. 2015, THE AUTHOR(S)."
