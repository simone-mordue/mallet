"1525" "THE DECLINE OF BUMBLEBEES IN EUROPE HAS BEEN LINKED PRIMARILY TO AGRICULTURAL INTENSIFICATION, ALTHOUGH CLIMATE CHANGE ALSO HAS THE POTENTIAL TO DISRUPT PLANT-POLLINATOR INTERACTIONS, PARTLY THROUGH AN INCREASED FREQUENCY OF EXTREME SHORT-TERM WEATHER EVENTS. THERE HAVE BEEN FEW ATTEMPTS TO USE TIME-SERIES MODELS TO DETERMINE METEOROLOGICAL VARIABLES AFFECTING FORAGER ACTIVITY AT HOURLY TIME PERIODS OVER SEVERAL MONTHS. TIME-SERIES MODELS REQUIRE LARGE DATASETS TO BE RELIABLE. WE DESCRIBE THE USE OF INFRARED DETECTORS AT NEST ENTRANCES TO RECORD FORAGER EXITS/RETURNS FROM 36 CAPTIVE COLONIES OF BOMBUS TERRESTRIS AUDAX ON A MIXED FARM IN NORTHERN ENGLAND, RECORDING OVER A 78-DAY PERIOD. OVER 1.73MILLION INDIVIDUAL RECORDS OF FORAGER ACTIVITY WERE OBTAINED. THESE WERE AGGREGATED INTO 1872 HOURLY BLOCKS AND ANALYZED WITH AUTOREGRESSIVE TIME-SERIES MODELS THAT USED NINE METEOROLOGICAL FACTORS AS EXPLANATORY VARIABLES. FORAGER ACTIVITY WAS POSITIVELY LINKED TO AIR TEMPERATURE AND SOLAR ELEVATION, AND NEGATIVELY ASSOCIATED WITH RAINFALL, HUMIDITY AND WIND-SPEED. THE EFFECTS OF INCREASED VARIABILITY IN METEOROLOGICAL CONDITIONS ARE CONSIDERED IN THE CONTEXT OF THESE RESULTS. THE TIME-SERIES MODELS THAT WE DESCRIBE WILL BE USEFUL IN FUTURE ANALYSES OF THE LARGE DATASETS OF FORAGING BEHAVIOUR THAT ARE BECOMING AVAILABLE THROUGH NEW TECHNOLOGIES SUCH AS RADIO-FREQUENCY IDENTIFICATION AND VIDEO TRACKING. 2015 THE ROYAL ENTOMOLOGICAL SOCIETY."
