"1709" "TWO CHROMO-FLUOROGENIC PROBES, EACH BASED ON THE BORON DIPYRROMETHENE CORE, HAVE BEEN DEVELOPED FOR THE DETECTION OF NERVE-AGENT MIMICS. THESE CHEMOSENSORS DISPLAY BOTH A COLOR CHANGE AND A SIGNIFICANT ENHANCEMENT OF FLUORESCENCE IN THE PRESENCE OF DIETHYLCYANOPHOSPHONATE (DCNP) AND DIISOPROPYLFLUOROPHOSPHATE (DFP). NO INTERFERENCE FROM OTHER ORGANOPHOSPHORUS COMPOUNDS OR ACIDS HAS BEEN OBSERVED. TWO PORTABLE CHEMOSENSOR KITS HAVE BEEN DEVELOPED AND TESTED TO DEMONSTRATE ITS PRACTICAL APPLICATION IN REAL-TIME MONITORING. FOR ALL TO SEE: TWO NEW BORON DIPYRROMETHENE (BODIPY) DERIVATIVES HAVE BEEN SYNTHESIZED AND USED AS NAKED-EYE COLORIMETRIC AND FLUORESCENCE PROBES FOR THE DETECTION OF NERVE-AGENT SIMULANTS (SEE PICTURE, DCNP=DIETHYLCYANOPHOSPHONATE, DFP=DIISOPROPYLFLUOROPHOSPHATE). SELECTIVITY TO NERVE-AGENT SIMULANTS VERSUS ACIDIC MEDIA HAS BEEN ACHIEVED. TWO PORTABLE CHEMOSENSOR KITS HAVE BEEN USED IN REAL-TIME MONITORING. 2014 WILEY-VCH VERLAG GMBH & CO. KGAA, WEINHEIM."
