"1488" "WHILE THERE ARE MANY CASE STUDIES LOOKING AT GENDER MAINSTREAMING IN NATIONAL CONTEXTS, THIS ARTICLE OFFERS A PAN-EUROPEAN PERSPECTIVE TO EXAMINE HOW A STATED COMMITMENT TO GENDER EQUALITY AT THIS META-LEVEL WORKS IN PRACTICE. THE EUROPEAN UNION'S (EU) STATED COMMITMENT TO GENDER MAINSTREAMING THE COMMON AGRICULTURAL POLICY (CAP) IS CRITICALLY REVIEWED. THE ARTICLE REVIEWS THEORETICAL LITERATURE ON GENDER MAINSTREAMING, CONSIDERS THE POSITION OF WOMEN IN AGRICULTURE ACROSS EUROPE, AND EXAMINES EFFORTS BY THE EU TO GENDER MAINSTREAM THE CAP. IT ARGUES THAT AT BEST, GENDER MAINSTREAMING FOCUSES ON THE SYMPTOMS OF GENDER INEQUALITY IN AGRICULTURE RATHER THAN THE CAUSES. BECAUSE OF THIS, GENDER MAINSTREAMING CANNOT BE TRANSFORMATIVE IN THIS CONTEXT. LITTLE THOUGHT HAS BEEN GIVEN TO THE PRACTICAL DIFFICULTIES OF ACTUALLY GENDER MAINSTREAMING A POLICY SUCH AS THE CAP. THE EU'S PRIORITY FOR THE CAP FOCUSES ON THE MAINSTREAM BUSINESS GOAL OF A VIABLE AGRICULTURAL INDUSTRY AND DOES NOT PAY ANY HEED TO GENDER INEQUALITIES IN AGRICULTURE. IN SHORT, THE STATED COMMITMENT TO GENDER MAINSTREAMING IS EMPTY RHETORIC. 2014, 2014 TAYLOR & FRANCIS."
