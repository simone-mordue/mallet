IN AN ATTEMPT TO MAINTAIN RURAL POPULATIONS, RURAL DEVELOPMENT SCHEMES HAVE BEEN CREATED THAT OFFER THE OPPORTUNITY TO RURAL HOUSEHOLDS TO MAINTAIN OR EXPAND THEIR FARMING BUSINESSES INCLUDING VINE-GROWING. THIS PAPER STEMS FROM A STUDY THAT USED DATA FROM A CROSS-SECTIONAL SURVEY OF 204 FARMERS TO INVESTIGATE HOW FARMING SYSTEMS AND FARMERS' PERCEPTION OF CORRUPTION, AMONGST OTHER SOCIO-ECONOMIC FACTORS, AFFECTED THEIR DECISIONS TO CONTINUE VINE-GROWING THROUGH PARTICIPATION IN RURAL DEVELOPMENT SCHEMES, IN THREE REMOTE LESS-FAVOURED AREAS OF GREECE. THE THEORY OF PLANNED BEHAVIOUR WAS USED TO FRAME THE RESEARCH PROBLEM WITH THE ASSUMPTION BEING THAT AN INDIVIDUAL'S INTENTION TO PARTICIPATE IN A SCHEME IS BASED ON THEIR PRIOR BELIEFS ABOUT IT. DATA FROM THE SURVEY WERE REDUCED AND SIMPLIFIED BY THE USE OF NON-LINEAR PRINCIPAL COMPONENT ANALYSIS. THE ENSUING VARIABLES WERE USED IN SELECTIVITY CORRECTED ORDERED PROBIT MODELS TO REVEAL FARMERS' ATTITUDES TOWARDS VITICULTURE AND RURAL DEVELOPMENT. IT WAS FOUND THAT ECONOMIC FACTORS, PERCEIVED CORRUPTION AND FARMERS' ATTITUDES WERE SIGNIFICANT DETERMINANTS ON WHETHER TO PARTICIPATE IN THE SCHEMES. THE RESEARCH FINDINGS HIGHLIGHT THE IMPORTANT ROLE OF PERCEIVED CORRUPTION AND THE NEED FOR POLICIES THAT FACILITATE FARMERS' ACCESS TO DECISION MAKING CENTRES. 2015 ELSEVIER LTD."
