"1349" "THE TAXONOMIC POSITION OF AN AEROBIC ACTINOBACTERIAL STRAIN, BMG841T, ISOLATED FROM THE BULLA REGIA MONUMENT (TUNISIA) AND EXHIBITING A HIGH RESISTANCE TO GAMMA-RADIATION (D10 ~9 KGY) WAS DETERMINED USING POLYPHASIC APPROACH. THE OPTIMAL GROWTH RANGE WAS FOUND TO BE 25-35 C AT PH OF 7.0-8.5. THE STRAIN WAS OBSERVED TO FORM BLACK DRY COLONIES. CHEMOTAXONOMIC CHARACTERISTICS OF THE ISOLATE SHOWED A CELL WALL TYPE III, WITH GALACTOSE AND GLUCOSE AS DIAGNOSTIC SUGARS, PHOSPHATIDYLCHOLINE, PHOSPHATIDYLINOSITOL, DIPHOSPHATIDYLGLYCEROL, PHOSPHATIDYLETHANOLAMINE AND AN UNIDENTIFIED GLYCOLIPID AS MAIN POLAR LIPIDS, AND MK- 9(H4) AS THE PREDOMINANT MENAQUINONE. THE MAJOR CELLULAR FATTY ACIDS WERE IDENTIFIED AS ISO-C16:0 AND ISO- C15:0. PHYLOGENETIC ANALYSIS INDICATED THAT STRAIN BMG841T REPRESENTS A NOVEL MEMBER OF THE GENUS GEODERMATOPHILUS WITH HIGH 16S RRNA GENE SEQUENCE IDENTITY WITH GEODERMATOPHILUS SAHARENSIS (98.28%). BASED ON PHYLOGENETIC AND PHENOTYPIC ANALYSIS, STRAIN BMG841T IS PROPOSED AS THE TYPE STRAIN (=DSM 46841T=CECT 8821T) OF A NOVEL SPECIES, GEODERMATOPHILUS BULLAREGIENSIS.
