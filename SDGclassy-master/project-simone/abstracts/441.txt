"365" "CYANOGENIC GLUCOSIDES ARE NITROGEN-CONTAINING SPECIALIZED METABOLITES THAT PROVIDE CHEMICAL DEFENSE AGAINST HERBIVORES AND PATHOGENS VIA THE RELEASE OF TOXIC HYDROGEN CYANIDE. IT HAS BEEN SUGGESTED THAT CYANOGENIC GLUCOSIDES ARE ALSO A STORE OF NITROGEN THAT CAN BE REMOBILIZED FOR GENERAL METABOLISM VIA A PREVIOUSLY UNKNOWN PATHWAY. HERE WE REVEAL A RECYCLING PATHWAY FOR THE CYANOGENIC GLUCOSIDE DHURRIN IN SORGHUM (SORGHUM BICOLOR) THAT AVOIDS HYDROGEN CYANIDE FORMATION. AS DEMONSTRATED INVITRO, THE PATHWAY PROCEEDS VIA SPONTANEOUS FORMATION OF A DHURRIN-DERIVED GLUTATHIONE CONJUGATE, WHICH UNDERGOES REDUCTIVE CLEAVAGE BY GLUTATHIONE TRANSFERASES OF THE PLANT-SPECIFIC LAMBDA CLASS (GSTLS) TO PRODUCE P-HYDROXYPHENYL ACETONITRILE. THIS IS FURTHER METABOLIZED TO P-HYDROXYPHENYLACETIC ACID AND FREE AMMONIA BY NITRILASES, AND THEN GLUCOSYLATED TO FORM P-GLUCOSYLOXYPHENYLACETIC ACID. TWO OF THE FOUR GSTLS IN SORGHUM EXHIBITED HIGH STEREOSPECIFIC CATALYTIC ACTIVITY TOWARDS THE GLUTATHIONE CONJUGATE, AND FORM A SUBCLADE IN A PHYLOGENETIC TREE OF GSTLS IN HIGHER PLANTS. THE EXPRESSION OF THE CORRESPONDING TWO GSTLS CO-LOCALIZED WITH EXPRESSION OF THE GENES ENCODING THE P-HYDROXYPHENYL ACETONITRILE-METABOLIZING NITRILASES AT THE CELLULAR LEVEL. THE ELUCIDATION OF THIS PATHWAY PLACES GSTS AS KEY PLAYERS IN A REMARKABLE SCHEME FOR METABOLIC PLASTICITY ALLOWING PLANTS TO REVERSE THE RESOURCE FLOW BETWEEN GENERAL AND SPECIALIZED METABOLISM IN ACTIVELY GROWING TISSUE. 2018 THE AUTHORS.
