"960" "INTERPRETATION OF A THREE-DIMENSIONAL (3-D) SEISMIC DATASET FROM OFFSHORE OF MAURITANIA REVEALS A SHEAR ZONE AT THE BASE OF A PARTIALLY DEVELOPED SLOPE FAILURE. THE SHEAR ZONE IS AT A DEPTH OF ~220M BELOW THE SEABED, IMMEDIATELY ABOVE A HYDRATE BOTTOM SIMULATING REFLECTOR (BSR). WE PROPOSE THAT A PALEO-GAS ACCUMULATION TRAPPED BELOW HYDRATE WAS THE PRIMER FOR WHAT WOULD HAVE BEEN A SUBSTANTIAL SUBMARINE SLOPE FAILURE OF ~220M THICKNESS, COVERING ~50KM2. THIS IS BASED ON THE FOLLOWING OBSERVATIONS: (A) THE SHEAR SURFACE IS, AT THE LEVEL OF SEISMIC RESOLUTION, COINCIDENT WITH SOME PRESENT GAS ACCUMULATIONS LOCATED IMMEDIATELY BELOW SEDIMENT THAT HOSTS HYDRATE, (B) THERE ARE REMNANTS OF A MORE EXTENSIVE PALEO GAS ACCUMULATION THAT WOULD HAVE GENERATED SUFFICIENT BUOYANCY PRESSURE FOR THE SHEAR SURFACE TO BE CRITICALLY STRESSED AND THEREFORE PRIMED THE FAILURE, (C) SEISMIC PIPES ARE A COMMON SEISMIC FEATURE WITHIN THE STUDIED SUCCESSION BUT ABSENT IN THE AREA OF THE SHEAR ZONE, WHICH SUPPORTS THE HYPOTHESIS THAT A HIGH GAS COLUMN COULD HAVE EXISTED. THIS IS A RARE EXAMPLE OF A SHEAR ZONE THAT DID NOT LEAD TO THE COMPLETE DEVELOPMENT OF A SLOPE FAILURE. IT PROVIDES THE FIRST SEISMIC EVIDENCE THAT THE BUOYANCY EFFECT OF GAS BELOW THE HYDRATE RATHER THAN THE HYDRATE DISSOCIATION IS ALSO A VIABLE MECHANISM FOR LARGE-SCALE SLOPE FAILURES. 2016" "GAS TRAPPED BELOW HYDRATE AS A PRIMER FOR SUBMARINE SLOPE FAILURES" "BSR; BUOYANCY; GAS ACCUMULATION; GAS HYDRATE; SUBMARINE FAILURE"
