"101" "THE FEASIBILITY OF USING POTATO PROCESSING WASTE (PPW) AS A CO-SUBSTRATE FOR CO-DIGESTION WITH A MARINE MICROALGA (TISOCHRYSIS LUTEA) WAS EVALUATED DURING SEMI-CONTINUOUS CO-DIGESTION STUDIES, IN WHICH THE EFFECTS OF DIGESTER START-UP STRATEGY (FED, AND UNFED) AND PPW TYPE (POTATO DISCARDED PARTS, PPW DP , POTATO PEEL, PPW P ) WERE EXAMINED. RESULTS SHOWED THAT METHANE YIELDS WERE SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECTED BY THE START-UP STRATEGIES USED, WITH SEMI-CONTINUOUS DIGESTERS THAT WERE IMMEDIATE FED WITH 100% PPW DP OR PPW P (FED START-UP) SHOWING SIGNIFICANTLY ENHANCED METHANE YIELDS (337-374 ML CH 4 /G VS) COMPARED TO THE DIGESTERS THAT WERE NOT INITIALLY FED EITHER OF THESE SUBSTRATES (318-328 ML CH 4 /G VS). CO-DIGESTION OF T. LUTEA WITH PPW DP PRODUCED HIGHER METHANE YIELDS (328-374 ML CH 4 /G VS) THAN CO-DIGESTION WITH PPW P (318-337 ML CH 4 /G VS), BUT BOTH FEEDSTOCKS EXHIBITED GOOD POTENTIAL FOR CO-DIGESTION WITH T. LUTEA. IN ADDITION, THE FED START-UP STRATEGY AND T. LUTEA CO-DIGESTING WITH PPW DP SUPPORTED A HIGH RELATIVE ABUNDANCE OF METHANOSARCINA. OVERALL, CO-DIGESTION WITH PPW COULD BE A FEASIBLE METHOD TO REDUCE INHIBITION AND ENHANCE METHANE PRODUCTION WHEN USING MARINE MICROALGAE AS A FEEDSTOCK FOR BIOGAS PRODUCTION. 2019 ELSEVIER LTD.
