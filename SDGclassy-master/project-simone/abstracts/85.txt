"201" "A POLYPHASIC STUDY WAS UNDERTAKEN TO DETERMINE THE TAXONOMIC STATUS OF A RAPIDLY GROWING, SCOTOCHROMOGENIC ORGANISM THAT HAD BEEN RECEIVED AS MYCOBACTERIUM VACCAE NCTC 11659 T . THE ORGANISM WAS FOUND TO HAVE CHEMOTAXONOMIC AND CULTURAL PROPERTIES IN ACCORD WITH ITS ASSIGNMENT TO THE GENUS MYCOBACTERIUM AND WAS DISTINGUISHED FROM THE TYPE STRAIN OF MYCOBACTERIUM VACCAE AND FROM OTHER CLOSELY RELATED REFERENCE STRAINS ON THE BASIS OF CONCATENATED SEQUENCES OF 16S RRNA, GYRB, HSP65, RECA AND RPOB GENES. IT WAS ALSO DISTINGUISHED FROM M. VACCAE STRAIN DSM 43292 T AND FROM THE TYPE STRAIN OF MYCOBACTERIUM OBUENSE, ITS NEAREST PHYLOGENETIC NEIGHBOUR, ON THE BASIS OF CHEMOTAXONOMIC AND PHENOTYPIC DATA AND DIGITAL DNA -DNA RELATEDNESS VALUES OF 22.7 AND 68.3 %, RESPECTIVELY. THESE DATASETS NOT ONLY INDICATE THAT STRAIN NCTC 11659 T HAD BEEN MISCLASSIFIED AS M. VACCAE BUT THAT IT MERITS RECOGNITION AS REPRESENTING A NOVEL SPECIES OF THE GENUS MYCOBACTERIUM. IT IS PROPOSED THAT THE ORGANISM BE CLASSIFIED AS MYCOBACTERIUM KYOGAENSE SP. NOV. 2018 IUMS." "DESCRIPTION OF A NOVEL SPECIES OF FAST GROWING MYCOBACTERIUM: MYCOBACTERIUM KYOGAENSE SP.
