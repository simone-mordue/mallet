"1614" "THE REACTION BETWEEN IPR2 PCL AND ONE EQUIVALENT OF MEMGBR, FOLLOWED BY ONE EQUIVALENT OF BH3SME2, GIVES THE PHOSPHINE-BORANE IPR2 P(BH3)ME (4). TREATMENT OF 4 WITH NBULI, FOLLOWED BY ME3 SICL, GIVES THE STERICALLY DEMANDING PHOSPHINE-BORANE IPR2 P(BH3)(ME3 SI)CH2 (5) IN GOOD YIELD. METALATION OF 5 WITH NBULI YIELDS IPR2 P(BH3)(ME3 SI)CHLI (6), WHICH WAS CRYSTALLISED AS THE TMEDA ADDUCT [IPR2 P(BH3)(ME3 SI)CH]LI(TMEDA) (6A) AND CHARACTERISED BY X-RAY CRYSTALLOGRAPHY [TMEDA=N,N,N,N-TETRAMETHYLETHYLENEDIAMINE]. THE REACTION BETWEEN TWO EQUIVALENTS OF IN SITU-GENERATED 6 AND CP2 SN IN TOLUENE GIVES THE DIALKYLSTANNYLENE [IPR2 P(BH3)(ME3 SI)CH]2 SN (7), WHICH WAS CRYSTALLISED FROM METHYLCYCLOHEXANE/THF AS THE RAC DIASTEREOMER. X-RAY CRYSTALLOGRAPHY REVEALS THAT STABILISATION OF THE SN CENTRE IN 7 IS AFFORDED BY TWO AGOSTIC-TYPE B-HSN INTERACTIONS, ONE FROM EACH BH3 GROUP. 2014 BY DE GRUYTER 2014."
