"263" "NANOPARTICLES (NPS) ENTER THE ENVIRONMENT MAINLY THROUGH WASTE WATER EFFLUENTS, ACCIDENTAL SPILLAGE, AND INDUSTRIAL RUNOFFS. THIS IS WORRYING BECAUSE NPS CAN ENTER THE HUMAN BODY OWING TO THEIR LARGE ASPECT-TO-SIZE RATIO AND REACTIVE SURFACES THAT FACILITATE THEIR PENETRATION THROUGH BIOLOGICAL BARRIERS AND THUS CAN INDUCE OXIDATIVE STRESS IN HOST CELLS. THEREFORE, THERE IS A GROWING CONCERN ABOUT THE TOXICITY OF NPS, WHICH NEEDS TO BE ADDRESSED. THUS, THIS STUDY INVESTIGATED THE AMELIORATIVE EFFECTS OF MORINGA OLEIFERA SEED EXTRACT (MOSE) IN CYPRINUS CARPIO EXPOSED TO COPPER NANOPARTICLES (CU-NPS). FOR THE IN VIVO ASSESSMENT OF THE SHIELDING EFFECTS OF MOSE, 240 SAMPLES OF C. CARPIO (40-45 G) WERE RANDOMLY ALLOCATED TO 24 EXPERIMENTAL TANKS (10 FISH/TANK OF 40 L) 24 H PRIOR TO THE START OF THIS EXPERIMENT. THE EXPERIMENTAL FISH WERE FACED WITH THE WATER-BORN EXPOSURE OF A PRE-DETERMINED DOSE OF 1.5 MG CU-NPS/L ALONG WITH PRE- AND POST-TREATMENT WITH DIFFERENT DOSES (100 OR 200 OR 300 MG L-1) OF MOSE FOR 28 DAYS. THE MOSE SHOWED SIGNIFICANT AMELIORATIVE EFFECT ON THE ANTIOXIDANT DEFENSE, IN RESPONSE TO THE ELEVATED LEVELS OF CU-NP-INDUCED OXIDATIVE STRESS. IT ALSO PLAYED A PROTECTIVE ROLE AS INDICATED BY THE SUPPRESSION OF THE HISTOLOGICAL ALTERATIONS IN THE GILLS AND LIVER OF FISH EXPOSED TO THE CU-NPS. IT WAS CONCLUDED THAT THE CU-NP-INDUCED TOXICITY IN C. CARPIO WAS AMELIORATED BY THE USE OF MOSE IN THIS STUDY. MOREOVER, THE POST-CU-NP TREATMENT STAGE SHOWED MORE PROTECTIVE EFFECTS OF MOSE THAN THE PRE-CU-NP TREATMENT PHASE. FURTHER STUDIES ARE SUGGESTED TO DETERMINE THE OPTIMUM DOSE AND DELIVERY METHOD OF MOSE FOR SIMILAR OR DIFFERENT NP EXPOSED FISH. 2018 IOP PUBLISHING LTD."
