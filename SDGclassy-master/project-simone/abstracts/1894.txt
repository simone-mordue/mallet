"16" "WESTERN ANATOLIA IS A COMPLEX ASSEMBLAGE OF TERRANES, INCLUDING THE SAKARYA TERRANE AND THE TAURIDE-ANATOLIDE PLATFORM THAT COLLIDED DURING THE LATE CRETACEOUS AND PALAEOGENE (8025MA) AFTER THE CLOSURE OF THE IZMIR-ANKARA OCEAN. DETERMINING THE PRECISE TIMING AT WHICH THIS OCEAN CLOSED IS PARTICULARLY IMPORTANT TO TEST KINEMATIC RECONSTRUCTIONS AND GEODYNAMIC MODELS OF THE MEDITERRANEAN REGION, AND THE CHRONOLOGY OF SUTURING AND ITS MECHANISMS REMAIN CONTROVERSIAL. HERE, WE DOCUMENT THE CRETACEOUS-EOCENE SEDIMENTARY HISTORY OF THE CENTRAL SAKARYA BASIN, ALONG THE NORTHERN MARGIN OF THE NEOTETHYS OCEAN, VIA VARIOUS APPROACHES INCLUDING BIOSTRATIGRAPHY, GEOCHRONOLOGY, AND SEDIMENTOLOGY. TWO HIGH-RESOLUTION SECTIONS FROM THE CENTRAL SAKARYA BASIN SHOW THAT PELAGIC CARBONATE SEDIMENTATION SHIFTED TO RAPID SILICICLASTIC DEPOSITION IN THE EARLY CAMPANIAN (~79.6MA), INTERPRETED TO BE A RESULT OF THE BUILD-UP OF THE ACCRETIONARY PRISM AT THE SOUTHERN MARGIN OF THE SAKARYA TERRANE. RAPID ONSET OF DELTAIC PROGRADATION AND AN INCREASE IN ACCUMULATION RATES IN THE LATE DANIAN (~61MA), AS WELL AS A LOCAL ANGULAR UNCONFORMITY ARE ATTRIBUTED TO THE ONSET OF COLLISION BETWEEN THE SAKARYA TERRANE AND THE TAURIDE-ANATOLIDE PLATFORM. THUS, OUR RESULTS INDICATE THAT THOUGH DEFORMATION OF THE SUBDUCTION MARGIN IN WESTERN ANATOLIA STARTED AS EARLY AS THE CAMPANIAN, THE CLOSURE OF THE ZMIR-ANKARA OCEAN WAS ONLY ACHIEVED BY THE EARLY PALAEOCENE. 2018, 2018 INFORMA UK LIMITED, TRADING AS TAYLOR & FRANCIS GROUP."
