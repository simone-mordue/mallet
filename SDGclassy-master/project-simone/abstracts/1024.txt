"75" "POLY(ADP-RIBOSE) POLYMERASE (PARP) INHIBITORS ARE INCREASINGLY BEING STUDIED AS CANCER DRUGS, AS SINGLE AGENTS, OR AS A PART OF COMBINATION THERAPIES. IMAGING OF PARP USING A RADIOLABELED INHIBITOR HAS BEEN PROPOSED FOR PATIENT SELECTION, OUTCOME PREDICTION, DOSE OPTIMIZATION, GENOTOXIC THERAPY EVALUATION, AND TARGET ENGAGEMENT IMAGING OF NOVEL PARP-TARGETING AGENTS. METHODS: HERE, VIA THE COPPER-MEDIATED 18F-RADIOFLUORINATION OF ARYL BORONIC ESTERS, WE ACCESSED, FOR THE FIRST TIME (TO OUR KNOWLEDGE), THE 18F-RADIOLABELED ISOTOPOLOG OF THE FOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATIONAPPROVED PARP INHIBITOR OLAPARIB. THE USE OF THE 18F-LABELED EQUIVALENT OF OLAPARIB ALLOWS DIRECT PREDICTION OF THE DISTRIBUTION OF OLAPARIB, GIVEN ITS EXACT STRUCTURAL LIKENESS TO THE NATIVE, NONRADIOLABELED DRUG. RESULTS: 18F-OLAPARIB WAS TAKEN UP SELECTIVELY IN VITRO IN PARP-1EXPRESSING CELLS. IRRADIATION INCREASED PARP-1 EXPRESSION AND 18F-OLAPARIB UPTAKE IN A RADIATION-DOSEDEPENDENT FASHION. PET IMAGING IN MICE SHOWED SPECIFIC UPTAKE OF 18F-OLAPARIB IN TUMORS EXPRESSING PARP-1 (3.2% 0.36% OF THE INJECTED DOSE PER GRAM OF TISSUE IN PSN-1 XENOGRAFTS), CORRELATING LINEARLY WITH PARP-1 EXPRESSION. TWO HOURS AFTER IRRADIATION OF THE TUMOR (10 GY), UPTAKE OF 18F-OLAPARIB INCREASED BY 70% (P 5 0.025). CONCLUSION: TAKEN TOGETHER, WE SHOW THAT 18F-OLAPARIB HAS GREAT POTENTIAL FOR NONINVASIVE TUMOR IMAGING AND MONITORING OF RADIATION DAMAGE.
