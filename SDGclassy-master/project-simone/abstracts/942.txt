"110" "OIL RESERVOIR SOURING AND ASSOCIATED MATERIAL INTEGRITY CHALLENGES ARE OF GREAT CONCERN TO THE PETROLEUM INDUSTRY. THE BIOENGINEERING STRATEGY OF NITRATE INJECTION HAS PROVEN SUCCESSFUL FOR CONTROLLING SOURING IN SOME CASES, BUT RECENT REPORTS INDICATE INCREASED CORROSION IN NITRATE-TREATED PRODUCED WATER REINJECTION FACILITIES. SULFIDE-OXIDIZING, NITRATE-REDUCING BACTERIA (SONRB) HAVE BEEN SUGGESTED TO BE THE CAUSE OF SUCH CORROSION. USING THE MODEL SONRB SULFURIMONAS SP. STRAIN CVO OBTAINED FROM AN OIL FIELD, WE CONDUCTED A DETAILED ANALYSIS OF SONRB-INDUCED CORROSION AT INITIAL NITRATE-TO-SULFIDE (N/S) RATIOS RELEVANT TO OIL FIELD OPERATIONS. THE ACTIVITY OF STRAIN CVO CAUSED SEVERE CORROSION RATES OF UP TO 0.27 MILLIMETERS PER YEAR (MM Y -1 ) AND UP TO 60-M-DEEP PITTING WITHIN ONLY 9 DAYS. THE HIGHEST CORROSION DURING THE GROWTH OF STRAIN CVO WAS ASSOCIATED WITH THE PRODUCTION OF ZERO-VALENT SULFUR DURING SULFIDE OXIDATION AND THE ACCUMULATION OF NITRITE, WHEN INITIAL N/S RATIOS WERE HIGH. ABIOTIC CORROSION TESTS WITH INDIVIDUAL METABOLITES CONFIRMED BIOGENIC ZERO-VALENT SULFUR AND NITRITE AS THE MAIN CAUSES OF CORROSION UNDER THE EXPERIMENTAL CONDITIONS. MACKINAWITE (FES) DEPOSITED ON CARBON STEEL SURFACES ACCELERATED ABIOTIC REDUCTION OF BOTH SULFUR AND NITRITE, EXACERBATING CORROSION. BASED ON THESE RESULTS, A CONCEPTUAL MODEL FOR NITRATE-MEDIATED CORROSION BY SONRB IS PROPOSED. 2019 AMERICAN SOCIETY FOR MICROBIOLOGY."
