"813" "THE CATALYTIC ACTIVITY OF DNA-DEPENDENT PROTEIN KINASE (DNA-PK) IS CRITICAL TO ITS ABILITY TO REPAIR LETHAL DNA DOUBLE-STRAND BREAKS (DSBS). THIS INCLUDES REPAIR OF DSB LESIONS RESULTING FROM OXIDATIVE STRESS, ONCOGENE-INDUCED TRANSCRIPTION, OR FOLLOWING THERAPEUTIC TREATMENT OF CANCER CELLS. ARMED WITH THIS KNOWLEDGE, MANY ATTEMPTS HAVE BEEN MADE TO IDENTIFY SMALL-MOLECULE INHIBITORS OF DNA-PK ACTIVITY AS AN APPROACH TO INDUCE TUMOUR CHEMO- AND RADIOSENSITISATION. THIS REVIEW EXAMINES THE STRUCTURES OF KNOWN REVERSIBLE AND IRREVERSIBLE INHIBITORS, INCLUDING THOSE BASED ON CHROMEN-4-ONE, ARYLMORPHOLINE, AND BENZALDEHYDE SCAFFOLDS. DNA-PK CATALYTIC INHIBITORS, SUCH AS VX-984 (8-[(1S)-2-[[6-(4,6-DIDEUTERIO-2-METHYLPYRIMIDIN-5-YL)PYRIMIDIN-4-YL]AMINO]-1-METHYLETHYL]QUINOLINE-4-CARBOXAMIDE) AND M3814 ((S)-[2-CHLORO-4-FLUORO-5-(7-MORPHOLINOQUINAZOLIN-4-YL)PHENYL]-(6-METHOXYPYRIDAZIN-3-YL)METHANOL), HAVE NOW PROGRESSED INTO CLINICAL DEVELOPMENT WHICH SHOULD HELP TO FURTHER ADVANCE OUR UNDERSTANDING OF WHETHER THIS APPROACH IS A PROMISING THERAPEUTIC STRATEGY FOR THE TREATMENT OF CANCER. 2017 WILEY-VCH VERLAG GMBH & CO.
