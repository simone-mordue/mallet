"1021" "MAIN CONCLUSION: A COMBINED APPROACH, USING A CARBOHYDRATE MICROARRAY AS A SUPPORT FOR GENOMIC DATA, HAS REVEALED SUBTLE PLANT CELL-WALL REMODELLING DURINGTUBER MELANOSPORUMANDCORYLUS AVELLANAINTERACTION. CELL WALLS ARE INVOLVED, TO A GREAT EXTENT, IN MEDIATING PLANTMICROBE INTERACTIONS. AN IMPORTANT FEATURE OF THESE INTERACTIONS CONCERNS CHANGES IN THE CELL-WALL COMPOSITION DURING INTERACTION WITH OTHER ORGANISMS. IN ECTOMYCORRHIZAE, PLANT AND FUNGAL CELL WALLS COME INTO DIRECT CONTACT, AND REPRESENT THE INTERFACE BETWEEN THE TWO PARTNERS. HOWEVER, VERY LITTLE INFORMATION IS AVAILABLE ON THE RE-ARRANGEMENT THAT COULD OCCUR WITHIN THE PLANT AND FUNGAL CELL WALLS DURING ECTOMYCORRHIZAL SYMBIOSIS. TAKING ADVANTAGE OF THE COMPREHENSIVE MICROARRAY POLYMER PROFILING (COMPP) TECHNOLOGY, THE CURRENT STUDY HAS HAD THE AIM OF MONITORING THE CHANGES THAT TAKE PLACE IN THE PLANT CELL WALL IN CORYLUS AVELLANA ROOTS DURING COLONIZATION BY THE ASCOMYCETOUS ECTOMYCORRHIZAL FUNGUS T. MELANOSPORUM. ADDITIONALLY, GENES ENCODING PUTATIVE PLANT CELL-WALL DEGRADING ENZYMES (PCWDES) HAVE BEEN IDENTIFIED IN THE T. MELANOSPORUM GENOME, AND RT-QPCRS HAVE BEEN PERFORMED TO VERIFY THE EXPRESSION OF SELECTED GENES IN FULLY DEVELOPED C. AVELLANA/T. MELANOSPORUM ECTOMYCORRHIZAE. A LOCALIZED DEGRADATION OF PECTIN SEEMS TO OCCUR DURING FUNGAL COLONIZATION, IN AGREEMENT WITH THE GROWTH OF THE ECTOMYCORRHIZAL FUNGUS THROUGH THE MIDDLE LAMELLA AND WITH THE FUNGAL GENE EXPRESSION OF GENES ACTING ON THESE POLYSACCHARIDES. 2016, SPRINGER-VERLAG BERLIN HEIDELBERG."
