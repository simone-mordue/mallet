"1871" "THE FIRST RECORDING OF DROSOPHILA SUZUKII IN THE UK OCCURRED IN THE SOUTH OF ENGLAND DURING AUGUST 2012. SINCE THEN STICKY TRAPS HAVE CONTINUED TO RECORD THE PRESENCE OF INDIVIDUALS. SEVERAL PRODUCTS (BOTH CHEMICAL AND BIOLOGICAL) WERE INVESTIGATED FOR THEIR EFFICACY AGAINST DIFFERENT LIFE-STAGES OF THE PEST. BOTH DIRECT AND INDIRECT EXPOSURE TO CONTROL PRODUCTS WAS ASSESSED. SPINOSAD, CHLORANTRANILIPROLE AND THE EXPERIMENTAL PRODUCT, TA2674, SHOWED EXCELLENT POTENTIAL AS CONTROL AGENTS WHEN USED AS EITHER A PRE- OR POST-DIPPING TREATMENT FOR BLUEBERRIES WITH MORTALITIES OF 100%, 93% AND 98% MORTALITY, RESPECTIVELY, BEING ACHIEVED FOLLOWING PRE-TREATMENT. DIRECT SPRAY APPLICATION OF ALL PRODUCTS TESTED HAD LIMITED IMPACT UPON ADULT FLIES. HIGHEST MORTALITY (68%) WAS ACHIEVED FOLLOWING DIRECT APPLICATION OF TA2674. ENTOMOPATHOGENIC AGENTS (NEMATODES AND FUNGI) TESTED APPEARED TO REDUCE FLY POPULATION DEVELOPMENT (RANGES OF 34-44% MORTALITY OBTAINED) BUT WOULD SEEM UNABLE TO ERADICATE OUTBREAKS. THE POTENTIAL OF THE TESTED PRODUCTS TO CONTROL D. SUZUKII IS DISCUSSED. 2014 BY THE AUTHORS, LICENSEE MDPI, BASEL, SWITZERLAND."
