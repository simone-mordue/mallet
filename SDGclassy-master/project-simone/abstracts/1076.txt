"389" "PURPOSE AND HYPOTHESIS: CORRECT FEMORAL COMPONENT ROTATION AT KNEE ARTHROPLASTY INFLUENCES PATELLAR TRACKING AND MAY DETERMINE FUNCTION AT EXTREMES OF MOVEMENT. ADDITIONALLY, SUCH MALROTATION MAY DELETERIOUSLY INFLUENCE FLEXION/EXTENSION GAP GEOMETRY AND SOFT TISSUE BALANCING KINEMATICS. LITTLE IS KNOWN ABOUT THE EFFECT OF SUBTLE ROTATIONAL CHANGE UPON LOAD TRANSFER ACROSS THE TIBIOFEMORAL ARTICULATION. OUR NULL HYPOTHESIS WAS THAT FEMORAL COMPONENT ROTATION WOULD NOT INFLUENCE LOAD ACROSS THIS JOINT IN PREDICTABLE MANNER. METHODS: A CADAVERIC STUDY WAS PERFORMED TO EXAMINE LOAD TRANSFER USING THE ORTHOSENSOR DEVICE, RESPECTING LAXITY PATTERNS IN 6 OF MOTION, TO EXAMINE LOAD ACROSS THE MEDIAL AND LATERAL COMPARTMENTS ACROSS A FULL ARC OF MOTION. MIXED-EFFECTMODELLING ALLOWED FOR QUANTIFICATION OF THE EFFECT UPON LOAD WITH INTERNAL AND EXTERNAL FEMORAL COMPONENT ROTATION IN RELATION TO A DATUM IN A MODERN SINGLE-RADIUS CRUCIATE-RETAINING PRIMARY KNEE DESIGN. RESULTS: NO SIGNIFICANT CHANGE IN MAXIMAL LAXITY WAS FOUND BETWEEN DIFFERENT FEMORAL ROTATIONAL STATES. INTERNAL ROTATION OF THE FEMORAL COMPONENT RESULTED IN SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN MEDIAL COMPARTMENT LOAD TRANSFER FOR KNEE FLEXION INCLUDING AND BEYOND 60. EXTERNAL ROTATION OF THE FEMORAL COMPONENT WITHIN THE LIMITS STUDIED DID NOT INFLUENCE TIBIOFEMORAL LOAD TRANSFER. CONCLUSIONS: INTERNAL ROTATION OF THE FEMORAL COMPONENT WILL ADVERSELY INFLUENCE MEDIAL COMPARTMENT LOAD TRANSFER AND COULD LEAD TO PREMATURE POLYETHYLENE WEAR ON THE MEDIAL SIDE. 2017, THE AUTHOR(S)."
