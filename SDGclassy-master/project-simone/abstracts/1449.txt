"1791" "THE IMPACT OF MODIFIED MONTMORILLONITES ON ADSORPTION AND BIODEGRADATION OF CRUDE OIL C1-PHENANTHRENES, C1-DIBENZOTHIOPHENES, C2-PHENANTHRENES AND C2-DIBENZOTHIOPHENES WAS INVESTIGATED IN AQUEOUS CLAY/OIL MICROCOSM EXPERIMENTS WITH A HYDROCARBON DEGRADING MICROORGANISM COMMUNITY. CONSEQUENTLY, THE EFFECT ON C1-DIBENZOTHIOPHENES/C1-PHENANTHRENES, C2-DIBENZOTHIOPHENES/C2-PHENANTHRENES, 2+3-METHYLDIBENZOTHIOPHENE/4-METHYLDIBENZOTHIOPHENE AND 1-METHYLDIBENZOTHIOPHENE/4-METHYLDIBENZOTHIOPHENE RATIOS COMMONLY USED AS DIAGNOSTIC RATIOS FOR OIL FORENSIC STUDIES WAS EVALUATED. THE CLAY MINERAL SAMPLES WERE TREATED TO PRODUCE ACID ACTIVATED MONTMORILLONITE, ORGANOMONTMORILLONITE AND HOMOIONIC MONTMORILLONITE WHICH WERE USED IN THIS STUDY. THE DIFFERENT CLAY MINERALS (MODIFIED AND UNMODIFIED) SHOWED VARIED DEGREES OF BIODEGRADATION AND ADSORPTION OF THE C1-PHENANTHRENES, C1-DIBENZOTHIOPHENES, C2-PHENANTHRENES AND C2-DIBENZOTHIOPHENES. THE STUDY INDICATED THAT AS OPPOSED TO BIODEGRADATION, ADSORPTION HAS NO EFFECT ON THE DIAGNOSTIC RATIOS. AMONG THE DIAGNOSTIC RATIOS REVIEWED, ONLY C2-DIBENZOTHIOPHENES/C2-PHENANTHRENES RATIO WAS NEITHER AFFECTED BY ADSORPTION NOR BIODEGRADATION MAKING THIS RATIO VERY USEFUL IN FORENSIC STUDIES OF OIL SPILLS AND OIL-OIL CORRELATION. 2013 SPRINGER SCIENCE+BUSINESS MEDIA DORDRECHT."
