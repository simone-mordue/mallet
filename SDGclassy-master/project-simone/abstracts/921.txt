"34" "NOVEL TERTIARY PHOSPHINES RPR2 WITH ADDITIONAL FUNCTIONALITIES IN THE SUBSTITUENT R HAVE BEEN DESIGNED AND PREPARED ACCORDING TO LITERATURE PROCEDURES. THE COORDINATION BEHAVIOR OF THE ADDITIONAL FUNCTIONALITY IN THE ORGANIC MOIETY AND THE PHOSPHORUS ATOM TOWARDS DIFFERENT CU(I) SALTS WAS INVESTIGATED. THESE REACTIONS RESULTED IN POLYNUCLEAR COMPLEXES WITH UNEXPECTED STRUCTURES INVOLVING CU(I) ATOMS WITH DIFFERENT COORDINATION NUMBERS IN THE SAME COMPOUND. 2018, 2018 TAYLOR & FRANCIS GROUP, LLC."
