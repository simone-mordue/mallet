"1310" "A GRAM-STAIN POSITIVE ACTINOBACTERIAL STRAIN, DESIGNATED KT1403T, WAS ISOLATED FROM A SOIL SAMPLE, COLLECTED FROM KARPAZ, MAGUSA, NORTHERN CYPRUS, AND CHARACTERISED USING A POLYPHASIC APPROACH. MORPHOLOGICAL CHARACTERISTICS AND CHEMOTAXONOMIC DATA INDICATED THAT THE STRAIN BELONGS TO THE GENUS PHYTOMONOSPORA. THE CELL WALL OF THE NOVEL STRAIN CONTAINED MESO-DIAMINOPIMELIC ACID AND GALACTOSE, GLUCOSE AND MANNOSE AS THE MAJOR SUGARS IN WHOLE CELL HYDROLYSATES. THE POLAR LIPIDS IN THE CELL MEMBRANE WERE IDENTIFIED AS DIPHOSPHATIDYLGLYCEROL, PHOSPHATIDYLGLYCEROL, PHOSPHATIDYLETHANOLAMINE, PHOSPHATIDYLINOSITOL, AN UNIDENTIFIED AMINOPHOSPHOLIPID AND THREE UNIDENTIFIED GLYCOLIPIDS. THE PREDOMINANT MENAQUINONES WERE MK-10(H6) AND MK-10(H4). THE MAJOR FATTY ACIDS WERE FOUND TO BE ISO C15:0, ANTEISO C15:0 AND ANTEISO C17:0. PHYLOGENETIC ANALYSIS BASED ON 16S RRNA GENE SEQUENCES SHOWED THAT STRAIN KT1403T BELONGS TO THE GENUS PHYTOMONOSPORA WITH A SEQUENCE SIMILARITY OF 99.73% WITH PHYTOMONOSPORAENDOPHYTICA, THE TYPE SPECIES OF THE GENUS. DNADNA HYBRIDIZATION FURTHER DIFFERENTIATED STRAIN KT1403T FROM ITS NEAR PHYLOGENETIC NEIGHBOUR, P. ENDOPHYTICA DSM 45386T (29.02.2% DNA RELATEDNESS). THEREFORE, IT IS PROPOSED THAT STRAIN KT1403T REPRESENTS A NOVEL SPECIES OF THE GENUS PHYTOMONOSPORA, FOR WHICH THE NAME PHYTOMONOSPORACYPRIA SP. NOV. IS PROPOSED. THE TYPE STRAIN IS KT1403T (=KCTC 29479T=DSM 46767T). 2015, SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING SWITZERLAND." "PHYTOMONOSPORA CYPRIA SP.
