"78" "THIS INVESTIGATION AIMED TO EVALUATE THE FEASIBILITY OF POTATO PROCESSING WASTE (PPW) AS A CO-SUBSTRATE FOR CHLORELLA VULGARIS IN BATCH BIOCHEMICAL METHANE POTENTIAL (BMP) TESTS. THREE PARAMETERS WERE EXAMINED: C. VULGARIS AND PPW MIXING RATIOS (100:0, 75:25, 50:50, 25:75 AND 0:100), PPW TYPE (POTATO DISCARDED PARTS (PPW DP ) AND POTATO PEEL (PPW P )), AND SUBSTRATE TO INOCULUM RATIO (0.5 AND 1.0 SIRS). THE MIXING RATIO WAS A SIGNIFICANT FACTOR WITH HIGHER METHANE YIELDS OBTAINED WITH 25:75 C. VULGARIS: PPW. THE TYPE OF PPW ALSO AFFECTED METHANE YIELD, AS C. VULGARIS CO-DIGESTED WITH PPW DP INCREASED METHANE YIELD BY 2247%, VERSUS A 1232% ENHANCEMENT WITH PPW P . MOREOVER, A SIR OF 1.0 LED TO AN ACCUMULATION OF SOLUBLE COD, RESULTING IN DECREASED METHANE YIELD RELATIVE TO A SIR OF 0.5. OVERALL, THE CURRENT STUDY SHOWED THAT PPW ARE SUITABLE FEEDSTOCKS FOR CO-DIGESTION WITH MICROALGAE, WITH THE ENHANCED METHANE YIELDS ATTRIBUTED TO A BALANCE C/N RATIO. HOWEVER, THE EXTRA NITROGEN IN THE SEED INOCULUM OF THE BMP TEST MAY HAVE OBSCURED THE FULL BENEFITS AND HIDDEN SOME SYNERGISTIC EFFECTS. THEREFORE, THE FOLLOW-UP STUDIES SHOULD BE CARRIED OUT IN CONTINUOUS ANAEROBIC DIGESTERS TO VERIFY THE FULL POTENTIAL OF PPW AS CO-DIGESTION SUBSTRATE FOR MICROALGAE. 2018 ELSEVIER B.V."
