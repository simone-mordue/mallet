"494" "PLANTS CONTAIN LARGE NUMBERS OF FAMILY 1 UDP-GLUCOSE-DEPENDENT GLYCOSYLTRANSFERASES (UGTS), INCLUDING MEMBERS THAT CONJUGATE XENOBIOTICS. ARABIDOPSIS CONTAINS 107 UGT GENES WITH 99 FAMILY MEMBERS SUCCESSFULLY EXPRESSED AS GLUTATHIONE TRANSFERASE (GST)-FUSION PROTEINS IN E.COLI. A HIGH-THROUGHPUT CATALYTIC SCREEN WAS DEVELOPED BASED ON QUANTIFICATION OF THE FUSION BY MEASURING GST ACTIVITY. UGT ACTIVITY USING UDP-GLUCOSE AS DONOR WAS THEN DETERMINED USING 11 SYNTHETIC ACCEPTORS BEARING HYDROXYL, AMINO AND THIOL GROUPS THAT HAD BEEN SHOWN TO UNDERGO CONJUGATION IN PLANT EXTRACTS. IN TOTAL, 44 UGTS, LARGELY MEMBERS OF THE D AND E GROUPS, WERE ACTIVE TOWARDS XENOBIOTICS, GLUCOSYLATING PHENOL AND THIOL ACCEPTORS. IN CONTRAST, N-GLUCOSYLTRANSFERASE (NGT) ACTIVITY WAS ALMOST EXCLUSIVELY RESTRICTED TO A SINGLE ENZYME, UGT72B1. USING DNA MICROARRAYS, THE INDUCTION OF UGT TRANSCRIPTS FOLLOWING TREATMENT WITH THE HERBICIDE SAFENER FENCLORIM WAS COMPARED IN ARABIDOPSIS AND RICE. D AND L GROUP MEMBERS WERE THE MOST SAFENER-INDUCIBLE UGTS IN BOTH SPECIES. THE RESPECTIVE ARABIDOPSIS ENZYMES SHOWED LOW CONJUGATING ACTIVITY TOWARDS XENOBIOTICS. USING GENEVESTIGATOR, A SMALL GROUP OF SAFENED D AND L UGTS WERE CONSISTENTLY INDUCED IN RESPONSE TO BIOTIC AND ABIOTIC STRESS SUGGESTIVE OF PROTECTIVE ACTIVITIES BEYOND XENOBIOTIC DETOXIFICATION IN BOTH SPECIES. THE INDUCTION OF OTHER DETOXIFYING GENE FAMILIES FOLLOWING TREATMENT WITH FENCLORIM, NAMELY CYTOCHROMES P450 AND GLUTATHIONE TRANSFERASES, FURTHER CONFIRMED THE SELECTIVE ENHANCEMENT OF RELATED SUBFAMILY MEMBERS IN THE TWO SPECIES GIVING NEW INSIGHT INTO THE SAFENING RESPONSE IN CEREALS, WHERE HERBICIDE TOLERANCE IS ENHANCED COMPARED WITH DICOTS, WHICH ARE UNRESPONSIVE TO THESE TREATMENTS. 2017 THE AUTHORS.
