"472" "THE OTTERBURN PUBLIC INQUIRY (1997 AND 1999) POLARIZED OPINION AS TO HOW ENGLANDS FINEST COUNTRYSIDE SHOULD BEST BE UTILIZED. ON THE ONE HAND, THE MINISTRY OF DEFENCE SOUGHT TO REALIZE A MAJOR DEVELOPMENT IN A PROTECTED AREA, WHEREAS ON THE OTHER, NORTHUMBERLAND COUNTY COUNCIL AND NORTHUMBERLAND NATIONAL PARK AUTHORITY OPPOSED THE PLANS, ARGUING THAT CONSERVATION AND RECREATION SHOULD TAKE PRIORITY. THIS STUDY WAS UNDERTAKEN SEVERAL YEARS LATER AND TOOK A RETROSPECTIVE LOOK AT THE SAGA THROUGH A RECOLLECTION OF PERSONAL ACCOUNTS, SO AS TO EXAMINE THE IMPACT AND LEGACY THAT WAS BORNE OUT OF THIS DEVELOPMENT. SEMI-STRUCTURED INTERVIEWS WERE UNDERTAKEN WITH A NUMBER OF STAKEHOLDERS AS PART OF A WIDER PROJECT ON PARTNERSHIP WORKING. IT WAS FOUND THAT THE MINISTRY OF DEFENCE USED THIS PLANNING DISPUTE TO AFFIRM THAT DEFENCE OF THE REALM WAS A GREATER NATIONAL INTEREST THAN ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION. THE OUTCOME OF THE PUBLIC INQUIRY WAS ALSO FOUND TO CONTRIBUTE TOWARDS A RADICAL CHANGE IN THE WAY NORTHUMBERLAND NATIONAL PARK WAS MANAGED. THE UNIVERSITY OF LEEDS, 2018."
