"841" "DIMETHYLSULPHIDE (DMS) PHOTO-OXIDATION AND DIMETHYLSULPHOXIDE (DMSO) PHOTOPRODUCTION WERE ESTIMATED IN 26 LABORATORY IRRADIATIONS OF COASTAL SAMPLES FROM NE ENGLAND (TYNE ESTUARY) AND W SCOTLAND (LOCH LINNHE AND RIVER NANT AT TAYNUILT). PSEUDO-FIRST ORDER RATE CONSTANTS OF DMS PHOTO-OXIDATION (0.038 H 1 TO 0.345 H 1 ) AND DMSO PHOTO-PRODUCTION (0.017 H 1 TO 0.283 H 1 ) VARIED BY ONE ORDER OF MAGNITUDE AND WERE LOWEST IN THE COASTAL NORTH SEA. ESTUARINE SAMPLES (SALINITY S &LT, 30) HAD A MEAN DMSO YIELD OF 96 16% (N=14), CONSISTENT WITH 1:1 M CONVERSION VIA PHOTOSENSITISED OXIDATION BY SINGLET OXYGEN. PHOTOCHEMICAL RATE CONSTANTS WERE STRONGLY CORRELATED WITH COLOURED DISSOLVED ORGANIC MATTER (CDOM) ABSORPTION COEFFICIENTS AT 350 NM, A 350 . VARIATIONS IN A 350 EXPLAINED 61% (R 2=0.61, N=26) AND 73% (R 2=0.73, N=17) OF THE VARIABILITY IN DMS PHOTO-OXIDATION AND DMSO PRODUCTION, RESPECTIVELY. HOWEVER, CDOM NORMALISED PHOTOCHEMICAL RATE CONSTANTS INCREASED STRONGLY TOWARDS COASTAL WATERS EXHIBITING LOWEST CDOM ABSORBANCE, INDICATING WATER SAMPLES OF MARINE CHARACTER (S &GT, 30) TO BE MOST REACTIVE WITH RESPECT TO DMS PHOTO-OXIDATION. ESTIMATES OF WATER COLUMN AVERAGED DMS PHOTO-OXIDATION RATE CONSTANTS, OBTAINED BY SCALING TO MEAN DAILY IRRADIANCE (JULY, NE ENGLAND) AND MID-UV UNDERWATER IRRADIANCE, WERE 0.012 D 1 , 0.019 D 1 , AND 0.017 D 1 FOR UPPER ESTUARY (S &LT, 20), LOWER ESTUARY (20 &LT, S &LT, 30) AND COASTAL WATERS (S &GT, 30), AT THE LOWER END OF PREVIOUS OBSERVATIONS. COMPARING OUR WATER COLUMN AVERAGED DMS PHOTO-OXIDATION RATE CONSTANTS WITH ESTIMATED DMS LOSSES VIA AIR-SEA GAS EXCHANGE AND PREVIOUSLY REPORTED BIOLOGICAL CONSUMPTION IMPLIES THAT DMS PHOTOCHEMICAL REMOVAL IS OF ONLY MINOR IMPORTANCE IN OUR STUDY AREA. 2017" "PHOTOCHEMICAL OXIDATION OF DIMETHYLSULPHIDE TO DIMETHYLSULPHOXIDE IN ESTUARINE AND COASTAL WATERS" "COLOURED DISSOLVED ORGANIC MATTER; NORTH SEA; PHOTOCHEMISTRY; REDUCED SULFUR COMPOUNDS; SEAWATER; TYNE ESTUARY"
