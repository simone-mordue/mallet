"609" "THE GREY SQUIRREL IS AN INVASIVE PEST SPECIES IN THE UNITED KINGDOM AND POPULATIONS ARE CONTROLLED TO PROTECT TIMBER CROPS AND NATIVE FAUNA. ALTHOUGH ANIMALS ARE CULLED USING A VARIETY OF METHODS, THERE ARE FEW DATA AVAILABLE ON THE RELATIVE EFFICIENCY OF DIFFERENT TRAP DESIGNS, AND IN PARTICULAR SPRING TRAPS. WE COMPARED GREY SQUIRREL CAPTURES IN MAGNUM 116 SPRING-TRAPS SET WITHIN FINEREN BOXES AGAINST CAPTURES IN A SINGLE ENTRY LIVE CAPTURE TRAP DESIGN. TRAPPING WAS CONDUCTED IN MATURE MIXED WOODLAND IN NORTH WALES. NO SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE IN THE FREQUENCY OF GREY SQUIRREL CAPTURES OR BODY MASS OF TRAPPED INDIVIDUALS BETWEEN TRAP DESIGNS WAS OBSERVED. DESPITE THE FINEREN BOX DESIGN LIMITING ACCESS BY NON-TARGET SPECIES, BY-CATCH WAS RECORDED. WE MAKE RECOMMENDATIONS FOR FUTURE RESEARCH TO MINIMISE THIS AND ALSO COMPARE OUR RESULTS FOR MAGNUM 116 TRAPS WITH DATA AVAILABLE ON CAPTURES IN FENN IV SPRING TRAPS. THE FINDINGS HAVE BROAD RELEVANCE TO THE CONTROL OF GREY SQUIRRELS ACROSS THEIR WIDER INTERNATIONAL INVASIVE RANGE. 2016 INFORMA UK LIMITED, TRADING AS TAYLOR & FRANCIS GROUP."
