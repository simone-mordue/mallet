"941" "A NOVEL ACTINOBACTERIAL STRAIN, DESIGNATED DS3010T, WAS ISOLATED FROM A BLACK SEA MARINE SEDIMENT AND CHARACTERIZED USING A POLYPHASIC APPROACH. THE STRAIN WAS SHOWN TO HAVE CHEMOTAXONOMIC, MORPHOLOGICAL AND PHYLOGENETIC PROPERTIES CONSISTENT WITH CLASSIFICATION AS REPRESENTING A MEMBER OF THE GENUS MICROMONOSPORA. COMPARATIVE 16S RRNA GENE SEQUENCE STUDIES SHOWED THAT THE STRAIN WAS MOST CLOSELY RELATED TO THE TYPE STRAINS OF MICROMONOSPORA SAELICESENSIS (99.5 %), MICROMONOSPORA CHOKORIENSIS (99.4 %) AND MICROMONOSPORA VIOLAE (99.3 %). SIMILARLY, A CORRESPONDING ANALYSIS BASED ON PARTIAL GYRB GENE SEQUENCES SHOWED THAT IT FORMED A DISTINCT PHYLETIC BRANCH IN A SUBCLADE THAT INCLUDED THE TYPE STRAINS OF MICROMONOSPORAZAMORENSIS, MICROMONOSPORA ZEAE, MICROMONOSPORA JINLONGENSIS, M. SAELICESENSIS AND MICROMONOSPORA LUPINI. DS3010T WAS DISTINGUISHED FROM ITS CLOSEST PHYLOGENETIC NEIGHBOURS BY LOW LEVELS OF DNADNA RELATEDNESS AND BY A COMBINATION OF CHEMOTAXONOMIC AND PHENOTYPIC PROPERTIES. ON THE BASIS OF THESE DATA, IT IS PROPOSED THAT THE ISOLATE SHOULD BE ASSIGNED TO THE GENUS MICROMONOSPORA AS MICROMONOSPORA PROFUNDI SP. NOV. WITH ISOLATE DS3010T (=DSM 45981T=KCTC 29243T) AS THE TYPE STRAIN. 2016 IUMS." "MICROMONOSPORA PROFUNDI SP.
