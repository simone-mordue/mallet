"666" "A NOVEL PRETARGETED SPECT IMAGING STRATEGY BASED ON THE HALOTAG ENZYME HAS BEEN EVALUATED FOR THE FIRST TIME IN A LIVING SYSTEM. TO DETERMINE THE EFFICACY OF THIS APPROACH, TWO CLINICALLY RELEVANT CANCER BIOMARKERS, HER2 AND TAG-72, WERE SELECTED TO REPRESENT MODELS OF INTERNALIZING AND NONINTERNALIZING ANTIGENS, RESPECTIVELY. IN MDA-MB-231/H2N (HER2-EXPRESSING) AND LS174T (TAG-72-EXPRESSING) XENOGRAFT TUMORS IN MICE, PRETARGETING EXPERIMENTS WERE PERFORMED IN WHICH HALOTAG-CONJUGATED DERIVATIVES OF THE ANTIBODIES TRASTUZUMAB (ANTI-HER2) OR CC49 (ANTI-TAG-72) WERE UTILIZED AS PRIMARY AGENTS, AND THE SMALL MOLECULE HALOTAG LIGANDS 111 IN-HTL-1, -2, AND -3 WERE EVALUATED AS SECONDARY AGENTS. WHILE THIS APPROACH WAS NOT SUFFICIENTLY SENSITIVE TO DETECT THE INTERNALIZING HER2 ANTIGEN, PRETARGETING EXPERIMENTS INVOLVING THE MOST OPTIMAL SECONDARY AGENT, 111 IN-HTL-3, WERE SUCCESSFUL IN DETECTING THE NONINTERNALIZING ANTIGEN TAG-72 AND PROVIDED HIGH-CONTRAST SPECT IMAGES AT 4 AND 24 H POSTINJECTION. 2017 AMERICAN CHEMICAL SOCIETY."
