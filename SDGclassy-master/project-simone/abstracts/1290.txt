"1314" "THE ADVENT OF X-RAY FREE ELECTRON LASERS IS PROVIDING NEW OPPORTUNITIES FOR PROBING THE ULTRAFAST EXCITED STATE DYNAMICS USING STRUCTURALLY SENSITIVE TECHNIQUES. HEREIN WE USE EXCITED STATE WAVEPACKET DYNAMICS OF A PROTOTYPICAL CU(I)-PHENANTHROLINE COMPLEX, [CU(DMP)2]+ (DMP=2, 9-DIMETHYL-1, 10-PHENANTHROLINE) TO INVESTIGATE HOW FEMTOSECOND VIBRATIONAL AND ELECTRONIC RELAXATION IS TRANSLATED INTO TRANSIENT X-RAY ABSORPTION AND EMISSION. USING REALISTIC EXPERIMENTAL PARAMETERS WE ALSO DERIVE THE ANTICIPATED SIGNAL STRENGTHS FOR THESE TRANSIENT FEATURES. THIS INDICATES THAT ALTHOUGH RECORDING A SIGNAL CAPTURING THE STRONGEST TRANSIENT (I.E. EXCITED STATE-GROUND STATE) CHANGES WILL BE POSSIBLE FOR ALL CASES, ONLY WITH X-RAY ABSORPTION NEAR-EDGE STRUCTURE AND EXTENDED X-RAY ABSORPTION FINE STRUCTURE WILL IT BE POSSIBLE TO RESOLVE THE FINE DETAILS ASSOCIATED WITH THE WAVEPACKET DYNAMICS WITHIN REALISTIC EXPERIMENTAL ACQUISITION TIMES. 2015 IOP PUBLISHING LTD."
