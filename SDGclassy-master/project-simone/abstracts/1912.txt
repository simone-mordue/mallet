IN RECOGNITION OF POTENTIAL DEVELOPMENT, AN INTERNATIONAL SYMPOSIUM, MARINE BIOTECHNOLOGYEMERGING OPPORTUNITIES AND FUTURE PERSPECTIVES, WAS HELD IN MUSCAT, NOVEMBER 1213, 2013. THREE KEYNOTE ADDRESSES WERE GIVEN, 23 ORAL PRESENTATIONS MADE, AND A POSTER EXHIBITION HELD. THE FINAL SESSION REVIEWED NATIONAL AND REGIONAL ISSUES, AND THE DELEGATES AGREED INFORMALLY ON A NUMBER OF FUTURE ACTIONS. THE POTENTIAL FOR FUTURE DEVELOPMENT OF MARINE BIOTECHNOLOGY WAS RECOGNIZED BY ALL DELEGATES, AND FOLLOWING THE SYMPOSIUM, THEY WERE SURVEYED FOR THEIR VIEWS ON HOW BEST TO SUSTAIN AND DEVELOP NEW ACTIVITIES. ONE HUNDRED PERCENT OF RESPONDENTS FOUND THE MEETING USEFUL AND WOULD SUPPORT FUTURE SYMPOSIA IN THE REGION. FIFTY-ONE PERCENT OF OMANI RESPONDENTS RECOGNIZED MAJOR ORGANIZATIONAL CHALLENGES AND OBSTACLES TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF MARINE BIOTECHNOLOGY COMPARED WITH 23% OF OVERSEAS RESPONDENTS. THE NEED FOR GREATER COLLABORATION BETWEEN RESEARCH INSTITUTIONS WITHIN THE GCC REGION WAS RECOGNIZED BY 98% OF ALL RESPONDENTS. THE PRESENTATIONS AND SURVEY OUTCOMES ARE REVIEWED IN THIS PAPER. 2015, SPRINGER SCIENCE+BUSINESS MEDIA NEW YORK."
