"1355" "ABSTRACT EPOXIDES ARE USEFUL PRECURSORS FOR THE SYNTHESIS OF HYDROXYL-BEARING BUILDING BLOCKS VIA LEWIS ACID CATALYZED, NUCLEOPHILIC RING OPENING. HOWEVER, THE REACTION OF GLYCIDATE ESTERS WITH ALCOHOL NUCLEOPHILES CAN BE QUITE CHALLENGING WITH MANY OF THE CLASSICAL PARADIGMS FOR EPOXIDE OPENING FAILING TO GIVE EFFICIENT REACTION. IN OUR HANDS, THE MOST EFFICIENT CATALYST DESCRIBED IN THE LITERATURE FOR EFFECTING THIS TRANSFORMATION WAS MAGNESIUM PERCHLORATE. HOWEVER, RING OPENING OF METHYL GLYCIDATE WITH THIS CATALYST REVEALED THE POTENTIAL FOR RAPID AND UNCONTROLLABLE DECOMPOSITION WITH ONSET AT A RELATIVELY LOW TEMPERATURE. HEREIN, THE DEVELOPMENT OF AN ALTERNATIVE PROCESS, WHICH IS SAFE AND SCALABLE, IS DESCRIBED. THIS ALLOWED THE SYNTHESIS OF A SERIES OF NOVEL 2-HYDROXY-3-ALKOXYPROPIONATES. 2015 ELSEVIER LTD."
