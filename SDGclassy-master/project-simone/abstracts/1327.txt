"503" "THE BIOLOGICAL CONVERSION OF LIGNOCELLULOSIC MATTER INTO HIGH-VALUE CHEMICALS OR BIOFUELS IS OF INCREASING INDUSTRIAL IMPORTANCE AS THE SECTOR SLOWLY TRANSITIONS AWAY FROM NONRENEWABLE SOURCES. MANY INDUSTRIAL PROCESSES INVOLVE THE USE OF CELLULOLYTIC ENZYME COCKTAILS - A SELECTION OF GLYCOSIDE HYDROLASES AND, INCREASINGLY, POLYSACCHARIDE OXYGENASES - TO BREAK DOWN RECALCITRANT PLANT POLYSACCHARIDES. ORFS FROM THE GENOME OF TEREDINIBACTER TURNERAE, A SYMBIONT HOSTED WITHIN THE GILLS OF MARINE SHIPWORMS, WERE IDENTIFIED IN ORDER TO SEARCH FOR ENZYMES WITH DESIRABLE TRAITS. HERE, A PUTATIVE T. TURNERAE GLYCOSIDE HYDROLASE FROM FAMILY 8, HEREAFTER REFERRED TO AS TTGH8, IS ANALYSED. THE ENZYME IS SHOWN TO BE ACTIVE AGAINST -1,4-XYLAN AND MIXED-LINKAGE (-1,3,-1,4) MARINE XYLAN. KINETIC PARAMETERS, OBTAINED USING HIGH-PERFORMANCE ANIONEXCHANGE CHROMATOGRAPHY WITH PULSED AMPEROMETRIC DETECTION AND 3,5-DINITROSALICYCLIC ACID REDUCING-SUGAR ASSAYS, SHOW THAT TTGH8 CATALYSES THE HYDROLYSIS OF -1,4-XYLOHEXAOSE WITH A KCAT/KM OF 7.5 107 M-1 MIN-1 BUT DISPLAYS MAXIMAL ACTIVITY AGAINST MIXED-LINKAGE POLYMERIC XYLANS, HINTING AT A PRIMARY ROLE IN THE DEGRADATION OF MARINE POLYSACCHARIDES. THE THREE-DIMENSIONAL STRUCTURE OF TTGH8 WAS SOLVED IN UNCOMPLEXED AND XYLOBIOSE-, XYLOTRIOSE- AND XYLOHEXAOSE-BOUND FORMS AT APPROXIMATELY 1.5 RESOLUTION, THE LATTER WAS CONSISTENT WITH THE GREATER KCAT/KM FOR HEXASACCHARIDE SUBSTRATES. A2,5B BOAT CONFORMATION OBSERVED IN THE _1 POSITION OF BOUND XYLOTRIOSE IS CONSISTENT WITH THE PROPOSED CONFORMATIONAL ITINERARY FOR THIS CLASS OF ENZYME. THIS WORK SHOWS TTGH8 TO BE EFFECTIVE AT THE DEGRADATION OF XYLAN-BASED SUBSTRATES, NOTABLY MARINE XYLAN, FURTHER EXEMPLIFYING THE POTENTIAL OF T. TURNERAE FOR EFFECTIVE AND DIVERSE BIOMASS DEGRADATION. 2018 INTERNATIONAL UNION OF CRYSTALLOGRAPHY."
