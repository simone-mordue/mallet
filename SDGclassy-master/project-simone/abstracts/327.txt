"1523" "BIODIVERSITY DECLINES IN SOUTHEAST ASIA HAVE LED TO PREDICTIONS THAT MANY VERTEBRATE SPECIES WILL BECOME EXTINCT WITHIN 50 YEARS. EXAMPLES OF QUANTIFIED DETERIORATION IN SPECIES STATUS REMAIN SCARCE, HOWEVER. THE SOUTHEAST ASIAN GEOGRAPHICAL RANGE OF THE ENDANGERED GREEN PEAFOWL IS STILL CONTRACTING DUE TO HUNTING PRESSURE AND HABITAT DISTURBANCE. IN VIETNAM, THE MAIN POPULATION LIES IN THE SOUTHCENTRAL REGION WITH A RELATIVELY HIGH DENSITY REPORTED IN 1998. THE AIM OF THIS STUDY WAS TO ASSESS THE SPECIES' CURRENT STATUS IN YOK DON AND CAT TIEN NATIONAL PARKS, WHICH ARE THOUGHT TO CONTAIN THE MOST IMPORTANT VIETNAMESE POPULATIONS. WE USED LINE AND POINT TRANSECTS TO INVESTIGATE THE DENSITY AND ANALYZE HABITAT SELECTION AND EFFECTS OF HUMAN ACTIVITY. THE YOK DON POPULATION HAS DECREASED SHARPLY DURING THE PAST 15 YEARS, WHILE IN CAT TIEN, THE ESTIMATED DENSITY WAS HIGHER. ANIMALS WERE MOST NUMEROUS CLOSE TO WATER SOURCES AND LOWEST WHERE CATTLE NUMBERS WERE HIGHEST AND GROUND VEGETATION COVER ABSENT. HERE WE DOCUMENT A SIGNIFICANT NEGATIVE POPULATION CHANGE IN A PREVIOUSLY WIDESPREAD VERTEBRATE SPECIES. ALTHOUGH COMPARISONS OF POPULATION DATA OVER LONG PERIODS ARE RARE, WE DEMONSTRATE THAT TAKING ADVANTAGE OF OPPORTUNITIES TO RESURVEY SPECIES CAN QUANTIFY POPULATION DECLINES. 2014 THE AUTHORS."
