"1252" "NON-GENOTOXIC REACTIVATION OF THE P53 PATHWAY BY MDM2-P53 BINDING ANTAGONISTS IS AN ATTRACTIVE TREATMENT STRATEGY FOR WILD-TYPE TP53 CANCERS. TO DETERMINE HOW RESISTANCE TO MDM2/P53 BINDING ANTAGONISTS MIGHT DEVELOP, SJSA-1 AND NGP CELLS WERE EXPOSED TO GROWTH INHIBITORY CONCENTRATIONS OF CHEMICALLY DISTINCT MDM2 INHIBITORS, NUTLIN-3 AND MI-63, AND CLONAL RESISTANT CELL LINES GENERATED. THE P53 MEDIATED RESPONSES OF PARENTAL AND RESISTANT CELL LINES WERE COMPARED. IN CONTRAST TO THE PARENTAL CELL LINES, P53 ACTIVATION BY NUTLIN-3, MI-63 OR IONIZING RADIATION WAS NOT OBSERVED IN EITHER THE SJSA-1 OR THE NGP DERIVED CELL LINES. AN IDENTICAL TP53 MUTATION WAS SUBSEQUENTLY IDENTIFIED IN BOTH OF THE SJSA-1 RESISTANT LINES, WHILST ONE OUT OF THREE IDENTIFIED MUTATIONS WAS COMMON TO BOTH NGP DERIVED LINES. MUTATION SPECIFIC PCR REVEALED THESE MUTATIONS WERE PRESENT IN PARENTAL SJSA-1 AND NGP CELL POPULATIONS AT A LOW FREQUENCY. DESPITE CROSS-RESISTANCE TO A BROAD PANEL OF MDM2/P53 BINDING ANTAGONISTS, THESE MDM2-AMPLIFIED AND TP53 MUTANT CELL LINES REMAINED SENSITIVE TO IONIZING RADIATION (IR). THESE RESULTS INDICATE THAT MDM2/ P53 BINDING ANTAGONISTS WILL SELECT FOR P53 MUTATIONS PRESENT IN TUMOURS AT A LOW FREQUENCY AT DIAGNOSIS, LEADING TO RESISTANCE, BUT SUCH TUMOURS MAY NEVERTHELESS REMAIN RESPONSIVE TO ALTERNATIVE THERAPIES, INCLUDING IR."
