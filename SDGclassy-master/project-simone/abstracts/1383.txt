"1434" "THE EFFECT OF BUBBLE SIZE AND RISE VELOCITY ON THE EFFICIENCY OF A FOAM FLOTATION MICROALGAE HARVESTING UNIT WAS DETERMINED. THREE SPARGER AND INPUT AIRFLOW COMBINATIONS WERE USED: (1) LIMEWOOD SPARGER WITH CONSTANT AIRFLOW, (2) CERAMIC FLAT PLATE SPARGER WITH CONSTANT AIRFLOW AND (3) CERAMIC FLAT PLATE SPARGER WITH AN OSCILLATING AIRFLOW. THE CERAMIC SPARGER WITH OSCILLATING FLOW GENERATED THE SMALLEST BUBBLES WITHIN THE LIQUID POOL AND THE LARGEST BUBBLES WITHIN THE FOAM PHASE. THIS DELIVERED THE HIGHEST LEVELS OF BIOMASS RECOVERY DUE TO ENHANCED BUBBLE-ALGAE COLLISION AND ATTACHMENT EFFICIENCIES. THE SMALLER BUBBLES GENERATED BY THE CERAMIC SPARGER UNDER CONSTANT OR OSCILLATING AIRFLOW HAD SIGNIFICANTLY FASTER RISE VELOCITIES WHEN COMPARED TO THE LARGER BUBBLES PRODUCED BY THE LIMEWOOD SPARGERS. THE FASTER VELOCITIES OF THE SMALLER BUBBLES WERE DUE TO MOMENTUM TRANSFER TO THE LIQUID PHASE. ANALYSES OF THE HARVEST ECONOMICS REVEALED THAT THE CERAMIC FLAT PLATE SPARGER WITH AN OSCILLATING AIRFLOW DELIVERED THE BEST OVERALL COST-BENEFIT RELATIONSHIP. 2014, THE AUTHOR(S)."
