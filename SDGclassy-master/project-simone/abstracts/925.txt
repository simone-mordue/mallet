"1774" "OBJECTIVE WAS TO INVESTIGATE IF TREMATODE INFECTIONS PREDISPOSE EWES TO MASTITIS AND/OR METRITIS. WE USED 80 TREMATODE-INFECTED EWES: PRIMIGRAVIDAE IN GROUP P-A AND MULTIGRAVIDAE IN M-A REMAINED UNTREATED, PRIMIGRAVIDAE IN P-B AND MULTIGRAVIDAE IN M-B WERE DRENCHED WITH NETOBIMIN AND MULTIGRAVIDAE IN M-C WERE GIVEN RAFOXANIDE. WE COLLECTED FAECAL SAMPLES FOR PARASITOLOGICAL EXAMINATION, BLOOD SAMPLES FOR -HYDROXYBUTYRATE CONCENTRATION MEASUREMENT AND UTERINE CONTENT, TEAT DUCT MATERIAL AND MILK SAMPLES FOR BACTERIOLOGICAL EXAMINATION. WE FOUND SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES IN BLOOD -HYDROXYBUTYRATE CONCENTRATIONS BETWEEN M-A, M-B AND M-C DURING PREGNANCY (P. 0.002). WE DID NOT OBSERVE SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES BETWEEN GROUPS REGARDING DEVELOPMENT OF METRITIS (P>. 0.83). WE FOUND THAT FOR M-A, M-B AND M-C EWES, RESPECTIVELY, MEDIAN TIME TO FIRST CASE OF MASTITIS WAS 5.75, 21 AND 6.75. DAYS AFTER LAMBING (P= 0.003) AND INCIDENCE RISK OF MASTITIS WAS 0.308, 0.069 AND 0.222 (P= 0.047). WE POSTULATE THAT TREMATODE INFECTIONS PREDISPOSE EWES TO MASTITIS, PERHAPS, INCREASED -HYDROXYBUTYRATE BLOOD CONCENTRATIONS ADVERSELY AFFECT MAMMARY CELLULAR DEFENCES. THIS IS THE FIRST REPORT ASSOCIATING PARASITIC INFECTIONS WITH MASTITIS IN SHEEP. 2013 ELSEVIER LTD."
