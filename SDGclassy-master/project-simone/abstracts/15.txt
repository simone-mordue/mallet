"973" "A BLACK PIGMENTED, AEROBIC ACTINOBACTERIUM, TOLERANT TO IONIZING RADIATION, DESIGNATED BMG 825T, WAS ISOLATED FROM DESERT LIMESTONE DUST IN TUNISIA. THE GROWTH RANGE WAS 10-40 C, AT PH 5.5-11.0 AND IN PRESENCE OF 2% NACL. THE DNA G + C CONTENT WAS 75.7 MOL% AND ITS CELL WALL PEPTIDOGLYCAN CONTAINED MESO-DIAMINOPIMELIC ACID. SUGARS OF WHOLE-CELL HYDROLYSATE WERE GALACTOSE, GLUCOSE, AND TRACES AMOUNT OF RIBOSE AND MANNOSE. THE PREDOMINANT MENAQUINONE WAS MK-9(H4) AND THE MAJOR FATTY ACIDS ISO-C16:0AND C16:17C. THE POLAR LIPID PROFILE COMPRISED PHOSPHATIDYLCHOLINE, PHOSPHATIDYLINOSITOL, DIPHOSPHATIDYLGLYCEROL, PHOSPHATIDYLETHANOLAMINE, HYDROXY-PHOSPHATIDYLETHANOLAMINE AND AN UNSPECIFIED GLYCOLIPID. 16S RRNA GENE SEQUENCE ANALYSIS REVEALED THAT THE STRAIN FELL INTO THE GENUS GEODERMATOPHILUS SHOWING THE HIGHEST SIMILARITY WITH GEODERMATOPHILUS POIKILOTROPHUS DSM 44209T (99.1%). DNA-DNA HYBRIDIZATION RESULTS, PHYLOGENETIC DISTINCTIVENESS, AND PHENOTYPIC PROPERTIES SUPPORTED THE CLASSIFICATION OF THIS STRAIN AS A NOVEL SPECIES OF THE GENUS GEODERMATOPHILUS, FOR WHICH THE NAME GEODERMATOPHILUS PULVERIS SP. NOV IS PROPOSED. THE TYPE STRAIN IS BMG 825T(=CECT 9003T= DSM 46839T). 2016 IUMS." "GEODERMATOPHILUS PULVERIS SP.
