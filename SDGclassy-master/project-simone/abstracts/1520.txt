ALIPHATIC AMINO SUBSTITUENTS WERE INTRODUCED AT POSITION 2. THE USE OF LINEAR OR LESS STERICALLY HINDERED AMINES GAVE RISE TO COMPOUNDS ENDOWED WITH SLIGHTLY BETTER ACTIVITY THAN THE LEAD, ON THE OTHER HAND, THE COMPOUNDS WERE LESS ACTIVE IF A BULKIER AMINO SUBSTITUENT WAS USED. SUBSTITUTION OF THE 5-NITROSO GROUP WITH A 5-CYANO-NNO-AZOXY MOIETY AFFORDED A NEW CLASS OF INHIBITORS, THE ACTIVITY OF WHICH AGAINST CDK2 WAS FOUND TO BE SIMILAR TO THAT OF THE NITROSO SERIES. THE MOST ACTIVE NITROSO COMPOUND WAS 8 B ((2S)-2-[(4-AMINO-6-CYCLOHEXYLMETHOXY-5-NITROSOPYRIMIDIN-2-YL)AMINO]PROPAN-1-OL, IC50=0.16 M), WHILE IN THE 5-CYANO-NNO-AZOXY SERIES THE MOST ACTIVE COMPOUND WAS 9 B (4-AMINO-5-[(Z)-CYANO-NNO-AZOXY]-2-[(2S)-1-HYDROXYPROPAN-2-YL]AMINO-6-CYCLOHEXYLMETHOXYPYRIMIDINE, IC50=0.30 M). TAKEN TOGETHER, THESE NEW ANALOGUES OF NU6027 ENHANCE OUR UNDERSTANDING OF THE STRUCTUREACTIVITY RELATIONSHIPS FOR 2,4-DIAMINOPYRIMIDINE CDK2 INHIBITORS. 2016 WILEY-VCH VERLAG GMBH & CO.
