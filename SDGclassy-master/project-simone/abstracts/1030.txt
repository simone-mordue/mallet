"1684" "POLYOXOVANADATE NA6V10O28 IS INVESTIGATED FOR THE FIRST TIME AS ELECTRODE MATERIAL FOR SUPERCAPACITORS (SCS). THE ELECTROCHEMICAL PROPERTIES OF NA6V10O28 ELECTRODES ARE STUDIED IN LI+-CONTAINING ORGANIC ELECTROLYTE (1M LICLO4 IN PROPYLENE CARBONATE) BY GALVANOSTATIC CHARGE/DISCHARGE AND CYCLIC VOLTAMMETRY IN A THREE-ELECTRODE CONFIGURATION. NA6V 10O28 ELECTRODES EXHIBIT HIGH SPECIFIC CAPACITANCES OF UP TO 354 FG-1. AN ASYMMETRIC SC WITH ACTIVATED CARBON AS POSITIVE ELECTRODE AND NA6V10O28 AS NEGATIVE ELECTRODE IS FABRICATED AND EXHIBITS A HIGH ENERGY DENSITY OF 73 WHKG-1 WITH A POWER DENSITY OF 312 WKG-1, WHICH SUCCESSFULLY DEMONSTRATES THAT NA6V10O28 IS A PROMISING ELECTRODE MATERIAL FOR HIGH-ENERGY SC APPLICATIONS. 2014 WILEY-VCH VERLAG GMBH &AMP, CO.
