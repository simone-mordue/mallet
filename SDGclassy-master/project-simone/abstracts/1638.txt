"15" "THE VARIATIONAL MULTI-CONFIGURATIONAL GAUSSIAN (VMCG) APPROACH OFFERS A FRAMEWORK TO PERFORM EXACT TRAJECTORY-BASED QUANTUM DYNAMICS. HEREIN WE USE TWO MODEL VIBRONIC COUPLING HAMILTONIANS OF PYRAZINE TO EXPLORE, FOR THE FIRST TIME, THE INFLUENCE OF THE COUPLING BETWEEN THE EXTERNAL FIELD AND THE GAUSSIAN BASIS FUNCTIONS (GBFS) IN VMCG ON THE DYNAMICS. WE SHOW THAT WHEN THE EXCITATION PULSE IS SHORT COMPARED TO THE NUCLEAR DYNAMICS, VERTICAL PROJECTION WITHOUT A FIELD AND EXPLICIT DESCRIPTION OF THE EXTERNAL FIELD CONVERGE. FOR LONGER PULSES, A SIZEABLE CHANGE IS OBSERVED. WE DEMONSTRATE THAT COMPARATIVELY FEW GBFS ARE SUFFICIENT TO PROVIDE QUALITATIVE AGREEMENT TO MCTDH DYNAMICS AND A QUANTITATIVE AGREEMENT CAN BE ACHIEVED USING 100 GBFS. LONGER PULSES REQUIRE MORE GBFS DUE TO THE PROLONGED COUPLING BETWEEN THE GROUND AND EXCITED STATES. THROUGHOUT THIS WORK THE SINGLE SET FORMALISM OFFERS THE FASTEST CONVERGENCE. 2019" "EXCITED STATE DYNAMICS INITIATED BY AN ELECTROMAGNETIC FIELD WITHIN THE VARIATIONAL MULTI-CONFIGURATIONAL GAUSSIAN (VMCG) METHOD" "EXTERNAL FIELD; NONADIABATIC; QUANTUM DYNAMICS; VARIATIONAL MULTI-CONFIGURATIONAL GAUSSIAN METHOD"
