"1158" "A SIMPLE, CONVENIENT METHOD FOR THE FORMATION OF HYBRID METAL/CONDUCTIVE POLYMER NANOSTRUCTURES IS DESCRIBED. POLYIMIDAZOLE (PIM) HAS BEEN TEMPLATED ON -DNA VIA OXIDATIVE POLYMERISATION OF IMIDAZOLE USING FECL3 TO PRODUCE CONDUCTIVE PIM/DNA NANOWIRES. THE PIM/DNA NANOWIRES WERE DECORATED WITH PD (PD/PIM/DNA) BY ELECTROLESS REDUCTION OF WITH NABH4 IN THE PRESENCE OF PIM/DNA, THE CHOICE OF IMIDAZOLE WAS MOTIVATED BY THE POTENTIAL PD(II) BINDING SITE AT THE PYRIDINIC N ATOM. THE FORMATION OF PIM/DNA AND THE PRESENCE OF METALLIC PD ON PD/PIM/DNA NANOWIRES WERE VERIFIED BY FTIR, UV-VIS AND XPS SPECTROSCOPY TECHNIQUES. AFM STUDIES SHOW THAT THE NANOWIRES HAVE DIAMETERS IN THE RANGE 5-45 NM WITH A SLIGHTLY GREATER MEAN DIAMETER (17.1 0.75 NM) FOR THE PD-DECORATED NANOWIRES THAN THE PIM/DNA NANOWIRES (14.5 0.89 NM). AFTER INCUBATION FOR 24 H IN THE POLYMERISATION SOLUTION, THE PIM/DNA NANOWIRES SHOW A SMOOTH, UNIFORM MORPHOLOGY, WHICH IS RETAINED AFTER DECORATION WITH PD. USING A COMBINATION OF SCANNED CONDUCTANCE MICROSCOPY, CONDUCTIVE AFM AND TWO-TERMINAL MEASUREMENTS WE SHOW THAT BOTH TYPES OF NANOWIRE ARE CONDUCTIVE AND THAT IT IS POSSIBLE TO DISCRIMINATE DIFFERENT POSSIBLE MECHANISMS OF TRANSPORT. THE CONDUCTIVITY OF THE PD/PIM/DNA NANOWIRES, (0.1-1.4 S CM-1), IS COMPARABLE TO THE PIM/DNA NANOWIRES (0.37 0.029 S CM-1). IN ADDITION, THE CONDUCTANCE OF PD/PIM/DNA NANOWIRES EXHIBITS ARRHENIUS BEHAVIOUR (E A=0.43 0.02 EV) AS A FUNCTION OF TEMPERATURE IN CONTRAST TO SIMPLE PD/DNA NANOWIRES. THESE RESULTS INDICATE THAT ALTHOUGH THE PD CRYSTALLITES ON PD/PIM/DNA NANOWIRES DECORATE THE PIM POLYMER, THE MAJOR CURRENT PATHWAY IS THROUGH THE POLYMER RATHER THAN THE PD. 2016 IOP PUBLISHING LTD."
