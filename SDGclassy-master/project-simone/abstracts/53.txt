"876" "A NEW FAMILY OF CYCLOMETALLATED GOLD(III) THIOLATO COMPLEXES BASED ON PYRAZINE-CENTRED PINCER LIGANDS HAS BEEN PREPARED, (C^NPZ^C)AUSR, WHERE C^NPZ^C=2,6-BIS(4-BUTC6H4)PYRAZINE DIANION AND R=PH (1), C6H4TBU-4 (2), 2-PYRIDYL (3), 1-NAPHTHYL (1-NP, 4), 2-NP (5), QUINOLINYL (QUIN, 6), 4-METHYLCOUMARINYL (COUM, 7) AND 1-ADAMANTYL (8). THE COMPLEXES WERE ISOLATED AS YELLOW TO RED SOLIDS IN HIGH YIELDS USING MILD SYNTHETIC CONDITIONS. THE SINGLE-CRYSTAL X-RAY STRUCTURES REVEALED THAT THE COLOUR OF THE DEEP-RED SOLIDS IS ASSOCIATED WITH THE FORMATION OF A PARTICULAR TYPE OF SHORT (3.23.3 ) INTERMOLECULAR PYRAZINEPYRAZINE -INTERACTIONS. IN SOME CASES, YELLOW AND RED CRYSTAL POLYMORPHS WERE FORMED, ONLY THE LATTER WERE EMISSIVE AT ROOM TEMPERATURE. COMBINED NMR AND UV/VIS TECHNIQUES SHOWED THAT THE SUPRAMOLECULAR -STACKING INTERACTIONS PERSIST IN SOLUTION AND GIVE RISE TO INTENSE DEEP-RED PHOTOLUMINESCENCE. MONOMERIC MOLECULES SHOW VIBRONICALLY STRUCTURED GREEN EMISSIONS AT LOW TEMPERATURE, ASSIGNED TO LIGAND-BASED3IL(C^N^C) TRIPLET EMISSIONS. BY CONTRAST, THE UNSTRUCTURED RED EMISSIONS CORRELATE MAINLY WITH A3LLCT(SR(C^NPZ^C)2) CHARGE TRANSFER TRANSITION FROM THE THIOLATE LIGAND TO THE DIMERIZED PYRAZINE. UNUSUALLY, THE -INTERACTIONS CAN BE INFLUENCED BY SAMPLE TREATMENT IN SOLUTION, SUCH THAT THE EMISSIONS CAN SWITCH REVERSIBLY FROM RED TO GREEN. TO OUR KNOWLEDGE THIS IS THE FIRST REPORT OF AGGREGATION-ENHANCED EMISSION IN GOLD(III) CHEMISTRY. 2016 THE AUTHORS. PUBLISHED BY WILEY-VCH VERLAG GMBH & CO. KGAA."
