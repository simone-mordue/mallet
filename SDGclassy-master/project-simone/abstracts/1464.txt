"66" "THE INTERDEPENDENT RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN RESEARCH AND TEACHING IS AT THE HEART OF RESEARCH-INTENSIVE UNIVERSITIES. IN THE PRESENT STUDY, AN INITIAL ELECTRONIC QUANTITATIVE SURVEY WAS UNDERTAKEN FOLLOWING WHICH, WE PERFORMED 28 IN-DEPTH, SEMI-STRUCTURED INTERVIEWS AMONGST A CROSS-SECTION OF FACULTY IN A RESEARCH INTENSIVE IRISH UNIVERSITY TO CAPTURE HOW FACULTY CONCEPTUALISE THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN RESEARCH AND TEACHING. OUR QUALITATIVE ANALYSIS REVEALED A DYNAMIC FRAMEWORK WITH THREE INTERACTING PHASES: 1) TEACHING IS ENHANCED BY RESEARCH 2) LEARNING RESEARCH SKILLS AND COMPETENCIES, AND 3) STUDENT ENGAGEMENT WITH RESEARCH PRACTICE. THESE THEMES CONTRIBUTE TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE STUDENT AS A RESEARCHER AND THE IMPLICIT VISION OF THE RESEARCH-INTENSIVE UNIVERSITY AS A COMMUNITY OF SCHOLARS WHERE TEACHING ENHANCES RESEARCH AND RESEARCH ENHANCES TEACHING. THE PERCEIVED BENEFITS OF TEACHING ON RESEARCH PROVIDES A NEW INSIGHT INTO THE RESEARCH AND TEACHING NEXUS FROM WHICH THE OPPORTUNITY EXISTS TO FOSTER THESE APPROACHES AND DEVELOP INSTITUTIONAL POLICY TO GROW AND SUSTAIN THE RESEARCH-TEACHING INTERACTIONS. 2017 ELSEVIER LTD" "ACADEMICS CONCEPTUALISATIONS OF THE RESEARCH-TEACHING NEXUS IN A RESEARCH-INTENSIVE IRISH UNIVERSITY: A DYNAMIC FRAMEWORK FOR GROWTH & DEVELOPMENT" "ACADEMIC FACULTY; QUALITATIVE STUDY; RESEARCH INTENSIVE UNIVERSITY; RESEARCH-TEACHING LINKAGES; RESEARCH-TEACHING NEXUS"
