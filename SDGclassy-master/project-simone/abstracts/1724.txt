"514" "THIS STUDY ASSESSED THE PROTECTIVE EFFECTS OF CINNAMOMUM CASSIA (CINNAMON) BARK EXTRACT IN RATS EXPOSED TO TITANIUM DIOXIDE NANOPARTICLES OR TITANIUM DIOXIDE BULK SALT. FOR IN VIVO EVALUATION OF THE AMELIORATIVE ROLE OF THE CINNAMON EXTRACT, THE EXPERIMENTAL GROUPS WERE ORALLY ADMINISTERED WITH THE CINNAMON EXTRACT AT DIFFERENT DOSE LEVELS (50 OR 100 OR 150 MG/KG BODYWEIGHT) ALONG WITH THE SUBCUTANEOUS INJECTIONS OF 150 MG/KG BODYWEIGHT TITANIUM DIOXIDE NANOPARTICLES OR TITANIUM DIOXIDE BULK SALT. THE EXTRACT SHOWED SIGNIFICANT AMELIORATIVE ROLE ON THE ANTIOXIDANT SYSTEM IN RESPONSE TO ELEVATED LEVELS OF TITANIUM DIOXIDE NANOPARTICLES OR TITANIUM DIOXIDE BULK SALT-INDUCED OXIDATIVE STRESS. IT AIDED IN THE RECOVERY OF THE ANTIOXIDANT SYSTEM AS WELL AS PROTECTIVE ROLE IN HISTOLOGICAL DAMAGES AND SOME HAEMATOLOGICAL PARAMETERS IN THE RAT LIVER TREATED WITH TITANIUM DIOXIDE NANOPARTICLES OR TITANIUM DIOXIDE BULK SALT.
