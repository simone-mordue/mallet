"1338" "ABSTRACT TYPE A NON-CATALYTIC CARBOHYDRATE-BINDING MODULES (CBMS), EXEMPLIFIED BY CTCBM3ACIPA, ARE WIDELY BELIEVED TO SPECIFICALLY TARGET CRYSTALLINE CELLULOSE THROUGH ENTROPIC FORCES. HERE WE HAVE TESTED THE HYPOTHESIS THAT TYPE A CBMS CAN ALSO BIND TO XYLOGLUCAN (XG), A SOLUBLE -1,4-GLUCAN CONTAINING -1,6-XYLOSE SIDE CHAINS. CTCBM3ACIPA BOUND TO XYLOGLUCAN IN CELL WALLS AND ARRAYED ON SOLID SURFACES. XYLOGLUCAN AND CELLULOSE WERE SHOWN TO BIND TO THE SAME PLANAR SURFACE ON CBM3ACIPA. A RANGE OF TYPE A CBMS FROM DIFFERENT FAMILIES WERE SHOWN TO BIND TO XYLOGLUCAN IN SOLUTION WITH LIGAND BINDING DRIVEN BY ENTHALPIC CHANGES. THE NATURE OF CBM-POLYSACCHARIDE INTERACTIONS IS DISCUSSED. 2015 FEDERATION OF EUROPEAN BIOCHEMICAL SOCIETIES."
