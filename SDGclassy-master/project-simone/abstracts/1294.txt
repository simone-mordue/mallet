"1946" "THE AIM OF THIS PAPER IS TO PRESENT AN EFFICIENT TOOL FOR EVALUATING THE ECONOMY PART OF THE SUSTAINABILITY OF PIG FARMING SYSTEMS. THE SELECTED TOOL IDEA WAS TESTED ON A SAMPLE OF FARMS FROM 15 CONTRASTED SYSTEMS IN EUROPE. A STATISTICAL ANALYSIS WAS CARRIED OUT TO CHECK THE CAPACITY OF THE INDICATORS TO ILLUSTRATE THE VARIABILITY OF THE POPULATION AND TO ANALYZE WHICH OF THESE INDICATORS CONTRIBUTED THE MOST TOWARDS IT. THE SCORES OBTAINED FOR THE FARMS WERE CONSISTENT WITH THE REALITY OF PIG PRODUCTION, THE VARIABLE DISTRIBUTION SHOWED AN IMPORTANT VARIABILITY OF THE SAMPLE. THE PRINCIPAL COMPONENT ANALYSIS AND CLUSTER ANALYSIS SEPARATED THE SAMPLE INTO FIVE SUBGROUPS, IN WHICH THE SIX MAIN INDICATORS SIGNIFICANTLY DIFFERED, WHICH UNDERLINES THE ROBUSTNESS OF THE TOOL. THE IDEA METHOD WAS PROVEN TO BE EASILY COMPREHENSIBLE, REQUIRING FEW INITIAL VARIABLES AND WITH AN EFFICIENT BENCHMARKING SYSTEM, ALL SIX INDICATORS CONTRIBUTED TO FULLY DESCRIBE A VARIED AND CONTRASTED POPULATION.
