"1220" "STUDYQUESTION: DOES ADVANCED MATERNAL AGE (AMA) IN MICE AFFECT CARDIOMETABOLIC HEALTH DURING POST-NATAL LIFE IN OFFSPRING DERIVED FROM AN ASSISTED REPRODUCTION TECHNOLOGY (ART) PROCEDURE? SUMMARYANSWER: OFFSPRING DERIVED FROM BLASTOCYSTS COLLECTED FROM AGED FEMALE MICE DISPLAYED IMPAIRED BODY WEIGHT GAIN, BLOOD PRESSURE, GLUCOSE METABOLISM AND ORGAN ALLOMETRY DURING POST-NATAL LIFE COMPARED WITH OFFSPRING DERIVED FROMBLASTOCYSTS FROMYOUNG FEMALES, SINCE ALL BLASTOCYSTS WERE TRANSFERRED TO NORMALIZED YOUNG MOTHERS, THIS EFFECT IS INDEPENDENT OF MATERNAL PREGNANCY CONDITIONS. WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY: ALTHOUGH STUDIES IN MICE HAVE SHOWN THAT AMA CAN AFFECT BODY WEIGHT AND BEHAVIOUR OF OFFSPRING DERIVED FROM NATURAL REPRODUCTION, DATA ON THE EFFECTS OFAMAON OFFSPRING CARDIOMETABOLIC HEALTH DURING POST-NATAL DEVELOPMENT ARE NOT AVAILABLE. GIVEN THE INCREASING USE OF ART TO ALLEVIATE INFERTILITY IN WOMEN OF AMA, IT IS PIVOTAL TO DEVELOP ART-AMA MODELS ADDRESSING THE EFFECTS OF MATERNAL AGING ON OFFSPRING HEALTH. STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION: BLASTOCYSTS FROMOLD (34-39 WEEKS) OR YOUNG (8-9 WEEKS) C57BL/6 FEMALES MATED WITH YOUNGCBA MALES (13-15 WEEKS) WERE EITHER SUBJECTED TO DIFFERENTIAL CELL STAINING (INNER CELL MASS AND TROPHECTODERM) OR UNDERWENT EMBRYO TRANSFER (ET) INTO YOUNG MF1 SURROGATES (8-9 WEEKS) TO PRODUCE YOUNG (YOUNG-ET, 9 LITTERS) AND OLD (OLD-ET, 10 LITTERS) EMBRYO-DERIVED OFFSPRING. OFFSPRING HEALTH MONITORING WAS CARRIED OUT FOR 30 WEEKS. PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS: ALL ANIMALS WERE FED WITH STANDARD CHOW. BLOOD PRESSURE WAS MEASURED AT POST-NATAL WEEKS 9, 15 AND 21, AND AT POST-NATAL WEEK 30 A GLUCOSE TOLERANCE TEST (GTT) WAS PERFORMED. TWO DAYS AFTER THE GTT MICE WERE KILLED FOR ORGAN ALLOMETRY. BLASTOCYST CELL ALLOCATION VARIABLES WERE EVALUATED BY T-TEST AND DEVELOPMENTAL DATA WERE ANALYSED WITH A MULTILEVEL RANDOM EFFECTS REGRESSION MODEL. MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE: THE TOTAL NUMBEROF CELLS IN BLASTOCYSTS FROMAGEDMICEWAS DECREASED (P&LT, 0.05) RELATIVE TO YOUNG MICE DUE TO A LOWER NUMBER OF CELLS IN THE TROPHECTODERM (MEANSEM: 34.52.1 VERSUS 29.61.0).WEEKLY BODY WEIGHT DID NOT DIFFER IN MALE OFFSPRING, BUT AN INCREASE IN BODY WEIGHT FROMWEEK 13 ONWARDS WAS OBSERVED IN OLD-ET FEMALES (FINAL BODY WEIGHT AT POST-NATALWEEK 30: 38.50.8 VERSUS 33.40.8 G, P&LT, 0.05). BLOOD PRESSURE WAS INCREASED IN OLD-ET OFFSPRING AT WEEKS 9-15 IN MALES (WEEK 9: 108.53.13 VERSUS 100.81.5 MMHG, WEEK 15: 112.93.2 VERSUS 103.42.1 MMHG) AND WEEK 15 IN FEMALES (115.93.7 VERSUS 102.80.7 MMHG, ALL P&LT, 0.05 VERSUS YOUNG-ET). THE GTT RESULTS AND ORGAN ALLOMETRY WERE NOT AFFECTED IN MALE OFFSPRING. IN CONTRAST, OLD-ET FEMALES DISPLAYED A GREATER (P&LT, 0.05) PEAK GLUCOSE CONCENTRATION AT 30 MIN DURING THE GTT (21.10.4 VERSUS 17.81.16 MMOL/L) AND THEIR SPLEEN WEIGHT (88.22.6105.14.6 MG) AND SEVERAL ORGAN:BODY WEIGHT RATIOS (G/G 103) WERE DECREASED (P&LT, 0.05 VERSUS YOUNG-ET), INCLUDING THE HEART (3.70.06 VERSUS 4.40.08), LUNGS (4.40.1 VERSUS 5.00.1), SPLEEN (2.40.06 VERSUS 3.20.1) AND LIVER (36.40.6 VERSUS 39.10.9). LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION: RESULTS FROMEXPERIMENTAL ANIMALMODELS CANNOTBE EXTRAPOLATED TOHUMANS.NEVERTHELESS, THEY ARE VALUABLE TO DEVELOP CONCEPTUAL MODELS THAT CAN PRODUCE HYPOTHESES FOR EVENTUAL TESTING IN THE TARGET SPECIES (I.E. HUMANS). WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS: OUR DATA SHOW THAT OFFSPRING FROM MOUSE EMBRYOS FROM AGED MOTHERS CAN DEVELOP ALTERED PHENOTYPES DURINGPOST-NATAL DEVELOPMENTCOMPAREDWITHEMBRYOS FROMYOUNGMOTHERS.BECAUSE ALL EMBRYOSWERE TRANSFERREDINTOYOUNGMOTHERS FOR THEDURATIONOFPREGNANCY TONORMALIZE THEMATERNAL IN VIVO ENVIRONMENT, OUR FINDINGS INDICATE THAT ADVERSEPROGRAMMING VIAAMAIS ALREADYESTABLISHED AT THE BLASTOCYST STAGE.WHILST HUMAN EMBRYOS DISPLAY INCREASED ANEUPLOIDY COMPARED WITHMOUSE, WE BELIEVE OUR DATA HAVE IMPLICATIONS FOR WOMEN OF AMA UNDERGOING ASSISTED REPRODUCTION, INCLUDING SURROGACY PROGRAMMES.
