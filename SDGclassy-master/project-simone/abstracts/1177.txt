"1347" "SEVEN ACIDOPHILIC ACTINOBACTERIA ISOLATED FROM HUMUS AND MINERAL LAYERS OF A SPRUCE FOREST SOIL WERE EXAMINED USING A POLYPHASIC APPROACH. CHEMOTAXONOMIC PROPERTIES OF THE ISOLATES WERE FOUND TO BE CONSISTENT WITH THEIR CLASSIFICATION IN THE GENUS ACTINOSPICA. THE STRAINS FORMED A DISTINCT PHYLETIC LINE IN THE ACTINOSPICA 16S RRNA GENE TREE BEING MOST CLOSELY RELATED TO ACTINOSPICA ROBINIAE DSM 44927T (98.7-99.3% SIMILARITY). DNA:DNA RELATEDNESS BETWEEN ISOLATE CSCA57T AND THE TYPE STRAIN OF A. ROBINIAE WAS FOUND TO BE LOW AT 40.8 (6.6) %. THE ISOLATES WERE SHOWN TO HAVE MANY PHENOTYPIC PROPERTIES IN COMMON AND WERE DISTINGUISHED READILY FROM THE TYPE STRAINS OF ACTINOSPICA ACIDIPHILA AND A. ROBINIAE USING A RANGE OF PHENOTYPIC FEATURES. ON THE BASIS OF THESE DATA THE SEVEN ISOLATES WERE CONSIDERED TO REPRESENT A NEW SPECIES FOR WHICH THE NAME ACTINOSPICA DURHAMENSIS SP. NOV. IS PROPOSED. THE TYPE STRAIN OF THE SPECIES IS CSCA 57T (=DSM 46820T=NCIMB 14953T). THE AUTHOR(S) 2015." "ACTINOSPICA DURHAMENSIS SP.
