"927" "THE COST ACTION CM1201 BIOMIMETIC RADICAL CHEMISTRY HAS BEEN ACTIVE SINCE DECEMBER 2012 FOR 4 YEARS, DEVELOPING RESEARCH TOPICS ORGANIZED INTO FOUR WORKING GROUPS: WG1RADICAL ENZYMES, WG2MODELS OF DNA DAMAGE AND CONSEQUENCES, WG3MEMBRANE STRESS, SIGNALLING AND DEFENSES, AND WG4BIO-INSPIRED SYNTHETIC STRATEGIES. INTERNATIONAL COLLABORATIONS HAVE BEEN ESTABLISHED AMONG THE PARTICIPATING 80 RESEARCH GROUPS WITH BRILLIANT INTERDISCIPLINARY ACHIEVEMENTS. FREE RADICAL RESEARCH WITH A BIOMIMETIC APPROACH HAS BEEN REALIZED IN THE COST ACTION AND ARE SUMMARIZED IN THIS OVERVIEW BY THE FOUR WG LEADERS. 2016 THE AUTHOR(S).
