"992" "THE HERITABILITY OF UDDER QUALITY TRAITS, DEFINED AS MORPHOLOGY AND COLOSTRUM IGG CONCENTRATION AT FARROWING, WAS ESTIMATED TOGETHER WITH THE GENETIC AND PHENOTYPIC CORRELATIONS OF THESE TRAITS WITH OTHER PRODUCTION AND REPRODUCTION CRITERIA. UDDER MORPHOLOGY TRAITS WERE RECORDED IN 988 MEIDAM SOWS AND COLOSTRUM SAMPLES WERE COLLECTED FROM 528 SOWS. TEAT LENGTH, TEAT DIAMETER (DIA), INTERTEAT DISTANCE WITHIN THE SAME ROW (SAMER), AND TEAT DISTANCE FROM THE ABDOMINAL MIDLINE (AML) WERE RECORDED TO THE NEAREST MILLIMETER. FOR EACH SOW, A RECORD WAS ALSO MADE OF UDDER DEVELOPMENT SCORE (DEV), THE PROPORTION OF TEATS ORIENTED PERPENDICULAR TO THE UDDER, AND THE PROPORTION OF NONFUNCTIONAL TEATS. COLOSTRUM IGG CONCENTRATION WAS ESTIMATED WITH A BRIX REFRACTOMETER. HERITABILITY OF UDDER MORPHOLOGY TRAITS VARIED FROM HIGH (H 2=0.46 FOR TEAT LENGTH AND H 2=0.56 FOR DIA) TO MODERATE (H 2=0.37 FOR SAMER, H 2=0.22 FOR AML, H 2=0.25 FOR DEV, H 2=0.3 FOR THE PROPORTION OF NONFUNCTIONAL TEATS, H 2=0.1 FOR THE PROPORTION OF TEATS ORIENTED PERPENDICULAR TO THE UDDER, AND H 2=0.35 FOR COLOSTRUM IGG CONCENTRATION). THE SAMER WAS NEGATIVELY GENETICALLY CORRELATED WITH THE NUMBER OF STILLBORNS (GENETIC CORRELATION [R G ]=0.48) AND POSITIVELY GENETICALLY CORRELATED WITH THE NUMBER OF PIGLETS BORN ALIVE (R G=0.69), WITH THE OPPOSITE FOR THE TRAIT AML (R G=0.40 FOR NUMBER OF PIGLETS BORN ALIVE AND R G=0.40 FOR STILLBORNS). THE HIGHEST GENETIC CORRELATION WITH PRODUCTIVE TRAITS WAS ESTIMATED BETWEEN AML AND ADG DURING REARING (R G=0.42), ALTHOUGH THIS HAD A NEGATIVE PHENOTYPIC CORRELATION (R P , 0.11). TEAT LENGTH WAS ALSO MODERATELY CORRELATED WITH ADG (R G=0.27). BACKFAT THICKNESS AT 100 KG WAS POSITIVELY CORRELATED WITH DIA AND THE TOTAL NUMBER OF TEATS PRESENT IN BOTH ROWS (R G=0.28 AND R G=0.36, RESPECTIVELY) AND NEGATIVELY CORRELATED ONLY WITH DEV (R G=0.22). THE SAME RESULTS WERE FOUND FOR THE PHENOTYPIC CORRELATION BETWEEN BACKFAT THICKNESS AT END OF TEST AND THE TOTAL NUMBER OF TEATS PRESENT IN BOTH ROWS (R P=0.03). UDDER QUALITY TRAITS CAN BE INCLUDED IN THE BREEDING GOAL AND APPROPRIATELY WEIGHTED WITH OTHER IMPORTANT TRAITS IN THE BREEDING OBJECTIVES TO ENHANCE MATERNAL PERFORMANCE. 2016 AMERICAN SOCIETY OF ANIMAL SCIENCE.
