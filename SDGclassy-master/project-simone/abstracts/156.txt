"772" "ALONG WITH FOOD MANUFACTURERS, RETAILERS CONTRIBUTE DIRECTLY TO THE NATIONAL DIET. WHILE EFFORTS TO REFORMULATE PRIVATE-LABEL PRODUCTS HAVE BEEN ASSESSED, LITTLE RESEARCH CONSIDERS OTHER VOLUNTARY INITIATIVES TO IMPACT PUBLIC HEALTH. WE EXPLORE EFFORTS TARGETING CHILDRENS HEALTH AND NUTRITION. MAKING USE OF THE CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY REPORTS OF THE SEVEN LEADING RETAILERS FROM 2006 TO 2011, WE EXAMINE THE TYPES OF ACTIONS, BY WHICH RETAIL CHAINS AND WHEN. BEFORE 2008, MOST RETAILERS REPORTED ON INITIATIVES PROMOTING CHILDRENS NUTRITION EDUCATION AND PHYSICAL ACTIVITY IN SCHOOLS. SINCE 2009, REFERENCES TO SUCH PROGRAMS HAVE DECREASED, WITH A SHIFT TOWARD CHILD WELLNESS. WE FIND THAT RETAILERS DIFFER IN APPROACHES AND COMMITMENT. THOSE WITH LARGER MARKET SHARES MENTION INITIATIVES MORE FREQUENTLY. MOST ACTIVITIES ARE RELATED TO NUTRITION EDUCATION, DEVELOPING COOKING SKILLS, AND PROMOTION OF PHYSICAL ACTIVITY AND NOT PRODUCT REFORMULATION. OUR RESEARCH SUGGESTS THESE EFFORTS ARE NOT COORDINATED, MIGHT BE MISPLACED, AND DO NOT PERSIST OVER TIME. 2017 TAYLOR & FRANCIS."
