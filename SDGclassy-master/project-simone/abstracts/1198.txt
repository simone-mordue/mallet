"408" "SINGLE-RADIUS FEMORAL TOTAL KNEE DESIGN AIMS TO DELIVER IMPROVED KINEMATIC BEHAVIOUR WHEN COMPARED TO THE STANDARD TWO-RADII GEOMETRY. THIS STUDY HAS EVALUATED THE BEHAVIOUR, THROUGH A FUNCTIONAL RANGE OF MOTION IN THE SAGITTAL PLANE, OF A SINGLE-RADIUS FEMORAL COMPONENT COMPARED TO A DUAL-RADIUS STANDARD KNEE CONSTRUCT. PARTICULAR FOCUS WAS PLACED ON HOW THE FLEXION AXES OF THE NATIVE AND REPLACED KNEE APPROXIMATED TO THE TRANSEPICONDYLAR AXIS THROUGH A LOADED NAVIGATED KNEE DESIGN. SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES IN FLEXION ARCS WERE NOTED BETWEEN THE NATIVE AND TOTAL KNEE ARTHROPLASTY STATE. THESE ARCS WERE NOT UNIFORM IN ALL KNEES AND DID NOT DISPLAY SINGLE-RADIUS BEHAVIOUR. THERE WERE NO SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES IN THE LOCATION OF FLEXION AXES IN THE NATIVE AND TOTAL KNEE ARTHROPLASTY KNEE. BOTH EXHIBITED SIMILAR POSTERIOR AND INFERIOR TRANSVERSE AXES OF MOTION WITH RESPECT TO THE ANATOMICAL EPICONDYLAR AXIS. THIS WORK HAS CAST DOUBT ON THE RELIABILITY UNDER LOADED CONDITIONS OF THE SINGLE-RADIUS CONCEPT, BUT THE CLOSE PROXIMITY OF THE FLEXION AXES OF EACH REPLACED KNEE IN RELATION TO THE FUNCTIONAL FLEXION AXIS OF THE NATIVE KNEE MAY BE THE TRUE BASIS OF THIS PURPORTED IMPROVED KINEMATIC PERFORMANCE. 2018, IMECHE 2018."
