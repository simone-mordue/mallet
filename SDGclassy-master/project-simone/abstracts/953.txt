"1647" "ORGANIC CULTIVATION HAS NOWADAYS SPREAD OUT AROUND THE WORLD OWING TO ITS ENVIRONMENT PRESERVATION, CONTRARY TO THE OVERUSE OF PESTICIDES AND FERTILISERS. PLANT GROWTH-PROMOTING BACTERIA (PGPB) PRODUCE INDOLE-3 ACETIC ACID (IAA), A PLANT HORMONE IMPLIED IN ROOT DEVELOPMENT. IN THIS STUDY, SEVERAL BACTERIAL ISOLATES WERE SELECTED BY THEIR IN VITRO PLANT GROWTH PROMOTING FEATURES AND EVALUATED FOR THEIR EFFECTS ON ROOTING OF MODEL PLANTS. BOTH SUPERNATANTS AND CELLS WERE TESTED INDEPENDENTLY ON VIGNA UNGUICULATA CUTTINGS. WHILE LOW CONCENTRATIONS OF IAA PRODUCED STIMULATING EFFECTS ON THE ROOT ELONGATION, A HIGHER NUMBER OF SHORT ADVENTITIOUS ROOTS WERE DISPLAYED BY CUTTINGS INOCULATED WITH HIGHLY IAA PRODUCERS. THE SELECTED STRAINS INOCULATED ON SEMI-HARDWOOD CUTTINGS OF FOUR OLIVE CULTIVARS (ARBEQUINA, HOJIBLANCA, PICUAL AND KORONEIKI) SHOWED DIFFERENT ROOTING ABILITIES, AND INNOCUOUS EFFECTS ON PLANT AFTER ONE YEAR. THE SUCCESSFUL EFFECTIVENESS OF OLIVE TREE PROPAGATION UNDER REAL NURSERY CONDITIONS SHOWN BY THE SELECTED PGPB, TOGETHER WITH EFFICIENCY, ECOLOGY AND PLANT HARMLESSNESS IN A LONG-TERM CONFIRMED ITS SUITABILITY IN ORGANIC FARMING SYSTEM AND BROADEN THE FIELD OF APPLICATION OF THIS METHOD INTO LOW ROOTING ABILITY CULTIVARS AND EVEN IN DIRECT COMPETITION WITH THE CONVENTIONAL PROPAGATION METHOD. 2014 BY NOVA SCIENCE PUBLISHERS, INC.
