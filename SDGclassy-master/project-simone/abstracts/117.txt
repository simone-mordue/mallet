"1150" "A SYSTEM APPROACH-BASED LIFE CYCLE ASSESSMENT (LCA) FRAMEWORK, COMBINED WITH A SIMPLE MECHANISTIC MODEL OF BIRD ENERGY BALANCE WAS USED TO PREDICT THE POTENTIAL EFFECTS OF 15 Y PROSPECTIVE BROILER BREEDING ON THE ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS OF THE STANDARD UK BROILER PRODUCTION SYSTEM. THE YEAR 2014 ROSS 308 GENOTYPE WAS USED AS A BASELINE, AND A FUTURE SCENARIO WAS SPECIFIED FROM RATES OF GENETIC IMPROVEMENT PREDICTED BY THE INDUSTRY. THE SCENARIO INCLUDED CHANGES IN THE TRAITS OF GROWTH RATE (REDUCING THE TIME TO REACH A TARGET WEIGHT 2.05 KG FROM 34 D TO 27 D), BODY LIPID CONTENT, CARCASS YIELD, MORTALITY AND THE NUMBER OF CHICKS PRODUCED BY A BREEDER HEN. DIET COMPOSITION WAS ADJUSTED IN ORDER TO ACCOMMODATE THE FUTURE NUTRIENT REQUIREMENTS OF THE BIRDS FOLLOWING THE GENETIC CHANGE. THE RESULTS SHOWED THAT PREDICTED CHANGES IN BIOLOGICAL PERFORMANCE DUE TO SELECTIVE BREEDING COULD LEAD TO REDUCED ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS OF THE BROILER PRODUCTION CHAIN, MOST NOTABLY IN THE EUTROPHICATION POTENTIAL (BY 12%), ACIDIFICATION POTENTIAL (BY 10%) AND ABIOTIC RESOURCE USE (BY 9%) AND GLOBAL WARMING POTENTIAL (BY 9%). THESE REDUCTIONS WERE MAINLY CAUSED BY THE REDUCED MAINTENANCE ENERGY REQUIREMENT AND THUS LOWER FEED INTAKE, RESULTING FROM THE SHORTER PRODUCTION CYCLE, TOGETHER WITH THE INCREASED CARCASS YIELD. HOWEVER, SOME ENVIRONMENTAL BENEFITS WERE LIMITED BY THE REQUIRED CHANGES IN FEED COMPOSITION (E.G., INCREASED INCLUSION OF SOY MEAL AND VEGETABLE OIL) AS A RESULT OF THE CHANGES IN BIRD NUTRIENT REQUIREMENTS. THIS STUDY IS THE FIRST ONE AIMING TO LINK THE MECHANISTIC ANIMAL MODELING APPROACH TO PREDICTED GENETIC CHANGES IN ORDER TO PRODUCE QUANTITATIVE ESTIMATES OF THE FUTURE ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS OF BROILER PRODUCTION. ALTHOUGH A MORE DETAILED UNDERSTANDING ON THE MECHANISMS OF THE POTENTIAL CHANGES IN BIRD PERFORMANCE AND THEIR CONSEQUENCES ON FEEDING AND HUSBANDRY WOULD BE STILL BE NEEDED, THE MODELING FRAMEWORK PRODUCED IN THIS STUDY PROVIDES A STARTING POINT FOR PREDICTIONS OF THE EFFECTS OF PROSPECTIVE GENETIC PROGRESS. 2015 POULTRY SCIENCE ASSOCIATION INC."
