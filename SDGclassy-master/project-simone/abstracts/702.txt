"1848" "IN THE LAST DECADE, SEVERAL STUDIES DEMONSTRATED THE EFFECTIVENESS OF ECOLOGICAL NETWORK ANALYSIS TO A BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF THE STRUCTURE BEEPLANT INTERACTION NETWORKS, HOWEVER, SUCH APPROACHES INVOLVING URBAN AREAS ARE STILL SCARCE. HERE, WE ANALYZED TWO ASSEMBLAGES OF CORBICULATE BEES (APOIDEA, APIDAE) IN TWO GEOGRAPHICALLY DISTINCT URBAN AREAS IN BRAZIL. IN BOTH STUDY AREAS, APID BEES VISITING FLOWERS WERE CAPTURED WITH AN INSECT NET. SURVEYS WERE PERFORMED BIWEEKLY AND ALTERNATELY IN EACH AREA, OVER A 1-YEAR PERIOD. BOTH URBAN AREAS WERE VERY SIMILAR FOR MOST INDICES. THE TWO SOCIAL BEEPLANT NETWORKS WERE SIGNIFICANTLY NESTED, A PATTERN USUALLY DESCRIBED FOR BEEPLANT NETWORKS AND SOMEHOW EXPECTED IN OUR STUDY, CONSIDERING THE RECOGNIZED BEHAVIOR OF SOCIAL APID BEES IN EXPLORING A WIDE RANGE OF PLANT SPECIES. THE MODULARITY MEASURES WERE LOW AND VERY SIMILAR FOR THE NETWORKS OF BOTH URBAN AREAS, A FINDING THAT COULD BE DUE AT LEAST IN PART TO THE LOW PHYLOGENETIC DISTANCE BETWEEN CORBICULATE BEES AND THE BROAD DIETARY HABITS OF THE SOCIAL APID BEES. NETWORK-LEVEL INDICES SHOWED THAT BOTH BEE ASSEMBLAGES HAD A RELATIVELY LOW NICHE OVERLAP, INDICATING THAT THE SET OF SOCIAL APID SPECIES STUDIED EXPLOITED DIFFERENTLY THE ARRAYS OF PLANTS AVAILABLE. SPECIES LEVEL INDEX (RESOURCE RANGE) SHOWED THAT IN BOTH URBAN AREAS, TRIGONA SPINIPES (FABR.) AND APIS MELLIFERA L. SHOWED THE HIGHER NUMBER OF INTERACTIONS, A RESULT THAT DEMONSTRATES THE IMPORTANCE OF THESE SPECIES IN SOCIAL BEEPLANT INTERACTION NETWORKS IN URBAN AREAS. SIMILARLY TO OTHER ECOSYSTEMS, THESE TWO APID SPECIES BEHAVED AS SUPER-GENERALISTS IN THE TWO URBAN AREAS SURVEYED HEREIN. 2014, SOCIEDADE ENTOMOLGICA DO BRASIL."
