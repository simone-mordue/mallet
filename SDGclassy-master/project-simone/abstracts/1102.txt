"85" "RAPID FORMATION OF STABLE SOIL CARBONATES OFFERS A POTENTIAL BIOLOGICALLY-MEDIATED STRATEGY FOR REMOVING ATMOSPHERIC CO 2 AND FORMS A PART OF THE NEGATIVE EMISSIONS DEBATE IN A BID TO MAINTAIN GLOBAL TEMPERATURES OF 1.5 C. MICROBIAL RESPIRATION IN SOIL AND RESPIRATION BY PLANT ROOTS LEADS TO HIGH PARTIAL PRESSURE OF CO 2 BELOW GROUND. GIVEN ADEQUATE SUPPLY OF CALCIUM IN SOIL SOLUTION THE SEQUESTRATION OF C INTO THE MINERAL CALCITE (CACO 3 ) CAN OCCUR AT RAPID RATES. WE HAVE COUPLED AN ESTABLISHED SOIL C MODEL ROTHC TO A SIMPLIFIED GEOCHEMICAL MODEL SO THAT THIS STRATEGY CAN BE EXPLORED AND ASSESSED BY SIMULATION. THE COMBINED MODEL CASPER PARTITIONS CO 2 RESPIRED BELOWGROUND INTO SOIL SOLUTION AS HCO 3 AND SIMULATES ITS REACTION WITH CA 2+ BASED ON A PARTICULAR DISSOLUTION RATE FOR CA-BEARING MINERALS, WITH PRECIPITATION OF CALCITE INTO SOIL PORES AS A CONSEQUENCE. TYPICAL MODEL OUTPUT MATCHES OBSERVED FIELD RATES OF CALCITE ACCUMULATION OVER 5 YEARS, NAMELY 81 T HA 1 , WITH 19 T CO 2 HA 1 SEQUESTERED INTO THE SOIL. 2019 THE AUTHORS" "CASPER: A MODELLING FRAMEWORK TO LINK MINERAL CARBONATION WITH THE TURNOVER OF ORGANIC MATTER IN SOIL" "CARBON CAPTURE; MINERAL WEATHERING; SOIL CARBON MODELLING; SOIL INORGANIC CARBON"
