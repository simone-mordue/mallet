"14" "WINEMAKING RESULTS IN A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF SEDIMENTS THAT ARE FORMED IN THE TANKS, THE VATS AND IN THE BOTTLES BEFORE AND AFTER FERMENTATION. LITTLE IS KNOWN ABOUT THE BIOCHEMICAL COMPOSITION OF THESE SEDIMENTS APART FROM THE FACT THAT THEY ARE ASSUMED TO BE DERIVED IN LARGE PART FROM THE GRAPE MATRIX. GLYCAN MICROARRAY TECHNOLOGY OFFERS A RELATIVELY RAPID MEANS TO TRACK THE POLYSACCHARIDES FROM THEIR ORIGIN IN THE GRAPE MATERIAL AND THROUGHOUT THE VARIOUS STEPS IN THE WINEMAKING PROCESS. IN THIS STUDY COMPREHENSIVE MICROARRAY POLYMER PROFILING (COMPP) WAS USED TO INVESTIGATE THE GLYCAN-RICH COMPOSITION OF PARTICULARLY WHITE GRAPES DURING WINEMAKING AND THEN INVESTIGATE THE EFFECTS OF RECOMBINANT AND COMMERCIAL ENZYME FORMULATIONS ON WINE SEDIMENT COMPOSITIONS. THE GROSS LEES OR SEDIMENTS PRODUCED IN THE ABSENCE OF ENZYMES WERE FOUND TO BE COMPOSED OF AN ABUNDANCE OF HOMOGALACTURONANS, RHAMNOGALACTURONANS, ARABINANS AND GALACTANS IN ADDITION TO AN ABUNDANCE OF EXTENSINS AND ARABINOGALACTAN PROTEINS. THE ADDITION OF ENZYMES WAS SHOWN TO STRIP OFF THE HOMOGALACTURONAN AND MUCH OF THE RHAMNOGALACTURONAN WITH ITS SIDE CHAINS REVEALING A SEDIMENT LAYER COMPOSED ALMOST EXCLUSIVELY OF EXTENSINS AND ARABINOGALACTAN PROTEINS. THE EFFECT OF WINEMAKING TECHNIQUES WAS SHOWN TO HAVE AN EFFECT ON THE GLYCAN-RICH WINE SEDIMENT COMPOSITIONS AND HOLDS IMPLICATIONS FOR THE MANAGEMENT OF GROSS LEES IN A WINERY ENVIRONMENT. 2019 ELSEVIER LTD" "TRACKING POLYSACCHARIDES DURING WHITE WINEMAKING USING GLYCAN MICROARRAYS REVEALS GLYCOPROTEIN-RICH SEDIMENTS" "ENZYMES; GLYCAN MICROARRAYS; GLYCOPROTEINS; POLYSACCHARIDES; WHITE WINEMAKING; WINE LEES"
