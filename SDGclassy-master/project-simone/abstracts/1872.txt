"1545" "WE PROPOSE QUANTUM VERSIONS OF THE BELL-ZIV-ZAKAI LOWER BOUNDS FOR THE ERROR IN MULTIPARAMETER ESTIMATION. AS AN APPLICATION, WE CONSIDER MEASUREMENT OF A TIME-VARYING OPTICAL PHASE SIGNAL WITH STATIONARY GAUSSIAN PRIOR STATISTICS AND A POWER-LAW SPECTRUM ~1/||P, WITH P &GT, 1. WITH NO OTHER ASSUMPTIONS, WE SHOW THAT THE MEAN-SQUARE ERROR HAS A LOWER BOUND SCALING AS 1/N2(P-1)/(P+1), WHERE N IS THE TIME-AVERAGED MEAN PHOTON FLUX. MOREOVER, WE SHOW THAT THIS SCALING IS ACHIEVABLE BY SAMPLING AND INTERPOLATION, FOR ANY P &GT, 1. THIS BOUND IS THUS A RIGOROUS GENERALIZATION OF THE HEISENBERG LIMIT, FOR MEASUREMENT OF A SINGLE UNKNOWN OPTICAL PHASE, TO A STOCHASTICALLY VARYING OPTICAL PHASE."
