"1042" "HERE, WE DESCRIBE THE DEVELOPMENT OF 16 POLYMORPHIC MICROSATELLITE MARKERS USING AN ILLUMINA MISEQ SEQUENCING APPROACH IN THE DEEP-SEA AMPHIPOD PARALICELLA TENUIPES. A TOTAL OF 25 577 844 DNA SEQUENCES WERE FILTERED FOR MICROSATELLITE MOTIFS OF WHICH 197 873 SEQUENCES WERE IDENTIFIED. FROM THESE SEQUENCES, 64 HAD SUFFICIENT FLANKING REGIONS FOR PRIMER DESIGN AND 16 OF THESE LOCI WERE POLYMORPHIC. BETWEEN 5 AND 30 ALLELES WERE DETECTED PER LOCUS, WITH AN AVERAGE OF 13.63 ALLELES PER LOCUS, ACROSS A TOTAL OF 120 INDIVIDUALS FROM 5 SEPARATE DEEP SEA TRENCHES FROM THE PACIFIC OCEAN. FOR THE 16 LOCI, OBSERVED AND EXPECTED HETEROZYGOSITY VALUES RANGED FROM 0.116 TO 0.414 AND 0.422 TO 0.820, RESPECTIVELY, WITH ONE LOCUS DISPLAYING SIGNIFICANT DEVIATION FROM HARDY-WEINBERG EQUILIBRIUM. THE MICROSATELLITE LOCI THAT HAVE BEEN ISOLATED AND DESCRIBED HERE ARE THE FIRST MOLECULAR MARKERS DEVELOPED FOR DEEP SEA AMPHIPODS AND WILL BE INVALUABLE FOR ELUCIDATING THE GENETIC POPULATION STRUCTURE AND THE EXTENT OF CONNECTIVITY BETWEEN DEEP OCEAN TRENCHES. 2016 THE AMERICAN GENETIC ASSOCIATION. 2016.
