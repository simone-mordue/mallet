"487" "WE DEMONSTRATE, FOR THE FIRST TIME, THE EFFICACY OF A SURFACTANT-AIDED FOAM FLOTATION SYSTEM TO REMOVE AND ERADICATE CILIATES CONTAMINATING MICROALGAE CULTURES. USING SODIUM DODECYL SULPHATE (SDS) AS THE SURFACTANT, CILIATES REMOVAL EFFICIENCIES OF UP TO 86.6% WERE ACHIEVED FROM PURE CILIATES CULTURES AT AN SDS CONCENTRATION OF 40 MG L 1. AT THIS CONCENTRATION THE MAJORITY OF CILIATES WERE LYSED DUE TO INCREASE IN SDS CONCENTRATION IN THE COLLECTED FOAMATE. THE REMOVAL EFFICIENCY DECREASED TO 55.0% IN MIXED ALGAE-CILIATES CULTURES HOWEVER, THIS WAS COMPENSATED BY EMPLOYING A MULTISTAGE FLOTATION AND SDS (50 MG L 1) REUSE STRATEGY THAT ACHIEVED REMOVAL EFFICIENCIES OF 96.3%, LYSING ALL COLLECTED CILIATES, BUT NOT AFFECTING MICROALGAE GROWTH. THE CHEMICALS COST FOR THE PROCESS WAS US$ 0.0025 PER M3 SUBSTANTIALLY LESS THAN COMPARATOR TREATMENTS. BUILDING UPON ITS APPLICATIONS IN BIOMASS DEWATERING, PRE-PROCESSING AND STERILISING, WE ADD METAZOAN CONTAMINATION CONTROL TO THE UTILITARIAN PROPERTIES OF FOAM FLOTATION FOR THE MICROALGAE BIOTECHNOLOGY SECTOR. 2017 ELSEVIER B.V."
