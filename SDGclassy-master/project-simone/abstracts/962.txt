NONINVASIVE SAMPLING AND TREATMENT OF OVARIAN STRUCTURES IS EASILY ACCOMPLISHED WITH BOVINE OTU TECHNIQUES PROVIDING A PROMISING SYSTEM FOR IN VIVO DELIVERY OF TRANSGENES DIRECTLY INTO THE OVARY. THE CURRENT REVIEW SUMMARIZES EXISTING BOVINE OTU MODELS AND PROVIDES PROSPECTIVE APPLICATIONS OF BOVINE OTU TO UNDERTAKE RESEARCH IN REPRODUCTIVE TOPICS OF BIOMEDICAL RELEVANCE, WITH SPECIAL EMPHASIS ON THE DEVELOPMENT OF IN VIVO GENE TRANSFER STRATEGIES. 2014 COPYRIGHT TAYLOR & FRANCIS GROUP, LLC."
