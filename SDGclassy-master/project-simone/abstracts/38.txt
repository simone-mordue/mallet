"21" "A HISTORICAL ACCOUNT IS GIVEN OF THE 5-YEAR DEVELOPMENT OF DEDICATED SYNCHROTRON BEAMLINES FOR SINGLE-CRYSTAL DIFFRACTION AS APPLIED TO THE SO-CALLED SMALL-MOLECULE FIELDS OF CHEMISTRY AND MATERIALS SCIENCE. DESIGNS HAVE DRAWN ON PREVIOUS SUCCESSFUL MODELS IN MACROMOLECULAR CRYSTALLOGRAPHY, WITH APPROPRIATE MODIFICATIONS IN VIEW OF THE DIFFERENT PROPERTIES AND BEHAVIOUR OF THE RESPECTIVE SAMPLE TYPES. KEY FACTORS IN MAKING THESE FACILITIES ATTRACTIVE AND PRODUCTIVE FOR USERS INCLUDE FAMILIARITY OF OPERATIONAL PROCEDURES AND THE AVAILABILITY OF EXPERIMENTAL TECHNIQUES AND FEATURES NORMALLY FOUND IN LOCAL CHEMICAL CRYSTALLOGRAPHY LABORATORIES, ESPECIALLY FOR THE HANDLING OF SAMPLES AND PROCESSING OF DIFFRACTION DATA. BEAMLINES DEDICATED TO SINGLECRYSTAL DIFFRACTION RATHER THAN SHARED WITH OTHER TECHNIQUES CAN BE OPTIMIZED FOR EFFECTIVE AND EFFICIENT USE. THE EXPERIENCE GAINED FROM THE ORIGINAL DESIGN, DEVELOPMENT AND EXPLOITATION OF STATIONS 9.8 AND 16. SMX AT THE DARESBURY LABORATORY SYNCHROTRON RADIATION SOURCE AND BEAMLINE 11.3.1 AT THE ADVANCED LIGHT SOURCE HAVE LED TO HIGHLY PRODUCTIVE CURRENT FACILITIES AT ALS BEAMLINE 1 . .1 AND DIAMOND LIGHT SOURCE BEAMLINE I19, INCLUDING THE RECENT INTRODUCTION OF REMOTE-ACCESS OPERATION. SUCH FACILITIES HAVE GENERATED AND CONTINUE TO PROVIDE MAJOR IMPACT IN ACADEMIC AND COMMERCIAL RESEARCH THAT COULD OTHERWISE NOT BE ACHIEVED, INCLUDING PATENTS AND APPLICATIONS IN PHARMACEUTICALS, ENERGY AND GAS STORAGE SYSTEMS, AND GOVERNMENT POLICY.
