"714" "THE CONVENTION ON BIOLOGICAL DIVERSITY'S TARGET OF HALTING EXTINCTIONS BY 2020 IS LESS THAN A HANDFUL OF YEARS AWAY. CAPTIVE, OR EX SITU, MANAGEMENT HAS LONG BEEN CITED AS HAVING A POTENTIAL ROLE TO PLAY IN THE RECOVERY OF SPECIES, ALTHOUGH THIS REMAINS THE SUBJECT OF DEBATE. IUCN'S SPECIES SURVIVAL COMMISSION (IUCN SSC) PRODUCED GUIDELINES TO ASSIST IN IDENTIFYING WHEN EX SITU MANAGEMENT MAY CONTRIBUTE TO SPECIES RECOVERY IN 2002. SINCE THEN, THERE HAVE BEEN CONSIDERABLE DEVELOPMENTS IN A RANGE OF AREAS THAT MAY INFLUENCE THE DESIGN OF SUCH PROGRAMS (E.G., UNDERSTANDING OF CONSTRAINTS ON BREEDING PROGRAMS, DEVELOPMENT OF NEW TECHNIQUES AND APPROACHES, AND STRATEGIC PLANNING APPROACHES TO SPECIES CONSERVATION). IUCN SSC HAS THEREFORE REVISED ITS GUIDANCE AND PROPOSES A FIVE-STEP PROCESS: (1) COMPILE A STATUS REVIEW, (2) DEFINE THE ROLE(S) THAT EX SITU MANAGEMENT MIGHT PLAY, (3) DETERMINE THE PRECISE NATURE OF THE EX SITU POPULATION IN ORDER TO MEET IDENTIFIED ROLE(S), (4) DEFINE RESOURCES AND EXPERTISE, AND APPRAISE THE FEASIBILITY AND RISKS, AND (5) MAKE A DECISION THAT IS INFORMED BASED ON THE ABOVE ANALYSIS AND TRANSPARENT. THESE GUIDELINES OFFER AN OBJECTIVE PROCESS FOR CONSIDERING THE ROLE OF EX SITU MANAGEMENT IN SPECIES CONSERVATION. COPYRIGHT AND PHOTOCOPYING: 2016 THE AUTHORS.
