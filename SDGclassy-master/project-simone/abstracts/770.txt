"691" "IT HAS BEEN FOUND THAT A MODEL OF EXTENDED ELECTRONS IS MORE SUITED TO DESCRIBE THEORETICAL SIMULATIONS AND EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS OBTAINED VIA SCANNING TUNNELLING MICROSCOPES, BUT WHILE THE DYNAMIC PROPERTIES ARE EASILY INCORPORATED, MAGNETIC PROPERTIES, AND IN PARTICULAR ELECTRON SPIN PROPERTIES POSE A PROBLEM DUE TO THEIR CONCEIVED ISOTROPY IN THE ABSENCE OF MEASUREMENT. THE SPIN OF AN ELECTRON REACTS WITH A MAGNETIC FIELD AND THUS HAS THE PROPERTIES OF A VECTOR. HOWEVER, ELECTRON SPIN IS ALSO ISOTROPIC, SUGGESTING THAT IT DOES NOT HAVE THE PROPERTIES OF A VECTOR. THIS CENTRAL CONFLICT IN THE DESCRIPTION OF AN ELECTRONS SPIN, WE BELIEVE, IS THE ROOT OF MANY OF THE PARADOXICAL PROPERTIES MEASURED AND POSTULATED FOR QUANTUM SPIN PARTICLES. EXPLOITING A MODEL IN WHICH THE ELECTRON SPIN IS DESCRIBED CONSISTENTLY IN REAL THREE-DIMENSIONAL SPACEAN EXTENDED ELECTRON MODELWE DEMONSTRATE THAT SPIN MAY BE DESCRIBED BY A VECTOR AND STILL MAINTAIN ITS ISOTROPY. IN THIS FRAMEWORK, WE RE-EVALUATE THE STERNGERLACH EXPERIMENTS, THE EINSTEINPODOLSKYROSEN EXPERIMENTS, AND THE EFFECT OF CONSECUTIVE MEASUREMENTS AND FIND IN ALL CASES A FAIRLY INTUITIVE EXPLANATION. 2017, HIGHER EDUCATION PRESS AND SPRINGER-VERLAG BERLIN HEIDELBERG."
