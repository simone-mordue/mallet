"1117" "AEROBICALLY GROWN E. COLI CELLS REDUCED PD(II) VIA A NOVEL MECHANISM USING FORMATE AS THE ELECTRON DONOR. THIS REDUCTION WAS MONITORED IN REAL-TIME USING EXTENDED X-RAY ABSORPTION FINE STRUCTURE. TRANSMISSION ELECTRON MICROSCOPY ANALYSIS SHOWED THAT PD(0) NANOPARTICLES, CONFIRMED BY X-RAY DIFFRACTION, WERE PRECIPITATED OUTSIDE THE CELLS. THE RATE OF PD(II) REDUCTION BY E. COLI MUTANTS DEFICIENT IN A RANGE OF OXIDOREDUCTASES WAS MEASURED, SUGGESTING A MOLYBDOPROTEIN-MEDIATED MECHANISM, DISTINCT FROM THE HYDROGENASE-MEDIATED PD(II) REDUCTION PREVIOUSLY DESCRIBED FOR ANAEROBICALLY GROWN E. COLI CULTURES. THE POTENTIAL IMPLICATIONS FOR PD(II) RECOVERY AND BIOPD CATALYST FABRICATION ARE DISCUSSED. 2016 THE AUTHOR(S). PUBLISHED WITH LICENSE BY TAYLOR & FRANCIS."
