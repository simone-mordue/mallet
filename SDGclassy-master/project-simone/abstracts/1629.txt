DFT CALCULATIONS (B3PW91,3-21G) PERFORMED ON BOTH RU1 AND RU2 REVEALED THAT REDOX AT THE RUTHENIUM SITE FOR RU2 IS LESS POSITIVE BY CA. 110 MV. CONSEQUENTLY, THE ONE-ELECTRON LIGAND-BASED REDUCTION FOR RU2 IS MORE CATHODIC BY 80 MV. ELECTROCHEMISTRY EXPERIMENTS CONFIRMED THAT THE PREDICTION IS QUALITATIVELY CORRECT AND THAT THE COMPLEXES CAN EACH HOLD UP TO FIVE ELECTRONS REVERSIBLY. THE LIGANDS DIETHYL 2,2-(PYRIDINE-2,6-DIYL)BIS(QUINOLONE-4-CARBOXYLATE) (L2) AND 2,6-BIS(4-METHYLQUINOLIN-2-YL)PYRIDINE (L1) WERE USED TO PREPARE THE HOMOLEPTIC [RU(L1)2][PF6]2 (RU1) AND HETEROLEPTIC [RU(L1)(L2)][PF6]2 (RU2) COMPLEXES. ELECTROCHEMISTRY EXPERIMENTS SHOWED THAT THE COMPLEXES CAN HOLD UP TO FIVE ELECTRONS REVERSIBLY. COPYRIGHT 2015 WILEY-VCH VERLAG GMBH & CO. KGAA, WEINHEIM."
