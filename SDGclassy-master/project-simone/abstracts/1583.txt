"711" "THE SOCIAL WORLD IS COMPLEX AND EVER CHANGING. HOWEVER, TO FUNCTION, WE NEED SHARED COMMON KNOWLEDGE FOR SOCIAL RELATIONS AND SOCIAL INTERACTION. WE NEED CATEGORIES OF PEOPLE, AND ASSUMPTIONS ABOUT COLLECTIVE IDENTITIES. WHILE THIS IS NECESSARY TO MANAGE SOCIAL INTERACTION, IT ALSO LEADS TO DEBATES THAT QUESTION THE ESSENTIALISM OF COLLECTIVE ATTRIBUTES AND IDENTITIES. IN THIS ARTICLE WE ARGUE THAT ADVOCACY GROUPS CAMPAIGNING FOR THE RIGHTS OF WOMEN AND MIGRANTS CAN SOMETIMES REINFORCE AN UNDERSTANDING OF THESE GROUPS AS STATIC AND UNCHANGING AND THIS IMPEDES THEIR DEVELOPMENT. THE ARTICLE CONTENDS THAT ADVOCACY GROUPS, CAN, UNINTENTIONALLY, REINFORCE STEREOTYPES. TWO DIFFERENT DATA SETS, BOTH DRAWN FROM NORTHERN IRELAND, ARE USED TO EXPLORE THIS QUESTION. OUR CASE STUDIES RAISE GLOBAL QUESTIONS ABOUT THE NEED FOR CRITICAL ANALYSIS AND REFLECTION ON THE STRATEGIES USED BY ADVOCACY GROUPS TO ADVANCE SOCIAL EQUALITY. 2017 BY THE AUTHORS."
