"1650" "THE FLUORESCENT PROBE ROFRET CONTAINS A BODIPY MOLECULAR ROTOR CONNECTED THROUGH A SHORT TRIAZOLE-BASED SPACER TO A FULLY ALKYLATED BODIPY. FRSTER RESONANCE ENERGY TRANSFER TAKES PLACE FROM THE ROTOR TO THE OTHER BODIPY, AND IS ENHANCED TO A LIMITING VALUE AS THE VISCOSITY OF THE SOLVENT INCREASES. TIME-RESOLVED SPECTROSCOPY AND STEADY-STATE STUDIES ARE CONSISTENT WITH BOTH FORWARD AND REVERSE ENERGY TRANSFER, AND DELAYED FLUORESCENCE. FLIPPING BACK AND FORTH TO CATCH THE ENERGY: TETHERING OF A VISCOSITY-SENSITIVE BORON DIPYRROMETHENE (BODIPY) MOLECULAR ROTOR TO A FULLY ALKYLATED BODIPY THROUGH A SHORT SPACER PRODUCES THE DYAD ROFRET. FLUORESCENCE FROM THE ROTOR BODIPY IS SENSITIVE TO LOCAL VISCOSITY AND TRANSFERS THROUGH ENERGY-TRANSFER PHOTONS TO THE SECONDARY BODIPY. REVERSE ENERGY TRANSFER ALSO TAKES PLACE, BUT TO A LESSER EXTENT. 2014 WILEY-VCH VERLAG GMBH & CO. KGAA, WEINHEIM."
