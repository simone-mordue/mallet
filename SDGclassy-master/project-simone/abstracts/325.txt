"894" "BIOACCUMULATION OF HEAVY METALS AND ANALYSIS OF MINERAL ELEMENT ALONGSIDE PROXIMATE COMPOSITION WERE STUDIED IN TISSUES OF FRESHWATER MUSSELS (ANODONTA ANATINA) EXPOSED TO VARIOUS DOSES OF PB, CU AND CR IN WATER. THE CONCENTRATIONS OF ALL THE STUDIED HEAVY METALS IN SOFT TISSUES OF THE MUSSELS INCREASED AS THE METAL DOSES WERE INCREASED FROM 0 TO 360G/L OF WATER. THE HIGHEST CONCENTRATION OF CU WAS OBSERVED IN THE GILLS OF MUSSELS AT THE HIGHEST DOSE (360G/L), WHEREAS THE LOWEST CONCENTRATION WAS OBSERVED IN THE CR-EXPOSED MUSSELS AT LOWER DOSE (120G/L). AMONGST MINERAL ELEMENTS, CA WAS FOUND TO BE THE MOST ABUNDANT ELEMENT IN ALL TISSUES. THE MAXIMUM CA (156,906736MG/KG) WAS OBSERVED IN THE GILLS. THE ABUNDANCE ORDER OF THE OTHER MINERAL ELEMENTS WAS P>MN>NA>K>ZN. PROXIMATE ANALYSIS SHOWED THAT THE PROTEIN (15.451.13%), FAT (0.970.10%) AND MOISTURE (77.781.20%) CONTENTS WERE SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER IN THE FOOT, WHEREAS THE CARBOHYDRATE (15.151.30%) AND ASH (10.551.11%) CONTENTS WERE HIGHER IN THE MANTLE AND GILLS, RESPECTIVELY. IT WAS FOUND THAT THE LOW-DOSE EXPOSURE OF PB AND CU AND THE HIGH-DOSE EXPOSURE OF CR CAUSED HIGHER PROTEIN CONTENT IN THE FOOT. IT APPEARS THAT FRESHWATER MUSSELS (ANODONTA ANATINA) ARE AN ESSENTIAL TOOL FOR BIOMONITORING STUDIES. HOWEVER, SPECIFIC EVALUATION OF MUSSEL TISSUES WAS MORE EFFECTIVE THAN USING THE WHOLE ANIMAL IN THESE STUDIES. 2016, ACCADEMIA NAZIONALE DEI LINCEI."
