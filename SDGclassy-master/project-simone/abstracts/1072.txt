"191" "PURE ROTATIONAL SPECTRA OF 4-IODOIMIDAZOLE AND 2-IODOIMIDAZOLE HAVE BEEN MEASURED AND ASSIGNED TO DETERMINE ROTATIONAL, CENTRIFUGAL DISTORTION AND NUCLEAR QUADRUPOLE COUPLING CONSTANTS. SAMPLES OF EACH ISOMER WERE LASER-VAPORISED FROM THE SURFACE OF A SOLID TARGET ROD USING THE FOCUSSED PULSE OF A ND:YAG LASER PRIOR TO COOLING VIA SUPERSONIC CO-EXPANSION WITH ARGON BUFFER GAS. MICROWAVE SPECTRA WERE RECORDED BY CHIRPED-PULSE FOURIER TRANSFORM MICROWAVE SPECTROSCOPY BETWEEN 2.0 AND 18.5 GHZ. INERTIAL DEFECTS OF 4-IODOIMIDAZOLE AND 2-IODOIMIDAZOLE WERE DETERMINED TO BE 0.0906(1) A.M.U. 2 AND 0.0814(2) A.M.U. 2 RESPECTIVELY, CONSISTENT WITH RIGID PLANAR GEOMETRIES FOR THESE MOLECULES. THE EVALUATED NUCLEAR QUADRUPOLE COUPLING CONSTANTS OF IODINE ATOMS IMPLY THAT APPROXIMATELY 1% OF AN ELECTRON IS TRANSFERRED FROM THE IODINE LONE PAIR INTO AROMATIC ORBITALS WHEN IODINE IS SUBSTITUTED FOR A HYDROGEN ATOM IN EITHER THE 4- OR 2-POSITION. RESULTS ARE COMPARED WITH DATA FOR OTHER HALOGENATED AROMATIC MOLECULES AND DISCUSSED IN CONTEXT OF THE EXTENT OF CONJUGATION ACROSS THE RANGE. 2018 ELSEVIER INC."
