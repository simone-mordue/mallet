"283" "TWO ENDOPHYTIC BACTERIA (EAOD3T AND EAOD7T) WERE ISOLATED FROM THE AERIAL PART OF PLANTS OF ARTHROCNEMUM MACROSTACHYUM GROWING IN THE ODIEL MARSHES (HUELVA, SPAIN). PHYLOGENETIC ANALYSIS BASED ON 16S RRNA GENE SEQUENCES INDICATED THEIR AFFILIATION TO THE GENUS KUSHNERIA. 16S RRNA GENE SEQUENCES OF STRAINS EAOD3T AND EAOD7T SHOWED THE HIGHEST SIMILARITY TO KUSHNERIA MARISFLAVI DSM 15357T (99.0 AND 97.6 %, RESPECTIVELY). DIGITAL DNA-DNA HYBRIDIZATION STUDIES BETWEEN THE DRAFT GENOMES OF STRAIN EAOD3T AND K. MARISFLAVI DSM 15357T CORRESPONDED TO 28.5 % CONFIRMING THE NOVEL LINEAGE OF STRAIN EAOD3T IN THE GENUS KUSHNERIA. CELLS OF BOTH STRAINS WERE GRAM-STAINING-NEGATIVE, AEROBIC AND MOTILE RODS ABLE TO GROW AT 4-37C, AT PH 5.0-8.0 AND TOLERATE 0.5-25 % NACL (W/V). THEY PRESENTED UBIQUINONE Q9 AND C16: 0, C16: 17C/C16: 16C AND C18: 17C AS THE MAJOR FATTY ACIDS. THE PREDOMINANT POLAR LIPIDS WERE DIPHOSPHATIDYLGLYCEROL, PHOSPHATIDYLGLYCEROL AND PHOSPHATIDYLETHANOLAMINE. BASED ON THE PHENOTYPIC AND PHYLOGENETIC RESULTS, STRAINS EAOD3T (=CECT 9073T=LMG 29856T) AND EAOD7T (=CECT 9075T=LMG 29858T) ARE PROPOSED AS NEW REPRESENTATIVES OF THE GENUS KUSHNERIA, AND THE PROPOSED NAMES ARE KUSHNERIA PHYLLOSPHAERAE SP. NOV. AND KUSHNERIA ENDOPHYTICA SP. NOV., RESPECTIVELY. THE WHOLE GENOME SEQUENCE OF STRAIN EAOD3T HAS A TOTAL LENGTH OF 3.8MBP AND A G+C CONTENT OF 59.3 MOL%. 2018 IUMS."
