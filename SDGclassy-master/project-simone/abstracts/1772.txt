"1605" "TWO BODIPY-RUTHENIUM(II) TRIS-BIPYRIDYL DYADS WERE SYNTHESIZED FOR USE AS SENSITIZERS IN PHOTOCHEMICAL OXIDATION REACTIONS OF ORGANIC SUBSTRATES. THE SYNTHETIC STRATEGY INVOLVED THE USE OF A SIMPLE 'CLICK' CUAAC REACTION TO LINK A BODIPY SUBUNIT WITH AN ORGANOMETALLIC RUTHENIUM(II) TRIS-BIPYRIDYL COMPLEX. THE LINKING TRIAZOLE BRIDGE WAS USED TO MINIMIZE ELECTRONIC COUPLING BETWEEN THE TWO SUBUNITS. THE DYADS SHOWED IMPROVED PERFORMANCE ON ORGANIC SUBSTRATE PHOTO-OXIDATION REACTIONS COMPARED TO THE CONTROL COMPOUND WITHOUT THE BODIPY MOIETY. 2014 ELSEVIER LTD. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED."
