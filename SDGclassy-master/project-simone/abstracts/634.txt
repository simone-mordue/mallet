"1037" "HERE WE REPORT A STUDY ON THE REACTIVITY OF THE FLUORESCENT AIR-STABLE PRIMARY PHOSPHINE 8-((4-PHOSPHINO)PHENYL)-4,4-DIMETHYL-1,3,5,7-TETRAMETHYL-2,6-DIETHYL-4-BORA-3A,4A-DIAZA-S-INDACENE 4 WITH [MO(CO)6], [W(CO)6], [MO(CO)4(PIPERIDINE)] AND [W(CO)4(PIPERIDINE)] WHICH YIELDS THE MONO-PHOSPHINE [MO(CO)5(4)] 5, [W(CO)5(4)] 6 AND DI-PHOSPHINE CIS-[MO(CO)4(4)2] CIS-7 AND CIS-[W(CO)4(4)2] CIS-9 COMPLEXES AS THE PREDOMINANT PRODUCTS. IN ADDITION TO THE CHARACTERIZATION OF THESE COMPLEXES BY MULTINUCLEAR NMR AND IR SPECTROSCOPY, AND MASS SPECTROMETRY, THE SOLID-STATE STRUCTURES OF 6 AND CIS-7 HAVE ALSO BEEN DETERMINED BY SINGLE-CRYSTAL X-RAY DIFFRACTION. THE PHOTOPHYSICAL PROPERTIES OF THE COMPLEXES SHOW THAT THE INCORPORATION OF THE PHOSPHORUS LIGAND HAS A LIMITED EFFECT ON THE ABSORPTION AND EMISSION PROFILE OF THE BODIPY CORE AND THAT THEY RETAIN SIMILAR QUANTUM YIELDS TO THEIR PARENT BODIPY DYES. SMALL QUANTITIES OF THE BY-PRODUCTS TRANS-[MO(CO)4(4)2] TRANS-7, CIS-[MO(CO)4(PIPERIDINE)(4)] CIS-8 AND CIS-[W(CO)4(PIPERIDINE)(4)] CIS-10 WERE ALSO ISOLATED AND CHARACTERIZED. 2016 INFORMA UK LIMITED, TRADING AS TAYLOR & FRANCIS GROUP."
