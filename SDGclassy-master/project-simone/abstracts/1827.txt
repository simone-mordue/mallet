"1144" "VISCOSITY REDUCTION HAS A GREAT IMPACT ON THE EFFICIENCY OF ETHANOL PRODUCTION WHEN USING ROOTS AND TUBERS AS FEEDSTOCK. PLANT CELL WALL-DEGRADING ENZYMES HAVE BEEN SUCCESSFULLY APPLIED TO OVERCOME THE CHALLENGES POSED BY HIGH VISCOSITY. HOWEVER, THE CHANGES IN CELL WALL POLYMERS DURING THE VISCOSITY-REDUCING PROCESS ARE POORLY CHARACTERIZED. COMPREHENSIVE MICROARRAY POLYMER PROFILING, WHICH IS A HIGH-THROUGHPUT MICROARRAY, WAS USED FOR THE FIRST TIME TO MAP CHANGES IN THE CELL WALL POLYMERS OF SWEET POTATO (IPOMOEA BATATAS), CASSAVA (MANIHOT ESCULENTA), AND CANNA EDULIS KER. OVER THE ENTIRE VISCOSITY-REDUCING PROCESS. THE RESULTS INDICATED THAT THE COMPOSITION OF CELL WALL POLYMERS AMONG THESE THREE ROOTS AND TUBERS WAS MARKEDLY DIFFERENT. THE GEL-LIKE MATRIX AND GLYCOPROTEIN NETWORK IN THE C. EDULIS KER. CELL WALL CAUSED DIFFICULTY IN VISCOSITY REDUCTION. THE OBVIOUS VISCOSITY REDUCTION OF THE SWEET POTATO AND THE CASSAVA WAS ATTRIBUTED TO THE DEGRADATION OF HOMOGALACTURONAN AND THE RELEASED 1,4--D-GALACTAN AND 1,5--L-ARABINAN. 2015 INTERNATIONAL UNION OF BIOCHEMISTRY AND MOLECULAR BIOLOGY, INC."
