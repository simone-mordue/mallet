"940" "A NOVEL GRAM-REACTION-POSITIVE ACTINOBACTERIUM, DESIGNATED BMG 804T, WAS ISOLATED FROM AN ARCHAEOLOGICAL ROMAN POOL LOCATED IN GAFSA, TUNISIA. THE STRAIN GREW AS DRY BRIGHT ORANGE COLONIES AT 30C AND PH 6.08.0. IT CONTAINED MESO-DIAMINOPIMELIC ACID IN THE CELL WALL. THE WHOLE-CELL SUGARS CONSISTED OF GLUCOSE, RHAMNOSE AND RIBOSE. POLAR LIPIDS PRESENT WERE DIPHOSPHATIDYLGLYCEROL, PHOSPHATIDYLETHANOLAMINE, PHOSPHATIDYLCHOLINE, PHOSPHATIDYLINOSITOL, AN UNIDENTIFIED GLYCOLIPID AND TWO UNIDENTIFIED PHOSPHOLIPIDS. MK-9(H4) WAS THE PREDOMINANT MENAQUINONE. THE FATTY ACID PROFILE CONTAINED MAJOR AMOUNTS (&GT,5%) OF C17:18C, C16:17C, ISO-C15:0, ISO-C16:0 AND ISO-C16:1H. THE 16S RRNA GENE SEQUENCE OF BMG 804T SHOWED 99.4% AS HIGHEST SEQUENCE SIMILARITY WITH BLASTOCOCCUS SAXOBSIDENS. DNADNA HYBRIDIZATION BETWEEN STRAIN BMG 804T AND B. SAXOBSIDENS DSM 44509T WAS 48.66.6%. THE G+C CONTENT OF THE DNA WAS 73.7 MOL%. ON THE BASIS OF THE PHENOTYPIC AND GENOTYPIC CHARACTERISTICS, INCLUDING DNADNA HYBRIDIZATION RESULTS, BMG 804T (=DSM 46835T=CECT 8876T) IS PROPOSED AS THE TYPE STRAIN OF A NOVEL SPECIES BLASTOCOCCUS CAPSENSIS SP. NOV. EMENDED DESCRIPTIONS OF THE GENUS BLASTOCOCCUS AND THE SPECIES BLASTOCOCCUS AGGREGATUS, B. SAXOBSIDENS, BLASTOCOCCUS JEJUENSIS AND BLASTOCOCCUS ENDOPHYTICUS ARE ALSO PROPOSED. 2016 IUMS."
