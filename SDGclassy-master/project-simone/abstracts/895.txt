"1728" "N-HETEROCYCLIC CARBENES AND THEIR HEAVIER HOMOLOGUES ARE, IN PART, STABILIZED BY DELOCALIZATION OF THE N LONE PAIRS INTO THE VACANT P-ORBITAL AT CARBON (OR A HEAVIER GROUP 14 ELEMENT CENTER). THESE INTERACTIONS ARE USUALLY ABSENT IN THE CORRESPONDING P-SUBSTITUTED SPECIES, OWING TO THE LARGE BARRIER TO PLANARIZATION OF PHOSPHORUS. HOWEVER, JUDICIOUS SELECTION OF THE SUBSTITUENTS AT PHOSPHORUS HAS ENABLED THE SYNTHESIS OF A DIPHOSPHAGERMYLENE, [(DIPP) 2P]2GE, IN WHICH ONE OF THE P CENTERS IS PLANAR (DIPP=2,6-DIISOPROPYLPHENYL). THE PLANAR NATURE OF THIS P CENTER AND THE CORRESPONDINGLY SHORT PGE DISTANCE SUGGEST A SIGNIFICANT DEGREE OF PGE MULTIPLE BOND CHARACTER THAT IS DUE TO DELOCALIZATION OF THE PHOSPHORUS LONE PAIR INTO THE VACANT P-ORBITAL AT GERMANIUM. DFT CALCULATIONS SUPPORT THIS PROPOSITION AND NBO AND AIM ANALYSES ARE CONSISTENT WITH A GEP BOND ORDER GREATER THAN UNITY. ON A PLANE: AN UNUSUAL STERICALLY HINDERED DIPHOSPHAGERMYLENE (R 2P)2GE HAS BEEN SYNTHESIZED (SEE PICTURE, R=2,6-IPR 2C6H3). THIS COMPOUND POSSESSES A TRIGONAL PLANAR PHOSPHORUS ATOM, THE PLANARITY IS DUE TO EXTENSIVE DELOCALIZATION OF THE PHOSPHORUS LONE PAIR INTO THE VACANT P-ORBITAL AT GERMANIUM. DFT CALCULATIONS INDICATE THAT THE GEP BOND HAS SIGNIFICANT MULTIPLE BOND CHARACTER. 2014 WILEY-VCH VERLAG GMBH &AMP, CO. KGAA, WEINHEIM."
