"847" "THIS STUDY AIMED TO ASSESS THE WHOLE GRAIN (WG) CONTENT OF FOODS CONSUMED IN THE UK WHICH INCLUDE INGREDIENTS THAT RETAIN ALL THREE STRUCTURAL COMPONENTS OF THE GRAIN, AND CONTAINED 10% WG. DIETARY DATA FROM SEVEN STUDIES WITH 10,474 UK SUBJECTS WERE EXAMINED FOR FOODS CONTAINING WG. THE WG CONTENT WAS THEN DETERMINED FROM INGREDIENT LISTS, MANUFACTURERS INFORMATION AND RECIPES. 372 FOOD DESCRIPTORS FROM NINE FOOD GROUPS (4.4% OF ALL FOOD CODES) CONTAINED 10% WG. OF THESE 372 FOODS, 31.5% CONTAINED 51%, 30.6% 2550%, AND 37.9% 1024% WG DRY MATTER AS EATEN. THE RELATIVELY SMALL NUMBER OF WG FOODS IDENTIFIED IN THE TOTAL NUMBER OF FOODS CONSUMED CONFIRMS THE LOW CONTRIBUTION OF WG FOODS TO THE OVERALL PATTERN OF FOODS CONSUMED IN THE UK. SINCE FOODS CONTAINING <51% WG ACCOUNTED FOR THE MAJORITY OF WG FOOD CODES IDENTIFIED, RECOGNISING THE IMPORTANCE OF THESE FOODS TO WG INTAKE IS ESSENTIAL. 2016 ELSEVIER LTD" "THE WHOLE GRAIN CONTENT OF FOODS CONSUMED IN THE UK" "INTAKE; UK; WHOLE GRAIN; WHOLE-GRAIN FOODS"
