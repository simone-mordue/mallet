"407" "BACKGROUND: HERBICIDE SAFENING IN CEREALS IS LINKED TO A RAPID XENOBIOTIC RESPONSE (XR), INVOLVING THE INDUCTION OF GLUTATHIONE TRANSFERASES (GSTS). THE XR IS ALSO INVOKED BY OXIDIZED FATTY ACIDS (OXYLIPINS) RELEASED DURING PLANT STRESS, SUGGESTING A LINK BETWEEN THESE SIGNALLING AGENTS AND SAFENING. TO EXAMINE THIS RELATIONSHIP, A SERIES OF COMPOUNDS MODELLED ON THE OXYLIPINS 12-OXOPHYTODIENOIC ACID AND PHYTOPROSTANE 1, VARYING IN LIPOPHILICITY AND ELECTROPHILICITY, WERE SYNTHESIZED. COMPOUNDS WERE THEN TESTED FOR THEIR ABILITY TO INVOKE THE XR IN ARABIDOPSIS AND PROTECT RICE SEEDLINGS EXPOSED TO THE HERBICIDE PRETILACHLOR, AS COMPARED WITH THE SAFENER FENCLORIM. RESULTS: OF THE 21 COMPOUNDS TESTED, THREE INVOKED THE RAPID GST INDUCTION ASSOCIATED WITH FENCLORIM. ALL COMPOUNDS POSSESSED TWO ELECTROPHILIC CARBON CENTRES AND A LIPOPHILIC GROUP CHARACTERISTIC OF BOTH OXYLIPINS AND FENCLORIM. MINOR EFFECTS OBSERVED IN PROTECTING RICE SEEDLINGS FROM HERBICIDE DAMAGE POSITIVELY CORRELATED WITH THE XR, BUT DID NOT PROVIDE FUNCTIONAL SAFENING. CONCLUSION: THE DESIGN OF SAFENERS BASED ON THE CHARACTERISTICS OF OXYLIPINS PROVED SUCCESSFUL IN DERIVING COMPOUNDS THAT INVOKE A RAPID XR IN ARABIDOPSIS BUT NOT IN PROVIDING CLASSICAL SAFENING IN A CEREAL. THE RESULTS FURTHER SUPPORT A LINK BETWEEN SAFENER AND OXYLIPIN SIGNALLING, BUT ALSO HIGHLIGHT SPECIES-DEPENDENT DIFFERENCES IN THE RESPONSES TO THESE COMPOUNDS. 2018 THE AUTHORS.
