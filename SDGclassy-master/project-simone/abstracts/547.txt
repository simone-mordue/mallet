"12" "EXTRACELLULAR REGULATED KINASE 5 (ERK5) SIGNALLING HAS BEEN IMPLICATED IN DRIVING A NUMBER OF CELLULAR PHENOTYPES INCLUDING ENDOTHELIAL CELL ANGIOGENESIS AND TUMOUR CELL MOTILITY. NOVEL ERK5 INHIBITORS WERE IDENTIFIED USING HIGH THROUGHPUT SCREENING, WITH A SERIES OF PYRROLE-2-CARBOXAMIDES SUBSTITUTED AT THE 4-POSITION WITH AN AROYL GROUP BEING FOUND TO EXHIBIT IC50 VALUES IN THE MICROMOLAR RANGE, BUT HAVING NO SELECTIVITY AGAINST P38 MAP KINASE. TRUNCATION OF THE N-SUBSTITUENT MARGINALLY ENHANCED POTENCY (3-FOLD) AGAINST ERK5, BUT IMPORTANTLY ATTENUATED INHIBITION OF P38. SYSTEMATIC VARIATION OF THE SUBSTITUENTS ON THE AROYL GROUP LED TO THE SELECTIVE INHIBITOR 4-(2-BROMO-6-FLUOROBENZOYL)-N-(PYRIDIN-3-YL)-1H-PYRROLE-2-CARBOXAMIDE (IC50 0.82 M FOR ERK5, IC50 &GT, 120 M FOR P38). THE CRYSTAL STRUCTURE (PDB 5O7I) OF THIS COMPOUND IN COMPLEX WITH ERK5 HAS BEEN SOLVED. THIS COMPOUND WAS ORALLY BIOAVAILABLE AND INHIBITED BFGF-DRIVEN MATRIGEL PLUG ANGIOGENESIS AND TUMOUR XENOGRAFT GROWTH. THE SELECTIVE ERK5 INHIBITOR DESCRIBED HEREIN PROVIDES A LEAD FOR FURTHER DEVELOPMENT INTO A TOOL COMPOUND FOR MORE EXTENSIVE STUDIES SEEKING TO EXAMINE THE ROLE OF ERK5 SIGNALLING IN CANCER AND OTHER DISEASES. 2019 ELSEVIER MASSON SAS" "IDENTIFICATION OF A NOVEL ORALLY BIOAVAILABLE ERK5 INHIBITOR WITH SELECTIVITY OVER P38 AND BRD4" "BIOAVAILABLE; BMK1; ERK5; EXTRACELLULAR REGULATED KINASE 5; KINASE; PYRROLE CARBOXAMIDE"
