"849" "THE BIODIVERSITY CONSERVATION BILL 2015 FOR WESTERN AUSTRALIA WAS CRITICISED BY SCIENTISTS AND CONSERVATION ACTIVISTS FOR ITS PERCEIVED FLAWS AS IT PROGRESSED FROM BILL THROUGH TO ACT. IN THIS ARTICLE, WE SUMMARISE WHAT WE CONSIDER TO BE THE MAJOR FLAWS IN THE BIODIVERSITY CONSERVATION ACT 2016 (WA) AND SUGGEST FUTURE AMENDMENTS THAT COULD MAKE THE ACT FIT FOR PURPOSE. SUCH CRITICISM IS IMPORTANT AS BIODIVERSITY CONSERVATION INITIATIVES GLOBALLY APPEAR TO BE FAILING TO PREVENT BIODIVERSITY LOSSES. AS WE MOVE FURTHER INTO THE 21ST CENTURY WE NEED TO IDENTIFY, ENACT AND IMPLEMENT EFFECTIVE LEGISLATION THAT WILL PRODUCE SUCCESSFUL CONSERVATION OUTCOMES. CSIRO 2017."
