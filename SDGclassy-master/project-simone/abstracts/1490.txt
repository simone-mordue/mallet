"370" "THE MOST CRITICAL QUESTION FOR CLIMATE RESEARCH IS NO LONGER ABOUT THE PROBLEM, BUT ABOUT HOW TO FACILITATE THE TRANSFORMATIVE CHANGES NECESSARY TO AVOID CATASTROPHIC CLIMATE-INDUCED CHANGE. ADDRESSING THIS QUESTION, HOWEVER, WILL REQUIRE MASSIVE UPSCALING OF RESEARCH THAT CAN RAPIDLY ENHANCE LEARNING ABOUT TRANSFORMATIONS. TEN ESSENTIALS FOR GUIDING ACTION-ORIENTED TRANSFORMATION AND ENERGY RESEARCH ARE THEREFORE PRESENTED, FRAMED IN RELATION TO SECOND-ORDER SCIENCE. THEY INCLUDE: (1) FOCUS ON TRANSFORMATIONS TO LOW-CARBON, RESILIENT LIVING, (2) FOCUS ON SOLUTION PROCESSES, (3) FOCUS ON HOW TO PRACTICAL KNOWLEDGE, (4) APPROACH RESEARCH AS OCCURRING FROM WITHIN THE SYSTEM BEING INTERVENED, (5) WORK WITH NORMATIVE ASPECTS, (6) SEEK TO TRANSCEND CURRENT THINKING, (7) TAKE A MULTI-FACETED APPROACH TO UNDERSTAND AND SHAPE CHANGE, (8) ACKNOWLEDGE THE VALUE OF ALTERNATIVE ROLES OF RESEARCHERS, (9) ENCOURAGE SECOND-ORDER EXPERIMENTATION, AND (10) BE REFLEXIVE. JOINT APPLICATION OF THE ESSENTIALS WOULD CREATE HIGHLY ADAPTIVE, REFLEXIVE, COLLABORATIVE AND IMPACT-ORIENTED RESEARCH ABLE TO ENHANCE CAPACITY TO RESPOND TO THE CLIMATE CHALLENGE. AT PRESENT, HOWEVER, THE PRACTICE OF SUCH APPROACHES IS LIMITED AND CONSTRAINED BY DOMINANCE OF OTHER APPROACHES. FOR WIDER TRANSFORMATIONS TO LOW CARBON LIVING AND ENERGY SYSTEMS TO OCCUR, TRANSFORMATIONS WILL THEREFORE ALSO BE NEEDED IN THE WAY IN WHICH KNOWLEDGE IS PRODUCED AND USED. 2017 THE AUTHORS" "TEN ESSENTIALS FOR ACTION-ORIENTED AND SECOND ORDER ENERGY TRANSITIONS, TRANSFORMATIONS AND CLIMATE CHANGE RESEARCH" "ACTION RESEARCH; SUSTAINABILITY; SUSTAINABILITY TRANSITIONS; TRANSDISCIPLINARITY"
