"808" "DYNAMIC ASPECTS OF POLYOXOMETALATE CHEMISTRY ARE OFTEN OVERLOOKED BECAUSE OF DIFFICULTIES IN MONITORING SUBTLE STRUCTURAL AND/OR SPECIATION CHANGES IN SOLUTION. THIS CHAPTER FEATURES THE NONAQUEOUS APPROACHES TO POLYOXOMETALATE SYNTHESIS BEING DEVELOPED IN OUR LABORATORY AS A PLATFORM FOR DETAILED AND SYSTEMATIC REACTIVITY STUDIES. METHODS BASED ON METAL ALKOXIDE HYDROLYSIS ARE DESCRIBED THAT PROVIDE ACCESS TO A RANGE OF SUBSTITUTED M2W4 AND MW5 LINDQVIST-TYPE POLYOXOMETALATES CONTAINING REACTIVE MXN+ HETEROMETAL SITES, AND EXAMPLES ARE GIVEN THAT HIGHLIGHT THE IMPORTANCE OF 17O NMR AS A TOOL FOR MONITORING SOLUTION REACTIVITY. LINDQVIST-TYPE XTIW5 AND XSNW5 AND RELATED KEGGIN-TYPE XMPW11 ANIONS ARE COMPARED, AND SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES IN THEIR HYDROLYSIS AND CONDENSATION BEHAVIORS ARE DISCUSSED IN RELATION TO DFT STUDIES. THE SOLUTION REACTIVITY OBSERVED UPON HALIDE ABSTRACTION FROM CLTIW5 OR PROTONATION OF (RO)TIW5 SPECIES IS RATIONALIZED IN TERMS OF A COMMON DIFUNCTIONAL REACTIVE INTERMEDIATE [TIW5O18]2, WHICH HAS BEEN CHARACTERIZED IN ITS DIMERIC FORM. FOLLOWING THE IDENTIFICATION OF DIPROTONATED [(-O)(TIW5O18H)2]4 A NEW TYPE OF POLYOXOMETALATE LIGAND BEHAVIOR IS PROPOSED, BASED ON THE CHARACTERIZATION OF [(-O)(TIW5O18)2(SNME2)]4, 17O NMR STUDIES OF REACTIONS WITH ELECTROPHILES, AND DFT STUDIES OF [(-O)(TIW5O18)2(AUCL)]4. THE FINAL SECTION DESCRIBES NONAQUEOUS REDUCTIVE AGGREGATION REACTIONS OF (TBA)3[PMO12O40] THAT HAVE PRODUCED A FAMILY OF ELECTRON-RICH ANIONS OF THE TYPE -[PMO12O40(MLN)Z]X, AND THE REDUCTIVE DEGRADATION OF (TBA)2[MO6O19] TO GIVE THE TETRA-CAPPED -[MO13O40H4MG(DMSO)34]2+. 2017 ELSEVIER INC."
