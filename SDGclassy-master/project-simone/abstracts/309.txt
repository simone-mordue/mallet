"1199" "BARNACLE LARVAE (CYPRIDS) EXPLORE SURFACES TO IDENTIFY SUITABLE SETTLEMENT SITES. THIS PROCESS IS SELECTIVE, AND CYPRIDS RESPOND TO NUMEROUS SURFACE CUES. TO BETTER UNDERSTAND THE SETTLEMENT PROCESS, IT IS DESIRABLE TO SIMULTANEOUSLY MONITOR BOTH THE SURFACE EXPLORATION BEHAVIOR AND ANY CLOSE INTERACTIONS WITH THE SURFACE. STEREOSCOPIC 3D TRACKING OF THE CYPRIDS PROVIDES QUANTITATIVE ACCESS TO SURFACE EXPLORATION AND PRE-SETTLEMENT RITUALS. IMAGING SURFACE PLASMON RESONANCE (SPR) REVEALS ANY INTERACTIONS WITH THE SURFACES, SUCH AS SURFACE INSPECTION DURING BIPEDAL WALKING AND DEPOSITION OF TEMPORARY ADHESIVES. WE REPORT ON A COMBINATION OF BOTH TECHNIQUES TO BRING TOGETHER INFORMATION ON SWIMMING BEHAVIOR IN THE VICINITY OF THE INTERFACE AND PHYSICAL INTERACTIONS OF THE CYPRID WITH THE SURFACE. THE TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS ARE DESCRIBED, AND WE APPLIED THE SETUP TO CYPRIDS OF BALANUS AMPHITRITE. INITIAL DATA SHOWS THE APPLICABILITY OF THE COMBINED INSTRUMENT TO CORRELATE EXPLORATION AND TOUCHDOWN EVENTS ON SURFACES WITH DIFFERENT CHEMICAL TERMINATION. 2015 PUBLISHED BY ELSEVIER B.V."
