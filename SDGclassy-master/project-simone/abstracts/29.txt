"752" "A FOCUS ON THE DEVELOPMENT OF NONTOXIC COATINGS TO CONTROL MARINE BIOFOULING HAS LED TO INCREASING INTEREST IN THE SETTLEMENT BEHAVIOUR OF FOULING ORGANISMS. BARNACLES POSE A SIGNIFICANT FOULING CHALLENGE AND ACCORDINGLY THE BEHAVIOUR OF THEIR SETTLEMENT-STAGE CYPRIS LARVA (CYPRID) HAS ATTRACTED MUCH ATTENTION, YET REMAINS POORLY UNDERSTOOD. TRACKING TECHNOLOGIES HAVE BEEN DEVELOPED THAT QUANTIFY CYPRID MOVEMENT, BUT NONE HAVE SUCCESSFULLY AUTOMATED DATA ACQUISITION OVER THE PROLONGED PERIODS NECESSARY TO CAPTURE AND IDENTIFY THE FULL REPERTOIRE OF BEHAVIOURS, FROM ALIGHTING ON A SURFACE TO PERMANENT ATTACHMENT. HERE WE OUTLINE A NEW TRACKING SYSTEM AND A NOVEL CLASSIFICATION SYSTEM FOR IDENTIFYING AND QUANTIFYING THE EXPLORATORY BEHAVIOUR OF CYPRIDS. THE COMBINED SYSTEM ENABLES, FOR THE FIRST TIME, TRACKING OF MULTIPLE LARVAE, SIMULTANEOUSLY, OVER LONG PERIODS (HOURS), FOLLOWED BY AUTOMATIC CLASSIFICATION OF TYPICAL CYPRID BEHAVIOURS INTO SWIMMING, WIDE SEARCH, CLOSE SEARCH AND INSPECTION EVENTS. THE SYSTEM HAS BEEN EVALUATED BY COMPARING SETTLEMENT BEHAVIOUR IN THE LIGHT AND DARK (INFRARED ILLUMINATION) AND TRACKING ONE OF A GROUP OF 25 CYPRIDS FROM THE WATER COLUMN TO SETTLEMENT OVER THE COURSE OF 5 H. HAVING REMOVED A SIGNIFICANT TECHNICAL BARRIER TO PROGRESS IN THE FIELD, IT IS ANTICIPATED THAT THE SYSTEM WILL ACCELERATE OUR UNDERSTANDING OF THE PROCESS OF SURFACE SELECTION AND SETTLEMENT BY BARNACLES. 2017 THE AUTHORS."
