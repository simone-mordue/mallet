"305" "INDONESIA'S FISHERIES SECTOR IS CONTRIBUTING SIGNIFICANTLY TO THE STRATEGY OF NATIONAL SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT, NOT LEAST BECAUSE REGULATIONS HAVE BEEN DEVELOPED BY THE GOVERNMENT TO MANAGE AND MAINTAIN ITS TUNA RESOURCES. ONE OF THESE REGULATIONS WAS A MORATORIUM ESTABLISHED ON FISHING LICENCES FOR FOREIGN AND EX-FOREIGN FISHING VESSELS IN THE INDONESIAN FISHERIES MANAGEMENT AREA FROM 3RD NOVEMBER 201431 ST OCTOBER 2015, THE RATIONALE BEING TO REDUCE ILLEGAL, UNREPORTED AND UNREGULATED FISHING ACTIVITIES. SINCE THE IMPACT OF THIS MORATORIUM ON SMALL-SCALE COASTAL TUNA FISHERIES HAS NOT YET BEEN INVESTIGATED, THIS RESEARCH AIMED TO EXPLORE ANY SHORT-TERM EFFECTS ON POLE-AND-LINE TUNA PRODUCTION BY ANALYSIS OF DATA ON TUNA LANDINGS AND FISHERS PERCEPTIONS IN SELECTED SITES IN EASTERN INDONESIA. THE LANDINGS OF THE POLE-AND-LINE TUNA FISHERY DECREASED DURING THE MORATORIUM IN LARANTUKA BUT NO IMPACT WAS FOUND IN PULAU BACAN OR SORONG. HOWEVER, THE VAST MAJORITY OF FISHERS PERCEIVED THAT THE MORATORIUM HAD BENEFITED THEIR CATCH RATES. THE VERDICT ON THE EFFECT OF THE MORATORIUM ON FOREIGN AND EX-FOREIGN FISHING VESSELS ON THE POLE-AND-LINE FISHERY IN INDONESIA IS THEREFORE MOOT, ALTHOUGH IT IS CONCEIVABLE THAT THE MAIN EFFECT WAS TO DEMONSTRATE ENGAGEMENT OF THE GOVERNMENT WITH THE INTERNATIONAL IMPORTANCE OF THIS FISHERY. 2018" "IMPACT OF A FISHING MORATORIUM ON A TUNA POLE-AND-LINE FISHERY IN EASTERN INDONESIA" "IMPACT; INDONESIA; LANDINGS; MORATORIUM; POLE-AND-LINE; TUNA FISHERY"
