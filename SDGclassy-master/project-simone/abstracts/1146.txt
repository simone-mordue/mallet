"1905" "RHODOCOCCUS DEFLUVII STRAIN CA11T WAS ISOLATED FROM A BIOREACTOR INVOLVED IN EXTENSIVE PHOSPHORUS REMOVAL. WE HAVE SEQUENCED THE WHOLE GENOME OF THIS STRAIN, AND OUR COMPARATIVE GENOMIC AND PHYLOGENETIC ANALYSES CONFIRM ITS CLOSE RELATEDNESS WITH RHODOCOCCUS EQUI (RHODOCOCCUS HOAGII) STRAINS, WHICH SHARE >80% OF THE GENE CONTENT. THE R. EQUI VIRULENCE PLASMID IS ABSENT THOUGH MOST OF THE CHROMOSOMAL R. EQUI VIRULENCE-ASSOCIATED GENES ARE PRESENT IN R. DEFLUVII CA11T. THESE DATA SUGGEST THAT ALTHOUGH R. DEFLUVII IS AN ENVIRONMENTAL ORGANISM, IT HAS THE POTENTIAL TO COLONIZE ANIMAL HOSTS. 2014, SPRINGER-VERLAG BERLIN HEIDELBERG."
