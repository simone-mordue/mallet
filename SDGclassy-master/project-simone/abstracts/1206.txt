"1455" "SOCIAL VALUATION OF ECOSYSTEM SERVICES AND PUBLIC POLICY ALTERNATIVES IS ONE OF THE GREATEST CHALLENGES FACING ECOLOGICAL ECONOMISTS TODAY. FRAMEWORKS FOR VALUING NATURE INCREASINGLY INCLUDE SHARED/SOCIAL VALUES AS A DISTINCT CATEGORY OF VALUES. HOWEVER, THE NATURE OF SHARED/SOCIAL VALUES, AS WELL AS THEIR RELATIONSHIP TO OTHER VALUES, HAS NOT YET BEEN CLEARLY ESTABLISHED AND EMPIRICAL EVIDENCE ABOUT THE IMPORTANCE OF SHARED/SOCIAL VALUES FOR VALUATION OF ECOSYSTEM SERVICES IS LACKING. TO HELP ADDRESS THESE THEORETICAL AND EMPIRICAL LIMITATIONS, THIS PAPER OUTLINES A FRAMEWORK OF SHARED/SOCIAL VALUES ACROSS FIVE DIMENSIONS: VALUE CONCEPT, PROVIDER, INTENTION, SCALE, AND ELICITATION PROCESS. ALONG THESE DIMENSIONS WE IDENTIFY SEVEN MAIN, NON-MUTUALLY EXCLUSIVE TYPES OF SHARED VALUES: TRANSCENDENTAL, CULTURAL/SOCIETAL, COMMUNAL, GROUP, DELIBERATED AND OTHER-REGARDING VALUES, AND VALUE TO SOCIETY. USING A CASE STUDY OF A RECENT CONTROVERSIAL POLICY ON FOREST OWNERSHIP IN ENGLAND, WE CONCEPTUALISE THE DYNAMIC INTERPLAY BETWEEN SHARED/SOCIAL AND INDIVIDUAL VALUES. THE WAY IN WHICH SOCIAL VALUE IS ASSESSED IN NEOCLASSICAL ECONOMICS IS DISCUSSED AND CRITIQUED, FOLLOWED BY CONSIDERATION OF THE RELATION BETWEEN SHARED/SOCIAL VALUES AND TOTAL ECONOMIC VALUE, AND A REVIEW OF DELIBERATIVE AND NON-MONETARY METHODS FOR ASSESSING SHARED/SOCIAL VALUES. WE CONCLUDE WITH A DISCUSSION OF THE IMPORTANCE OF SHARED/SOCIAL VALUES FOR DECISION-MAKING. 2015." "WHAT ARE SHARED AND SOCIAL VALUES OF ECOSYSTEMS?"
