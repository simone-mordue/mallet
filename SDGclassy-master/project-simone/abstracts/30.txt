DICTYOSPORUS G-5T, WAS NOT VALIDLY NAMED AT THE TIME OF INITIAL PUBLICATION (1968). G-5T FORMED BLACK-COLORED COLONIES ON GYM AGAR. THE OPTIMAL GROWTH RANGE WAS 2535 C, AT PH 6.59.5 AND IN THE ABSENCE OF NACL. CHEMOTAXONOMIC AND MOLECULAR CHARACTERISTICS OF THE ISOLATE MATCHED THOSE DESCRIBED FOR MEMBERS OF THE GENUS GEODERMATOPHILUS. THE DNA G + C CONTENT OF THE STRAIN WAS 75.3 MOL %. THE PEPTIDOGLYCAN CONTAINED MESO-DIAMINOPIMELIC ACID AS DIAGNOSTIC DIAMINO ACID. THE MAIN POLAR LIPIDS WERE PHOSPHATIDYLCHOLINE, DIPHOSPHATIDYLGLYCEROL, PHOSPHATIDYLINOSITOL, PHOSPHATIDYLETHANOLAMINE AND ONE UNSPECIFIED GLYCOLIPID, MK-9(H4) WAS THE DOMINANT MENAQUINONE AND GALACTOSE WAS DETECTED AS A DIAGNOSTIC SUGAR. THE MAJOR CELLULAR FATTY ACIDS WERE BRANCHED-CHAIN SATURATED ACIDS, ISO-C16:0 AND ISO-C15:0. THE 16S RRNA GENE SHOWED 94.898.4 % SEQUENCE IDENTITY WITH THE MEMBERS OF THE GENUS GEODERMATOPHILUS. BASED ON PHENOTYPIC RESULTS AND 16S RRNA GENE SEQUENCE ANALYSIS, STRAIN G-5T IS PROPOSED TO REPRESENT A NOVEL SPECIES, GEODERMATOPHILUS DICTYOSPORUS AND THE TYPE STRAIN IS G-5T (=DSM 43161T=CCUG 62970T=MTCC 11558T=ATCC 25080T=CBS 234.69T=IFO 13317T=KCC A-0154T=NBRC 13317T).
