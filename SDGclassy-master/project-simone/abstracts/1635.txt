"1202" "THE USE OF HYDRAULIC FRACTURING (FRACKING) TO EXTRACT OIL OR GAS FROM SHALES IS A SUBJECT OF CONTROVERSY. THERE ARE MANY SCIENTIFIC QUESTIONS ABOUT THE RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH THE TECHNIQUE, AND MUCH RESEARCH REMAINS TO BE DONE. REFINE (RESEARCHING FRACKING IN EUROPE) IS A RESEARCH CONSORTIUM LED BY NEWCASTLE UNIVERSITY AND DURHAM UNIVERSITY IN THE UK, FOCUSING ON THE ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS OF SHALE GAS AND OIL EXPLOITATION USING FRACKING METHODS. THE PROJECT WAS ESTABLISHED TO ANSWER QUESTIONS RAISED BY MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC ACROSS EUROPE ON THE RISKS OF FRACKING. IT AIMS TO INFORM THE DEBATE SURROUNDING FRACKING BY UNDERTAKING SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH, WHICH WILL BE PEERREVIEWED AND OPENLY ACCESSIBLE. THIS CASE STUDY DISCUSSES THE STRUCTURE OF REFINE AND THE ISSUES ASSOCIATED WITH USING FUNDING FROM OIL AND GAS COMPANIES TO SUPPORT THE RESEARCH. THE AUTHOR(S) 2015."
