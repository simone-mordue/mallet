FURTHERMORE, ADULT FLIES MECHANICALLY VECTOR A WIDE RANGE OF ANIMAL AND HUMAN PATHOGENS AND, AS SUCH, POSE A HEALTH RISK TO BOTH LIVESTOCK AND PEOPLE. THE DEVELOPMENT OF RESISTANCE IN M. DOMESTICA POPULATIONS TO MOST OF THE INSECTICIDES USED AGAINST THEM, COUPLED WITH DIMINISHING PRODUCT AVAILABILITY IN MANY REGIONS, MEANS THAT NEW FLY CONTROL METHODS AND MATERIALS ARE CONSTANTLY REQUIRED. IN THE PRESENT STUDY, A FORMULATION OF ALLICIN, A COMPOUND DERIVED FROM GARLIC CLOVES, WAS EVALUATED AGAINST THE EGGS, LARVAE AND ADULTS OF MUSCA DOMESTICA L. AN IN-DIET LD50 OF 134PPM AGAINST LARVAE WAS ACHIEVED, WHILST MARKED OVICIDAL ACTIVITY WAS ALSO RECORDED. ADULTS WERE SIMILARLY AFFECTED WHEN EXPOSED DIRECTLY AND INDIRECTLY TO SURFACE RESIDUES OF THE COMPOUND. THE RESULTS INDICATE THAT ALLICIN EXHIBITS POTENTIAL TO BE USED AGAINST FILTH FLIES THROUGH INCORPORATION INTO THEIR DEVELOPMENTAL SUBSTRATES AND, POTENTIALLY, FOR THE CONTROL OF OTHER ECONOMICALLY IMPORTANT DIPTERAN PESTS. 2016, 2015 FERA SCIENCE LTD."
