"168" "INTRODUCTION: THIS STUDY AIMED TO (1) REPORT THE RATES OF RESISTANCE AGAINST A VARIETY OF ANTIBIOTICS FOR PURE STAPHYLOCOCCAL INFECTIONS, AND (2) EXAMINE THE IMPACT OF ALBC USE AT PRIMARY SURGERY HAS ON RESISTANCE PATTERNS FOR PATIENTS UNDERGOING FIRST-TIME REVISION OF PRIMARY HIP AND KNEE ARTHROPLASTY FOR INDICATION OF INFECTION. MATERIALS AND METHODS: DATA FROM THE NATIONAL JOINT REGISTRY DATABASE FOR ENGLAND AND WALES WERE LINKED TO MICROBIOLOGY DATA HELD BY PUBLIC HEALTH ENGLAND TO IDENTIFY A CONSECUTIVE SERIES OF 258 PRIMARY HIP AND KNEE ARTHROPLASTIES PERFORMED BETWEEN APRIL 2003 AND JANUARY 2014 THAT WENT ON TO HAVE A REVISION FOR STAPHYLOCOCCAL DEEP PERIPROSTHETIC INFECTION. MULTIVARIATE BINARY LOGISTIC REGRESSION WAS USED TO STUDY PREDICTORS OF MICROORGANISM RESISTANCE TO A RANGE OF ANTIMICROBIALS. RESULTS: AFTER ADJUSTING FOR PATIENT AND SURGICAL FACTORS, MULTIVARIATE ANALYSIS SHOWED THE USE OF GENTAMICIN-LOADED BONE CEMENT AT THE PRIMARY SURGERY WAS ASSOCIATED WITH A SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN THE RISK OF STAPHYLOCOCCAL GENTAMICIN RESISTANCE (ODDS RATIO 8.341, 95% CI 2.29730.292, P=0.001) AND METHICILLIN RESISTANCE (ODDS RATIO 3.870, 95% CI 1.31911.359, P=0.014) AT REVISION FOR INFECTION. CONCLUSIONS: CLINICIANS MUST ANTICIPATE THE POSSIBILITY OF ANTIBIOTIC RESISTANCE TO ALBC UTILISED AT PRIMARY SURGERY. 2019, THE AUTHOR(S)."
