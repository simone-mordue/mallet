"138" "THE EIGENFREQUENCIES OF FREELY PROPAGATING DIVERGENT BAROTROPIC PLANETARY AND GRAVITY WAVES IN A SPHERICAL POLAR CAP ARE DISCUSSED. THE KEY AMPLITUDE EQUATION IS DERIVED WITH THE FULL SPHERICAL GEOMETRY MAINTAINED AND LEADS TO A SECOND-ORDER DIFFERENTIAL EQUATION WITH COEFFICIENTS FUNCTIONS OF THE CO-LATITUDE. PREVIOUS STUDY OF THIS PROBLEM HAS DERIVED APPROXIMATIONS TO THE REQUISITE FREQUENCIES BY EVALUATING THESE COEFFICIENTS AT SOME CHOSEN FIXED VALUE OF THE CO-LATITUDE THEREBY REDUCING THE PROBLEM TO THAT OF A CONSTANT COEFFICIENT DIFFERENTIAL EQUATION SOLVED EASILY USING ROUTINE METHODS. HERE, WE DEMONSTRATE THAT SUCH A SIMPLIFICATION CAN BE AVOIDED SINCE THE FULL EQUATION CAN BE SOLVED BY STANDARD ASYMPTOTIC METHODS BASED ON THE LATITUDINAL LIMIT OF THE POLAR BASIN AS THE NATURAL SMALL PARAMETER. THREE-TERM ASYMPTOTIC SERIES ARE DEVELOPED WHICH ARE IN REMARKABLY GOOD ACCORD WITH NUMERICAL SOLUTIONS OF THE FULL EQUATION. 2019, 2019 THE AUTHOR(S).
