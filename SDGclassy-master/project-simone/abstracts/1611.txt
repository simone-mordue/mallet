"697" "THE TAXONOMIC POSITION OF A FILAMENTOUS ACTINOBACTERIAL STRAIN, ISOLATE H45T, RECOVERED FROM A HIGH ALTITUDE ATACAMA DESERT GRAVEL SOIL, WAS ESTABLISHED USING A POLYPHASIC APPROACH. THE STRAIN, WHICH IS KNOWN TO PRODUCE NOVEL DIENES, HAS CHEMOTAXONOMIC AND MORPHOLOGICAL PROPERTIES TYPICAL OF THE GENUS LENTZEA AND FORMED A DISTINCT BRANCH IN THE LENTZEA 16S RRNA GENE TREE THAT IS CLOSELY RELATED TO THE TYPE STRAIN OF LENTZEA KENTUCKYENSIS. THE TWO STRAINS WERE DISTINGUISHED USING A COMBINATION OF PHENOTYPIC PROPERTIES AND BY A DNA:DNA RELATEDNESS VALUE OF 37.6 4.0%. ON THE BASIS OF THESE GENOTYPIC AND PHENOTYPIC DATA IT IS PROPOSED THAT ISOLATE H45T (=NCIMB 4966T=NRRL B-65282T) BE CLASSIFIED IN THE GENUS LENTZEA AS LENTZEA CHAJNANTORENSIS SP. NOV. 2017, SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING SWITZERLAND." "LENTZEA CHAJNANTORENSIS SP. NOV., AN ACTINOBACTERIUM FROM A VERY HIGH ALTITUDE CERRO CHAJNANTOR GRAVEL SOIL IN NORTHERN CHILE" "ATACAMA DESERT; LENTZEA; POLYPHASIC TAXONOMY"
