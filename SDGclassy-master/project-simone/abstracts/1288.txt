"603" "THE ADDITION OF PHOSPHINOBORONATE ESTER PH2PBPIN (PIN=1,2-O2C2ME4) (1) TO A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT N-HETEROCYCLES HAS BEEN INVESTIGATED. REACTION OF 1 WITH PYRIDINE RESULTED IN HIGHLY SELECTIVE FORMATION OF THE CORRESPONDING 1,4-ADDITION PRODUCT, WITH ADDITION OF THE ELECTRON-DEFICIENT BPIN GROUP TO THE PYRIDINE NITROGEN ATOM AND THE PHOSPHIDO GROUP TO THE PARA CARBON ATOM. CONVERSELY, REACTIONS OF PARA-SUBSTITUTED PYRIDINE DERIVATIVES OCCURRED PREDOMINATELY TO AFFORD 1,2-ADDITION PRODUCTS WHILE QUINOLINE REACTED TO AFFORD THE 1,2-ADDUCT WHICH ULTIMATELY ISOMERIZED TO AFFORD THE CORRESPONDING 1,4-ADDITION PRODUCT. PRELIMINARY COMPUTATIONAL STUDIES HAVE BEEN UNDERTAKEN TO EXPLORE POSSIBLE PATHWAYS FOR THESE TRANSFORMATIONS INCLUDING TRANSFER OF THE PPH2 ANION FROM [B(PPH2)2PIN] TO THE 4-POSITION OF A BORENIUM/BORONIUM ACTIVATED PYRIDINE AND CONCERTED PATHWAYS FOR 1,2-ADDITION VIA INTRAMOLECULAR NUCLEOPHILIC ATTACK OF PPH2 AT C2 OF A PH2PBPIN-COORDINATED PYRIDINE VIA A FOUR-CENTERED TRANSITION STATE AND INTRAMOLECULAR TRANSFER OF PPH2 TO THE 2-POSITION OF A BORON-ACTIVATED PYRIDINE IN A PHOSPHIDO-BRIDGED DIMER INVOLVING A SIX-CENTERED TRANSITION STATE. 2017 WILEY-VCH VERLAG GMBH & CO.
