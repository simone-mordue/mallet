SHARED, PLURAL AND CULTURAL VALUES OF ECOSYSTEMS CONSTITUTE A DIFFUSE AND INTERDISCIPLINARY FIELD OF RESEARCH, COVERING AN AREA THAT LINKS QUESTIONS AROUND VALUE ONTOLOGY, ELICITATION AND AGGREGATION WITH QUESTIONS OF PARTICIPATION, ETHICS, AND SOCIAL JUSTICE. SYNTHESISING UNDERSTANDING FROM VARIOUS CONTRIBUTIONS TO THIS SPECIAL ISSUE OF ECOSYSTEM SERVICES, AND WITH A PARTICULAR FOCUS ON DELIBERATION AND DELIBERATIVE VALUATION, WE DISCUSS KEY FINDINGS AND PRESENT 35 FUTURE RESEARCH QUESTIONS IN EIGHT TOPIC AREAS: 1) THE ONTOLOGY OF SHARED VALUES, 2) THE ROLE OF CATALYST AND CONFLICT POINTS, 3) SHARED VALUES AND CULTURAL ECOSYSTEM SERVICES, 4) TRANSCENDENTAL VALUES, 5) THE PROCESS AND OUTCOMES OF DELIBERATION, 6) DELIBERATIVE MONETARY VALUATION, 7) VALUE AGGREGATION, META-VALUES AND RULES OF THE GAME, AND 8) INTEGRATING VALUATION METHODS. THE RESULTS OF THIS SPECIAL ISSUE AND THESE KEY QUESTIONS CAN HELP DEVELOP A MORE EXTENSIVE EVIDENCE BASE TO MATURE THE AREA AND DEVELOP ENVIRONMENTAL VALUATION INTO A MORE PLURALISTIC, COMPREHENSIVE, ROBUST, LEGITIMATE AND EFFECTIVE WAY OF SAFEGUARDING ECOSYSTEMS AND THEIR SERVICES FOR THE FUTURE. 2016 THE AUTHORS" "SHARED VALUES AND DELIBERATIVE VALUATION: FUTURE DIRECTIONS" "CULTURAL ECOSYSTEM SERVICES; DELIBERATIVE MONETARY VALUATION; ETHICS; INTEGRATED VALUATION; SHARED VALUES; TRANSCENDENTAL VALUES"
