"1000" "MICROBIAL FUEL CELLS (MFCS), WHICH CONVERT ORGANIC WASTE TO ELECTRICITY, COULD BE USED TO MAKE THE WASTEWATER INFRASTRUCTURE MORE ENERGY EFFICIENT AND SUSTAINABLE. HOWEVER, PLATINUM AND OTHER NON-PLATINUM CHEMICAL CATALYSTS USED FOR THE OXYGEN REDUCTION REACTION (ORR) AT THE CATHODE OF MFCS ARE UNSUSTAINABLE DUE TO THEIR HIGH COST AND LONG-TERM DEGRADATION. AEROBIC BIOCATHODES, WHICH USE MICROORGANISMS AS THE BIOCATALYSTS FOR CATHODE ORR, ARE A GOOD ALTERNATIVE TO CHEMICAL CATALYSTS. IN THE CURRENT WORK, HIGH-PERFORMING AEROBIC BIOCATHODES WITH AN ONSET POTENTIAL FOR THE ORR OF +0.4 V VS. AG/AGCL WERE ENRICHED FROM ACTIVATED SLUDGE IN ELECTROCHEMICAL HALF-CELLS POISED AT -0.1 AND + 0.2 V VS. AG/AGCL. GAMMAPROTEOBACTERIA, DISTANTLY RELATED TO ANY KNOWN CULTIVATED GAMMAPROTEOBACTERIAL LINEAGE, WERE IDENTIFIED AS DOMINANT IN THESE WORKING ELECTRODE BIOFILMS (23.3-44.3% OF READS IN 16S RRNA GENE ION TORRENT LIBRARIES), AND WERE IN VERY LOW ABUNDANCE IN NON-POLARISED CONTROL WORKING ELECTRODE BIOFILMS (0.5-0.7%). THESE GAMMAPROTEOBACTERIA WERE THEREFORE MOST LIKELY RESPONSIBLE FOR THE HIGH ACTIVITY OF BIOLOGICALLY CATALYSED ORR. IN MFC TESTS, A HIGH-PERFORMING AEROBIC BIOCATHODE INCREASED PEAK POWER 9-FOLD FROM 7 TO 62 W CM-2 IN COMPARISON TO AN UNMODIFIED CARBON CATHODE, WHICH WAS SIMILAR TO PEAK POWER WITH A PLATINUM-DOPED CATHODE AT 70 W CM-2. 2016 PUBLISHED BY ELSEVIER B.V."
