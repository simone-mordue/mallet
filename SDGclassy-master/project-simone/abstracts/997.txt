"1167" "PEST AND PATHOGENS POSE A MAJOR THREAT TO FOOD SECURITY AND THE NATURAL ENVIRONMENT, AND THESE THREATS ARE MOVING AROUND THE GLOBE. TRADE, TRAVEL AND TRANSPORT HAVE MAJOR ROLES TO PLAY IN THIS AND THUS TO IMPROVE PLANT BIOSECURITY, WE NEED ENHANCED PHYTOSANITARY INSPECTION SYSTEMS. IN ORDER TO ACHIEVE THIS, THERE IS A ROLE FOR THE MORE EFFECTIVE USE OF DIAGNOSTIC TECHNOLOGY, SUCH AS FIELD-BASED TESTING OR THE USE OF NEXT GENERATION SEQUENCING TECHNOLOGY. IN THIS REVIEW WE EXAMINE THE OPPORTUNITIES AND CHALLENGES POSED BY USING NEW TECHNOLOGY WITHIN A PLANT BIOSECURITY CONTEXT, BUT IN CONTRAST TO PREVIOUS REVIEWS, HERE WE FOCUS ON PRACTICAL CHALLENGES ASSOCIATED WITH DEPLOYMENT AND ROUTINE USE, RATHER THAN SPECIFIC TECHNICAL ISSUES. THESE KEY CHALLENGES INCLUDE THE NEED TO ACCELERATE THE DEVELOPMENT AND DEPLOYMENT OF NEW TECHNOLOGIES INTO THE FIELD, THE ACCELERATED DISCOVERY OF NEW PATHOGENS AND THE NEED FOR NEW RISK ASSESSMENT APPROACHES, AND IMPROVEMENTS TO OUR UNDERSTANDING OF HOW BEST TO DEPLOY AND USE NEW DIAGNOSTIC TOOLS FOR MAXIMUM IMPACT. THROUGHOUT WE FOCUS ON HOW INTERDISCIPLINARY APPROACHES ARE IMPORTANT TO HELP US IMPROVE OUR UNDERSTANDING AND ACHIEVE OUR GOALS. 2015, SPRINGER."
