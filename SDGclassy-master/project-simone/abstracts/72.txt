"793" "A NOVEL STRAIN BELONGING TO THE GENUS PROMICROMONOSPORA, DESIGNATED HM 533T, WAS ISOLATED FROM SOIL IN KERMAN PROVINCE, IRAN. IT PRODUCED LONG AND BRANCHED HYPHAE ON ISP 2 MEDIUM THAT DEVELOPED INTO A LARGE NUMBER OF IRREGULAR-SHAPED SPORES. IT SHOWED OPTIMAL GROWTH AT 2530 C AND PH 5.08.0 WITH 04% (W/V) NACL. THE PEPTIDOGLYCAN TYPE OF STRAIN HM 533T WAS A4 LYS L-ALAD-GLU. WHOLE-CELL HYDROLYSATES OF STRAIN HM 533T CONTAINED THE SUGARS RIBOSE, GLUCOSE AND GALACTOSE. THE MAIN PHOSPHOLIPIDS WERE PHOSPHATIDYLGLYCEROL, DIPHOSPHATIDYLGLYCEROL, PHOSPHATIDYLINOSITOL, TWO UNKNOWN GLYCOLIPIDS AND AN UNKNOWN PHOSPHOLIPID. MK-9(H4) AND MK-9(H2) WERE THE PREDOMINANT MENAQUINONES. THE FATTY ACIDS PATTERN WAS MAINLY COMPOSED OF THE SATURATED BRANCHED-CHAIN ACIDS ANTEISO-C15:0 AND ISO-C15:0. THE 16S RRNA GENE SEQUENCE ANALYSIS SHOWED THE HIGHEST PAIRWISE SEQUENCE IDENTITY (99.597.1%) WITH THE MEMBERS OF THE GENUS PROMICROMONOSPORA. BASED ON PHENOTYPIC AND GENOTYPIC FEATURES, STRAIN HM 533T IS CONSIDERED TO REPRESENT A NOVEL SPECIES OF THE GENUS PROMICROMONOSPORA, FOR WHICH THE NAME PROMICROMONOSPORA KERMANENSIS IS PROPOSED WITH STRAIN HM 533T (=DSM 45485T=UTMC 00533T=CECT 8709T) AS THE TYPE STRAIN. 2017 IUMS."
