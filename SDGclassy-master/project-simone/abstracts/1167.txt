"1736" "SALMONELLA ENTERICA IS AN OPPORTUNISTIC PATHOGEN THAT PRODUCES A [NIFE]-HYDROGENASE UNDER AEROBIC CONDITIONS. IN THE PRESENT STUDY, GENETIC ENGINEERING APPROACHES WERE USED TO FACILITATE ISOLATION OF THIS ENZYME, TERMED HYD-5. THE CRYSTAL STRUCTURE WAS DETERMINED TO A RESOLUTION OF 3.2 AND THE HYDROGENASE WAS OBSERVED TO COMPRISE ASSOCIATED LARGE AND SMALL SUBUNITS. THE STRUCTURE INDICATED THAT HIS229 FROM THE LARGE SUBUNIT WAS CLOSE TO THE PROXIMAL [4FE-3S] CLUSTER IN THE SMALL SUBUNIT. IN ADDITION, HIS 229 WAS OBSERVED TO LIE CLOSE TO A BURIED GLUTAMIC ACID (GLU 73 ), WHICH IS CONSERVED IN OXYGEN-TOLERANT HYDROGENASES. HIS 229 AND GLU73 OF THE HYD-5 LARGE SUBUNIT WERE FOUND TO BE IMPORTANT IN BOTH HYDROGEN OXIDATION ACTIVITY AND THE OXYGEN-TOLERANCE MECHANISM. SUBSTITUTION OF HIS229 OR GLU73 WITH ALANINE LED TO A LOSS IN THE ABILITY OF HYD-5 TO OXIDIZE HYDROGEN IN AIR. FURTHERMORE, THE H229A VARIANT WAS FOUND TO HAVE LOST THE OVERPOTENTIAL REQUIREMENT FOR ACTIVITY THAT IS ALWAYS OBSERVEDWITH OXYGEN-TOLERANT [NIFE]-HYDROGENASES. IT IS POSSIBLE THATHIS229 HAS A ROLE IN STABILIZING THE SUPER-OXIDIZED FORM OF THE PROXIMAL CLUSTER IN THE PRESENCE OF OXYGEN, AND IT IS PROPOSED THAT GLU73 COULD PLAY A SUPPORTING ROLE IN FINE-TUNING THE CHEMISTRY OF HIS229 TO ENABLE THIS FUNCTION. 2014 THE AUTHOR(S)."
