"1493" "SCANNING ELECTROCHEMICAL POTENTIAL MICROSCOPY (SECPM) AND ELECTROCHEMICAL SCANNING TUNNELLING MICROSCOPY (EC-STM) ALLOW FOR IMAGING THE SOLID-LIQUID INTERFACE UNDER IN SITU ELECTROCHEMICAL CONDITIONS. IN THIS CHAPTER WE TAKE A LOOK AT TWO IMPORTANT ASPECTS OF SECPM AND EC-STM STUDIES: FIRST, INVESTIGATIONS ON MODEL ELECTRODE SYSTEMS RELEVANT FOR ELECTROCATALYSIS ARE PRESENTED. SECOND, STUDIES ON THE BEHAVIOR OF BIOMOLECULES IMMOBILIZED ON ELECTRODES ARE SHOWN. IN BOTH CASES THE USE OF EC-STM OR SECPM ALLOWS FOR INSIGHTS INTO THE ELECTROCHEMISTRY AT A MOLECULAR LEVEL WHICH CANNOT BE ACHIEVED BY OTHER, RATHER INTEGRATING, METHODS.
