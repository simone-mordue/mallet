"1604" "GREGARIOUS SETTLEMENT IN BARNACLE LARVAE (CYPRIDS) IS INDUCED BY A CONTACT PHEROMONE, THE SETTLEMENT-INDUCING PROTEIN COMPLEX (SIPC). THE SIPC HAS BEEN IDENTIFIED BOTH IN THE CUTICLE OF ADULT BARNACLES AND IN THE TEMPORARY ADHESIVE SECRETION (FOOTPRINT) OF CYPRIDS. BESIDES ACTING AS A SETTLEMENT INDUCER, THE PRESENCE OF THE SIPC IN FOOTPRINTS POINTS TO ITS ADDITIONAL INVOLVEMENT IN THE ADHESION PROCESS. SIPC ADSORPTION BEHAVIOUR WAS THEREFORE INVESTIGATED ON A SERIES OF SELF-ASSEMBLED MONOLAYERS (SAMS) BY SURFACE PLASMON RESONANCE AT THE PH OF SEAWATER (8.3). FIBRINOGEN AND A2-MACROGLOBULIN (A2M) (BLOOD COMPLEMENT PROTEASE INHIBITORS WITH WHICH THE SIPC SHARES 29% SEQUENCE HOMOLOGY)WERE USED IN THE ADSORPTION EXPERIMENTS AS POSITIVE AND NEGATIVE STANDARDS, RESPECTIVELY. THE MASS UPTAKE OF THE SIPC WAS COMPARABLE TO THAT OF FIBRINOGEN, WITH ADSORPTION OBSERVED EVEN ON THE PROTEIN-RESISTANT OLIGO(ETHYLENE GLYCOL) SURFACE. NOTABLY, ON THE POSITIVELY CHARGED SAM THE SIPC SHOWED A KINETIC OVERSHOOT, INDICATING A METASTABLE CONFIGURATION CAUSING THE AMOUNT OF ADSORBED PROTEIN TO TEMPORARILY EXCEED ITS EQUILIBRIUM VALUE. A2M ADSORPTION WAS LOW OR NEGLIGIBLE ON ALL SAMS TESTED, EXCEPT FOR THE POSITIVELY CHARGED SURFACE, INDICATING THAT A2M ADSORPTION IS MAINLY DRIVEN BY ELECTROSTATICS. EVALUATION OF SIPC NON-SPECIFIC ADSORPTION KINETICS REVEALED THAT IT ADSORBED IRREVERSIBLY AND NON-COOPERATIVELY ON ALL SURFACES TESTED. 2014 THE AUTHOR(S) PUBLISHED BY THE ROYAL SOCIETY.
