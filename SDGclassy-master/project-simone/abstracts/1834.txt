"1893" "WE AIMED TO INVESTIGATE THE DIAGNOSTIC VALUE OF APPLYING CUT-OFF LEVELS OF INFLAMMATORY MARKERS AND TO DEVELOP A PREDICTION MODEL FOR DIFFERENTIATION BETWEEN BACTERIAL AND VIRAL INFECTIONS IN PAEDIATRIC COMMUNITY-ACQUIRED PNEUMONIA BASED ON C-REACTIVE PROTEIN (CRP), NEUTROPHIL, AND WHITE CELL COUNTS (WCC). AMONGST 401 CHILDREN, THOSE WITH BACTERIAL PNEUMONIA WERE OLDER THAN THOSE WITH VIRAL PNEUMONIA (P< 0.001). COMPARED TO VIRAL, BACTERIAL INFECTIONS HAD A HIGHER MEDIAN CRP LEVEL (P< 0.001), WHEREAS WCC AND NEUTROPHIL COUNT WERE NOT DIFFERENT. BACTERIAL INFECTIONS WERE ASSOCIATED WITH HIGHER CRP >80 MG/L THAN VIRAL INFECTIONS (P= 0.001), BUT LEVELS <20 MG/L WERE NOT DISCRIMINATORY (P= 0.254). RECEIVER OPERATING CHARACTERISTIC CURVE OF THE MODEL FOR DIFFERENTIATING BACTERIAL FROM VIRAL PNEUMONIA BASED ON AGE, CRP, AND NEUTROPHIL COUNT PRODUCED AREA UNDER THE CURVE OF 0.894 WITH 75.7% SENSITIVITY AND 89.4% SPECIFICITY. THIS AETIOLOGICAL DISCRIMINANT PREDICTION MODEL IS A POTENTIALLY USEFUL TOOL IN CLINICAL MANAGEMENT AND EPIDEMIOLOGICAL STUDIES OF PAEDIATRIC PNEUMONIA. 2014 THE AUTHORS."
