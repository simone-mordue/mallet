"1188" "BLOCK COPOLYMERS MADE FROM A POLY(DIMETHYL SILOXANE) (SI) AND A POLY(METH)ACRYLATE CARRYING OXYETHYLENE (EG) OR FLUOROALKYL (AF) SIDE CHAINS WERE SYNTHESIZED AND INCORPORATED AS SURFACE-ACTIVE COMPONENTS INTO A SILICONE MATRIX TO PRODUCE CROSS-LINKED FILMS WITH DIFFERENT SURFACE HYDROPHILICITY/PHOBICITY. NEAR-EDGE X-RAY ABSORPTION FINE STRUCTURE (NEXAFS) STUDIES SHOWED THAT FILM SURFACES CONTAINING SI-EG WERE LARGELY POPULATED BY THE SILOXANE, WITH THE OXYETHYLENE CHAINS PRESENT ONLY TO A MINOR EXTENT. IN CONTRAST, THE FLUORINATED BLOCK WAS SELECTIVELY SEGREGATED TO THE POLYMERAIR INTERFACE IN FILMS CONTAINING SI-AF AS PROBED BY NEXAFS AND X-RAY PHOTOELECTRON SPECTROSCOPY (XPS) ANALYSES. SUCH DIFFERENCES IN SURFACE COMPOSITION WERE REFLECTED IN THE BIOLOGICAL PERFORMANCE OF THE COATINGS. WHILE THE FILMS WITH SI-EG SHOWED A HIGHER REMOVAL OF BOTH ULVA LINZA SPORELINGS AND BALANUS AMPHITRITE JUVENILES THAN THE SILICONE CONTROL, THOSE WITH SI-AF EXHIBITED EXCELLENT ANTIFOULING PROPERTIES, PREVENTING THE SETTLEMENT OF CYPRIDS OF B. AMPHITRITE. 2016 TAYLOR & FRANCIS."
