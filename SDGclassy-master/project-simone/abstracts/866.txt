"981" "MIXED TITANIA/SILICA XEROGELS WERE PREPARED USING TITANIUM TETRAISOPROPOXIDE (TTIP) AND TETRAETHOXY ORTHOSILICATE (TEOS). XEROGEL PROPERTIES WERE MODIFIED BY INCORPORATING N-OCTYLTRIETHOXYSILANE (C8). THE XEROGELS CATALYZE THE OXIDATION OF BROMIDE AND CHLORIDE WITH HYDROGEN PEROXIDE (H2O2) TO PRODUCE HYPOHALOUS ACIDS AT PH7 AND PH8. THE ANTIFOULING/ FOULING-RELEASE PERFORMANCE OF A TTIP/C8/TEOS XEROGEL IN THE PRESENCE AND ABSENCE OF H2O2 WAS EVALUATED FOR THE SETTLEMENT OF ZOOSPORES OF THE MARINE ALGA ULVA LINZA AND FOR THE REMOVAL OF SPORELINGS (YOUNG PLANTS). IN THE ABSENCE OF H2O2, DIFFERENCES IN THE SETTLEMENT OF ZOOSPORES AND REMOVAL OF SPORELINGS WERE NOT SIGNIFICANT RELATIVE TO A TITANIUM-FREE C8/TEOS XEROGEL. ADDITION OF H2O2 GAVE A SIGNIFICANT REDUCTION IN ZOOSPORE SETTLEMENT AND SPORELING REMOVAL RELATIVE TO THE C8/TEOS XEROGEL AND RELATIVE TO PEROXIDE-FREE CONDITIONS. THE IMPACT OF TTIP ON XEROGEL CHARACTERISTICS WAS EVALUATED BY COMPREHENSIVE CONTACT ANGLE ANALYSIS, SCANNING ELECTRON MICROSCOPY, AND X-RAY PHOTOELECTRON SPECTROSCOPY. 2016 INFORMA UK LIMITED, TRADING AS TAYLOR & FRANCIS GROUP."
