"1344" "A WEAKLY-BOUND COMPLEX OF SF<INF>6</INF> AND NH<INF>3</INF> IS GENERATED WITHIN AN EXPANDING GAS JET AND CHARACTERISED BY BROADBAND ROTATIONAL SPECTROSCOPY. THE SPECTRA OF ISOTOPOLOGUES 32SF<INF>6</INF>14NH<INF>3</INF>, 32SF<INF>6</INF>14ND<INF>3</INF>, 32SF<INF>6</INF>15NH<INF>3</INF> AND 34SF<INF>6</INF>15NH<INF>3</INF> ARE OBSERVED AND ASSIGNED TO DETERMINE THE SPECTROSCOPIC PARAMETERS. THESE PARAMETERS ARE CONSISTENT WITH THE COMPLEX HAVING A C<INF>3V</INF> SYMMETRIC ROTOR GEOMETRY, IN WHICH THE NITROGEN ATOM OF NH<INF>3</INF> COORDINATES TO SF<INF>6</INF> SUCH THAT THE C<INF>3V</INF> AXIS OF THE NH<INF>3</INF> SUB-UNIT IS ALIGNED WITH A LOCAL C<INF>3</INF> AXIS ON THE SF<INF>6</INF> SUB-UNIT. THE GEOMETRY OF THE COMPLEX IS RATIONALIZED IN TERMS OF A -HOLE INTERACTION. THE OBSERVED SPECTRA AND AB INITIO CALCULATIONS ALSO REVEAL EVIDENCE OF INTERNAL DYNAMICS INVOLVING INTERNAL ROTATION OF ONE MONOMER SUB-UNIT WITH RESPECT TO THE OTHER ABOUT THE SYMMETRY AXIS OF THE COMPLEX. 2015 WILEY-VCH VERLAG GMBH & CO.
