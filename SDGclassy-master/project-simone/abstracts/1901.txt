"87" "WHILE RADIOLABELLED ANTIBODIES HAVE FOUND GREAT UTILITY AS PET AND SPECT IMAGING AGENTS IN ONCOLOGICAL INVESTIGATIONS, A NOTABLE SHORTCOMING OF THESE AGENTS IS THEIR PROPENSITY TO ACCUMULATE NON-SPECIFICALLY WITHIN TUMOUR TISSUE. THE DEGREE OF THIS NON-SPECIFIC CONTRIBUTION TO OVERALL TUMOUR UPTAKE IS HIGHLY VARIABLE AND CAN ULTIMATELY LEAD TO FALSE CONCLUSIONS. THEREFORE, IN AN EFFORT TO OBTAIN A RELIABLE MEASURE OF INTER-INDIVIDUAL DIFFERENCES IN NON-SPECIFIC TUMOUR UPTAKE OF RADIOLABELLED ANTIBODIES, WE DEMONSTRATE THAT THE USE OF DUAL-ISOTOPE IMAGING OVERCOMES THIS ISSUE, ENABLES TRUE QUANTIFICATION OF EPITOPE EXPRESSION LEVELS, AND ALLOWS NON-INVASIVE IN VIVO IMMUNOHISTOCHEMISTRY. THE APPROACH INVOLVES CO-ADMINISTRATION OF (I) AN ANTIGEN-TARGETING ANTIBODY LABELLED WITH ZIRCONIUM-89 ( 89 ZR), AND (II) AN ISOTYPE-MATCHED NON-SPECIFIC CONTROL IGG ANTIBODY LABELLED WITH INDIUM-111 ( 111 IN). AS AN EXAMPLE, THE ANTI-HER2 ANTIBODY TRASTUZUMAB WAS RADIOLABELLED WITH 89 ZR, AND CO-ADMINISTERED INTRAVENOUSLY TOGETHER WITH ITS 111 IN-LABELLED NON-SPECIFIC COUNTERPART TO MICE BEARING HUMAN BREAST CANCER XENOGRAFTS WITH DIFFERING HER2 EXPRESSION LEVELS (MDA-MB-468 [HER2-NEGATIVE], MDA-MB-231 [LOW-HER2], MDA-MB-231/H2N [MEDIUM-HER2], AND SKBR3 [HIGH-HER2]). SIMULTANEOUS PET/SPECT IMAGING USING A MILABS VECTOR4 SMALL ANIMAL SCANNER REVEALED STARK DIFFERENCES IN THE INTRATUMOURAL DISTRIBUTION OF [ 89 ZR]ZR-TRASTUZUMAB AND [ 111 IN]IN-IGG, HIGHLIGHTING REGIONS OF HER2-MEDIATED UPTAKE AND NON-SPECIFIC UPTAKE, RESPECTIVELY. NORMALISATION OF THE TUMOUR UPTAKE VALUES AND TUMOUR-TO-BLOOD RATIOS OBTAINED WITH [ 89 ZR]ZR-TRASTUZUMAB AGAINST THOSE OBTAINED WITH [ 111 IN]IN-IGG YIELDED VALUES WHICH WERE MOST STRONGLY CORRELATED (R=0.94, P=0.02) WITH HER2 EXPRESSION LEVELS FOR EACH BREAST CANCER TYPE DETERMINED BY WESTERN BLOT AND IN VITRO SATURATION BINDING ASSAYS, BUT NOT NON-NORMALISED UPTAKE VALUES. NORMALISED INTRATUMOURAL DISTRIBUTION OF [ 89 ZR]ZR-TRASTUZUMAB CORRELATED WELL WITH INTRATUMOURAL HETEROGENEITY HER2 EXPRESSION. 2019 THE AUTHORS" "DUAL-ISOTOPE IMAGING ALLOWS IN VIVO IMMUNOHISTOCHEMISTRY USING RADIOLABELLED ANTIBODIES IN TUMOURS" "ANTIBODY; DUAL-ISOTOPE; HER2; MOLECULAR IMAGING; PET; SPECT"
