"295" "IN THIS WORK, THE AUTHORS EXPLORE THE SODIUM SALT OF THE 14-VANADO(V)PHOSPHATE, NA7[H2PV14O42], AS A POTENTIAL ANODE MATERIAL FOR SODIUM-ION BATTERIES (NIBS). THE MULTI-ELECTRON REDOX ACTIVITY OF THE POLYOXOVANADATE [H2PV14O42]7-LEADS TO HIGH CAPACITY. THIS POLYANION IS SYNTHESIZED BY A SIMPLE AQUEOUS SOLUTION PROCEDURE AND ISOLATE AS A SODIUM SALT WITH DIFFERENT NUMBERS OF CRYSTAL WATERS, NA7[H2PV14O42]NH2O (N=1524). NA7[H2PV14O42] AS ANODE IN NIBS EXHIBITS A HIGH AND REVERSIBLE CAPACITY OF 322 MA H G1 AT 25 MA G1 WITH A HIGH CYCLING STABILITY (WITH CAPACITY RETENTION OF 87% AFTER 120 CYCLES). SOME OF THE V5+ IONS IN [H2PV14O42]7- CAN BE REDUCED TO V3+ AFTER BEING DISCHARGED TO 0.01 V VERSUS NA/NA+, RESULTING IN AN AVERAGE OXIDATION STATE OF V3.7+, AS BASED ON EX SITU X-RAY PHOTOELECTRON SPECTROSCOPY AND IN SITU SYNCHROTRON X-RAY ABSORPTION NEAR EDGE STRUCTURE STUDIES. THE CRYSTALLINE MATERIAL BECOMES AMORPHOUS DURING THE CHARGE/DISCHARGE PROCESSES, WHICH CAN BE OBSERVED BY IN SITU SYNCHROTRON X-RAY DIFFRACTION, INDICATING THAT FUNCTIONALITY DOES NOT REQUIRE CRYSTALLINITY. THE AUTHORS PROPOSE THAT THE CHARGE STORAGE MECHANISM OF NA7[H2PV14O42] ANODES MAINLY INVOLVES REDOX REACTIONS OF V ACCOMPANIED BY INSERTION/EXTRACTION OF NA IONS IN-BETWEEN POLYOXO-14-VANADATE IONS AND ADSORPTION/DESORPTION OF NA IONS ON THE SURFACE OF THE VANADATE MATERIAL. 2018 WILEY-VCH VERLAG GMBH & CO.
