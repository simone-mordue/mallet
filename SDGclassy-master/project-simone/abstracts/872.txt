"125" "MODIFICATIONS IN CELL WALL COMPOSITION, WHICH CAN BE ACCOMPANIED BY CHANGES IN ITS STRUCTURE, WERE ALREADY REPORTED DURING PLANT INTERACTIONS WITH OTHER ORGANISMS, SUCH AS THE MYCORRHIZAL FUNGI. ARBUSCULAR MYCORRHIZAL (AM) FUNGI ARE AMONG THE MOST WIDESPREAD SOIL ORGANISMS THAT COLONIZE THE ROOTS OF LAND PLANTS, WHERE THEY FACILITATE MINERAL NUTRIENT UPTAKE FROM THE SOIL IN EXCHANGE FOR PLANT-ASSIMILATED CARBON. IN AM SYMBIOSIS, THE HOST PLASMA MEMBRANE INVAGINATES AND PROLIFERATES AROUND ALL THE DEVELOPING INTRACELLULAR FUNGAL STRUCTURES, AND CELL WALL MATERIAL IS LAID DOWN BETWEEN THIS MEMBRANE AND THE FUNGAL CELL SURFACE. IN ADDITION, TO IMPROVE HOST NUTRITION AND TOLERANCE/RESISTANCE TO ENVIRONMENTAL STRESSES, AM SYMBIOSIS WAS SHOWN TO MODULATE FRUIT FEATURES. IN THIS STUDY, COMPREHENSIVE MICROARRAY POLYMER PROFILING (COMMP) TECHNIQUE WAS USED TO VERIFY THE IMPACT OF THE AM SYMBIOSIS ON THE TOMATO CELL WALL COMPOSITION BOTH AT LOCAL (ROOT) AND SYSTEMIC LEVEL (FRUIT). MULTIVARIATE DATA ANALYSES WERE PERFORMED ON THE OBTAINED DATASETS LOOKING FOR THE EFFECTS OF FERTILIZATION, INOCULATION WITH AM FUNGI, AND THE FRUIT RIPENING STAGE. RESULTS ALLOWED FOR THE DISCERNMENT OF CELL WALL COMPONENT MODIFICATIONS THAT WERE CORRELATED WITH MYCORRHIZAL COLONIZATION, SHOWING A DIFFERENT TOMATO RESPONSE TO AM COLONIZATION AND HIGH FERTILIZATION, BOTH AT THE ROOT AND THE SYSTEMIC LEVEL. 2019 BY THE AUTHORS.
