"1243" "SINCE ITS CONCEPTION, DNA BARCODING HAS SEEN A RAPID UPTAKE WITHIN THE RESEARCH COMMUNITY. NEVERTHELESS, AS WITH MANY NEW SCIENTIFIC TOOLS, PROGRESSION TOWARDS THE POINT OF ROUTINE DEPLOYMENT WITHIN DIAGNOSTIC LABORATORIES HAS BEEN SLOW. IN THIS PAPER, WE DISCUSS THE APPLICATION OF DNA BARCODING IN THE DEFRA PLANT HEALTH DIAGNOSTIC LABORATORIES, WHERE DNA BARCODING IS USED PRIMARILY FOR THE IDENTIFICATION OF INVERTEBRATE PESTS. WE PRESENT A SERIES OF CASE STUDIES THAT DEMONSTRATE THE SUCCESSFUL APPLICATION OF DNA BARCODING BUT ALSO REVEAL SOME POTENTIAL LIMITATIONS TO EXPANDED USE. THE REGULATED PLANT PEST, BURSEPHALENCHUS XYLOPHILUS, AND ONE OF ITS VECTORS, MONOCHAMUS ALTERNATUS, WERE FOUND IN DINING CHAIRS. SOME TRADED WOOD PRODUCTS ARE POTENTIALLY HIGH RISK, ALLOWING THE MOVEMENT OF LONGHORN BEETLES, TRICHOFERUS CAMPESTRIS, LEPTURA QUADRIFASCIATA, AND TRICHOFERUS HOLOSERICEUS WERE FOUND IN A WOODEN CUTLERY TRAY, A RAILWAY SLEEPER, AND A DINING CHAIR, RESPECTIVELY. AN OUTBREAK OF MELOIDOGYNE FALLAX WAS IDENTIFIED IN ALLIUM AMPELOPRASUM AND IN THREE WEED SPECIES. REFERENCE SEQUENCES FOR UK NATIVE PSYLLIDS WERE GENERATED TO ENABLE THE DEVELOPMENT OF RAPID DIAGNOSTICS TO BE USED FOR MONITORING FOLLOWING THE RELEASE OF APHALARA ITADORI AS A BIOLOGICAL CONTROL AGENT FOR FALLOPIA JAPONICA. 2016 PUBLISHED BY NRC RESEARCH PRESS."
