"253" "THE PANAMA BASIN SERVES AS A LABORATORY TO INVESTIGATE ABYSSAL WATER UPWELLING. THE BASIN HAS ONLY A SINGLE ABYSSAL WATER INFLOW PATHWAY THROUGH THE NARROW ECUADOR TRENCH. THE ESTIMATED CRITICAL INFLOW THROUGH THE TRENCH REACHES 0.340.07M/S, RESULTING IN AN ABYSSAL WATER VOLUME INFLOW OF 0.290.07SV. THE SAME TRENCH CARRIES THE RETURN FLOW OF BASIN WATERS THAT STARTS JUST 200M ABOVE THE BOTTOM AND IS APPROXIMATELY 400-M DEEPER THAN THE DEPTH OF THE NEXT POSSIBLE DEEP WATER EXCHANGE PATHWAY AT THE CARNEGIE RIDGE SADDLE. THE CURVATURE OF TEMPERATURE-SALINITY DIAGRAMS IS USED TO DIFFERENTIATE THE EFFECT OF GEOTHERMAL HEATING ON THE DEEP PANAMA BASIN WATERS THAT WAS FOUND TO REACH AS HIGH AS 2,200-M DEPTH, WHICH IS ABOUT 500M ABOVE THE UPPER BOUNDARY OF THE ABYSSAL WATER LAYER. 2018.
