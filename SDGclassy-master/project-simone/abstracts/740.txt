"319" "INNOVATIVE PROCEDURES WERE USED TO SELECTIVELY ISOLATE SMALL NUMBERS OF MICROMONOSPORA STRAINS FROM EXTREME HYPER-ARID AND HIGH ALTITUDE ATACAMA DESERT SOILS. MICROMONOSPORAE WERE RECOGNISED ON ISOLATION PLATES BY THEIR ABILITY TO PRODUCE FILAMENTOUS MICROCOLONIES THAT WERE STRONGLY ATTACHED TO THE AGAR. MOST OF THE ISOLATES FORMED CHARACTERISTIC ORANGE COLONIES THAT LACKED AERIAL HYPHAE AND TURNED BLACK ON SPORE FORMATION, WHEREAS THOSE FROM THE HIGH ALTITUDE SOIL WERE DRY, BLUE-GREEN AND COVERED BY WHITE AERIAL HYPHAE. THE ISOLATES WERE ASSIGNED TO SEVEN MULTI- AND ELEVEN SINGLE-MEMBERED GROUPS BASED ON BOX-PCR PROFILES. REPRESENTATIVES OF THE GROUPS WERE ASSIGNED TO EITHER MULTI-MEMBERED CLADES THAT ALSO CONTAINED MARKER STRAINS OR FORMED DISTINCT PHYLETIC LINES IN THE MICROMONOSPORA 16S RRNA GENE TREE, MANY OF THE ISOLATES WERE CONSIDERED TO BE PUTATIVELY NOVEL SPECIES OF MICROMONOSPORA. MOST OF THE ISOLATES FROM THE HIGH ALTITUDE SOILS SHOWED ACTIVITY AGAINST WILD TYPE STRAINS OF BACILLUS SUBTILIS AND PSEUDOMONAS FLUORESCENS WHILE THOSE FROM THE RHIZOSPHERE OF PARASTREPHIA QUADRANGULARES AND FROM THE LOMAS BAYAS HYPER-ARID SOIL SHOWED RESISTANCE TO UV RADIATION. 2018, SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG, PART OF SPRINGER NATURE."
