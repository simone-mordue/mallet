"411" "PURPOSE: DESPITE ITS WIDESPREAD USE, THE POSITRON EMISSION TOMOGRAPHY (PET) RADIOTRACER 2-DEOXY-2-[18F]FLUORO-D-GLUCOSE ([18F]FDG) HAS BEEN SHOWN IN CLINICAL SETTINGS TO BE INEFFECTIVE FOR IMPROVING EARLY DIAGNOSIS OF PANCREATIC DUCTAL ADENOCARCINOMA (PDAC). A PROMISING BIOMARKER FOR PDAC DETECTION IS THE TIGHT JUNCTION PROTEIN CLAUDIN-4. THE PURPOSE OF THIS STUDY WAS TO EVALUATE A NEW SINGLE-PHOTON EMISSION COMPUTED TOMOGRAPHY (SPECT) IMAGING AGENT, [111IN]ANTI-CLAUDIN-4 MAB, WITH REGARD TO ITS ABILITY TO ALLOW VISUALISATION OF CLAUDIN-4 IN A XENOGRAFT AND A GENETICALLY ENGINEERED MOUSE MODEL OF PDAC. PROCEDURES: THE ABILITY OF [111IN]ANTI-CLAUDIN-4 MAB TO SELECTIVELY TARGET CLAUDIN-4 WAS ASSESSED USING TWO HUMAN XENOGRAFT TUMOUR MODELS WITH DIFFERENTIAL CLAUDIN-4 STATUS IN MICE. [111IN]ANTI-CLAUDIN-4 MAB WAS ALSO USED TO DETECT PDAC DEVELOPMENT IN GENETICALLY ENGINEERED KPC MICE. THE PDAC STATUS OF THESE MICE WAS CONFIRMED WITH [18F]FDG-PET, MAGNETIC RESONANCE IMAGING (MRI), HISTOLOGY, AND IMMUNOFLUORESCENCE MICROSCOPY. RESULTS: HIGH UPTAKE OF [111IN]ANTI-CLAUDIN-4 MAB WAS OBSERVED IN PDAC XENOGRAFTS IN MICE, REACHING 16.94.5% OF INJECTED DOSE PER GRAM (% ID/G) AT 72H POST-INJECTION. THIS UPTAKE WAS MEDIATED SPECIFICALLY BY THE EXPRESSION OF CLAUDIN-4. UPTAKE OF [111IN]ANTI-CLAUDIN-4 MAB ALSO ENABLED CLEAR VISUALISATION OF SPONTANEOUS PDAC FORMATION IN KPC MICE. CONCLUSIONS: [111IN]ANTI-CLAUDIN-4 MAB ALLOWS NON-INVASIVE DETECTION OF CLAUDIN-4 UPREGULATION DURING DEVELOPMENT OF PDAC AND COULD POTENTIALLY BE USED TO AID IN THE EARLY DETECTION AND CHARACTERISATION OF THIS MALIGNANCY. 2017, THE AUTHOR(S)."
