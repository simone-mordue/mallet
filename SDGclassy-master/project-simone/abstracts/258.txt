"1948" "BACKGROUND: DOUBLE-BLIND PLACEBO CONTROLLED FOOD CHALLENGE (DBPCFC) IS THE GOLD STANDARD DIAGNOSTIC TEST IN FOOD ALLERGY BECAUSE IT MINIMIZES DIAGNOSTIC BIAS. OBJECTIVE: TO INVESTIGATE THE POTENTIAL EFFECT OF DIAGNOSIS ON THE SOCIOECONOMIC COSTS OF FOOD ALLERGY. METHODS: A PROSPECTIVE LONGITUDINAL COST ANALYSIS STUDY WAS CONDUCTED IN SPAIN AND POLAND WITHIN THE EUROPREVALL PROJECT. FOOD-ALLERGIC PATIENTS WERE ENROLLED INTO THE STUDY AND IN ALL CASES DIAGNOSIS WAS CONFIRMED THROUGH A STANDARDIZED DBPCFC. DATA WERE COLLECTED THROUGH A SELF-ADMINISTERED SURVEY ON ALL ASPECTS OF HEALTH AND SOCIAL CARE RESOURCE USE, COSTS OF LIVING, AND COSTS OF LEISURE ACTIVITIES. COSTS WERE MEASURED BEFORE AND 6 MONTHS AFTER THE DBPCFC AND REPORTED IN INTERNATIONAL DOLLARS WITH 2007 AS THE BENCHMARK YEAR. RESULTS: FORTY-TWO PATIENTS WERE ENROLLED. TWENTY-ONE PATIENTS HAD A NEGATIVE DBPCFC AND THE SUSPECTED FOOD WAS REINTRODUCED INTO THEIR DIET. COMPARING TOTAL DIRECT COSTS BEFORE AND AFTER THE DBPCFC, THE REACTIVE GROUP SPENT A SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER AMOUNT (MEDIAN INCREASE OF $813.1 OVER BASELINE), WHILE THE TOLERANT GROUPS SPENDING DECREASED BY A MEDIAN OF $87.3 (P=.031). THE AMOUNT OF MONEY SPENT ON FOOD 6 MONTHS AFTER DIAGNOSIS WAS ALSO SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER IN THE REACTIVE GROUP (P=.040). FINALLY, A LARGER, BUT NOT STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT, DECREASE IN TOTAL INDIRECT COSTS WAS OBSERVED IN THE TOLERANT GROUP COMPARED WITH THE REACTIVE GROUP ($538.3 VS $32.3). CONCLUSION: DBPCFC HAS AN IMPACT ON INDIRECT AND DIRECT COSTS OF LIVING. THE MAIN CONTRIBUTION TO THIS INCREASE WAS MONEY SPENT ON FOOD. 2014 ESMON PUBLICIDAD."
