"1668" "THIS PAPER CONSIDERS HOW AGRI-ENVIRONMENT SCHEMES UNDER THE COMMON AGRICULTURAL POLICY COULD BE ADAPTED TO DERIVE A HIGHER RETURN OF ECOSYSTEM SERVICES, BY SPATIALLY TARGETING THE SERVICES MOST VALUED BY SOCIETY AND PROVIDING INCENTIVES FOR CROSS-BOUNDARY MANAGEMENT OF CERTAIN ECOSYSTEM SERVICES AT CATCHMENT OR WIDER SPATIAL SCALES. THE PAPER REVIEWS EVIDENCE THAT SPATIALLY TARGETED, OUTCOME-BASED PAYMENTS MAY BE MORE ECONOMICALLY EFFICIENT THAN CURRENT APPROACHES, BUT IDENTIFIES A NUMBER OF CHALLENGES, INCLUDING: SCIENTIFIC UNCERTAINTY, PRICING OF ECOSYSTEM SERVICES, TIMING OF PAYMENTS, INCREASED RISK TO LAND MANAGERS, COMPLIANCE WITH WORLD TRADE ORGANISATION REGULATIONS, AND BARRIERS TO CROSS-BOUNDARY COLLABORATION IN THE MANAGEMENT OF ECOSYSTEM SERVICES AT HABITAT, CATCHMENT OR LANDSCAPE SCALES. OPTIONS ARE REVIEWED TO OVERCOME THESE CHALLENGES, INCLUDING: THE USE OF PRESSURE-RESPONSE FUNCTIONS AND MODELLING APPROACHES TO ESTABLISH CAUSAL LINKS BETWEEN MANAGEMENT AND ECOSYSTEM SERVICE DELIVERY AND REDUCE THE COSTS OF MONITORING, NON-MARKET VALUATION TECHNIQUES TO SET PRICES FOR ECOSYSTEM SERVICE DELIVERY, INSURANCE SCHEMES, COMBINING FUNDING FROM PUBLIC AND PRIVATE PAYMENT FOR ECOSYSTEM SERVICE SCHEMES, AND OPTIONS TO FACILITATE CROSS-BOUNDARY MANAGEMENT OF ECOSYSTEM SERVICES. USING EXAMPLES FROM UK PEATLANDS AND THE WELSH GLASTIR AGRI-ENVIRONMENT SCHEME, THE PAPER SUGGESTS WAYS TO LINK PAYMENTS FOR MANAGEMENT INPUTS MORE EFFECTIVELY TO THE PROVISION OF ECOSYSTEM SERVICES. 2014 ELSEVIER B.V."
