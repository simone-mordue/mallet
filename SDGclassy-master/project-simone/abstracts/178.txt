"769" "AMPHIPHILIC SILOXANEPOLYURETHANE (AMSIPU) COATINGS WERE PREPARED USING A SERIES OF POLYISOCYANATE PREPOLYMERS MODIFIED WITH POLYDIMETHYL SILOXANE (PDMS) AND POLY(ETHYLENE GLYCOL) (PEG). FOULING-RELEASE PERFORMANCE OF THE AMSIPU COATINGS WAS EVALUATED THROUGH LABORATORY BIOLOGICAL ASSAYS USING SEVERAL REPRESENTATIVE MARINE ORGANISMS. FIRST, POLYISOCYANATE PREPOLYMERS WITH COMPOSITIONAL VARIATION IN PDMS AND PEG WERE SYNTHESIZED AND CHARACTERIZED USING FOURIER TRANSFORM INFRARED SPECTROSCOPY (FTIR) AND ISOCYANATE TITRATIONS. THEN, THE PREPOLYMERS WERE INCORPORATED INTO COATINGS. SURFACE WETTABILITY OF THE COATINGS WAS EVALUATED USING CONTACT ANGLE AND SURFACE ENERGY MEASUREMENTS. COATINGS SURFACES WERE ALSO CHARACTERIZED USING ATTENUATED TOTAL REFLECTANCE FOURIER TRANSFORM INFRARED SPECTROSCOPY (ATR-FTIR), X-RAY PHOTOELECTRON SPECTROSCOPY (XPS), AND ATOMIC FORCE MICROSCOPY (AFM). ATR-FTIR AND XPS EXPERIMENTS REVEALED THAT BOTH PDMS AND PEG MOIETIES WERE PRESENT ON THE SURFACE SUGGESTING AMPHIPHILIC CHARACTER. AFM PHASE IMAGES SHOW MICROPHASE SEPARATION. AMSIPU COATINGS SHOW EXCELLENT FOULING-RELEASE PERFORMANCE TOWARD BACTERIA (CELLULOPHAGA LYTICA), THE DIATOMS (NAVICULA INCERTA), AND THE GREEN ALGAE (ULVA LINZA), DEMONSTRATING COMPARABLE OR SUPERIOR PERFORMANCE TO MANY COMMERCIAL AMPHIPHILIC FOULING-RELEASE COATINGS. DESPITE THE INCORPORATION OF HYDROPHILIC PEG, AMSIPU COATINGS SHOW GOOD MACROFOULING RELEASE WHICH IS OFTEN CHALLENGING WITH AMPHIPHILIC COATING SYSTEMS. AMSIPU COATINGS ARE A NONTOXIC AND TOUGH FOULING-RELEASE SOLUTION WITH COMPARABLE PERFORMANCE TO BENCHMARKS IN THE FOULING-RELEASE COATINGS MARKET. 2016, AMERICAN COATINGS ASSOCIATION."
