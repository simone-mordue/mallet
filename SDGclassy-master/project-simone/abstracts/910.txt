"136" "NEW METHODS AND ADVANCED MATERIALS THAT SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCE THE BACKGROUND WHEN COLLECTING SINGLE-CRYSTAL X-RAY DIFFRACTION DATA AT ULTRA-LOW TEMPERATURES USING A CLOSED-CYCLE HELIUM REFRIGERATOR ARE PRESENTED HERE. THESE INCLUDE A MAGNETICALLY CONTROLLED INTERNAL BEAMSTOP AND A SEPARATE INTERNAL COLLIMATOR THAT TOGETHER COMPLETELY REMOVE THE SCATTERING CONTRIBUTION TO THE BACKGROUND FROM THE BERYLLIUM VACUUM CHAMBER. ADDITIONALLY, A NEW RADIATION SHIELD MADE FROM FLEXIBLE GRAPHITE SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCES THE BACKGROUND AND MAINTAINS EXCELLENT THERMAL PROPERTIES. IN COMBINATION THESE IMPROVEMENTS HAVE LED TO A SIXFOLD REDUCTION IN THE AVERAGE INTENSITY AND A 15-FOLD REDUCTION IN PEAK INTENSITY OF THE BACKGROUND OBSERVED FOR DIFFRACTION EXPERIMENTS CONDUCTED WITH A CLOSED-CYCLE HELIUM REFRIGERATOR. MOREOVER, ACCESS TO ULTRA-LOW BASE TEMPERATURES, 2.05 K, HAS BEEN MAINTAINED. THE DESIGN AND IMPLEMENTATION OF THESE METHODS ARE DISCUSSED ALONG WITH A CASE STUDY OF VITAMIN C TO DEMONSTRATE THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE IMPROVEMENTS. 2019 INTERNATIONAL UNION OF CRYSTALLOGRAPHY."
