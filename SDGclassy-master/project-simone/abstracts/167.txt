"223" "ALTHOUGH SOW CONFINEMENT AT FARROWING IS INHERENTLY STRESSFUL, FARROWING CRATES REMAIN IN WIDESPREAD COMMERCIAL USE. SOWS ADAPT TO THEIR ENVIRONMENT, HOWEVER ADAPTATION MAY BE COUNTER-PRODUCTIVE IF THE FARROWING SYSTEM CHANGES. THE CURRENT STUDY OBSERVED THE BEHAVIOUR OF SECOND PARITY SOWS THROUGHOUT FARROWING IN A STRAW PEN SYSTEM TO DETERMINE IF THEIR PREVIOUS FARROWING EXPERIENCE, IN EITHER THE SAME PEN SYSTEM (N=11) OR A TEMPORARY CONFINEMENT CRATE SYSTEM (N=11), AFFECTED CURRENT NEST-BUILDING, FARROWING AND NURSING BEHAVIOUR. DATA WERE ANALYSED USING PROC MIXED, WITH SOW ID AS THE REPEATED SUBJECT. SOWS WHICH PREVIOUSLY FARROWED IN PENS TENDED TO HAVE A HIGHER PRE-PARTUM PEAK NESTING INTENSITY (P=0.081), AND THROUGHOUT PARTURITION EXHIBITED INCREASED LATERAL LYING (P < 0.01), DECREASED VENTRAL LYING (P < 0.001), DECREASED SITTING (P < 0.01) AND A DECREASED FREQUENCY OF DANGEROUS POSTURE CHANGES (P < 0.05). POST-PARTUM, SOWS THAT PREVIOUSLY FARROWED IN PENS HAD A LOWER PERCENTAGE OF SOW-TERMINATED NURSING (P < 0.01), A LONGER AVERAGE DURATION OF SUCCESSFUL NURSING BOUTS (P < 0.05) AND A LOWER FREQUENCY OF SOW-TERMINATED NURSING BOUTS (P < 0.001). SEASONAL EFFECTS WERE ALSO SEEN IN THIS NATURALLY-VENTILATED SYSTEM, BOTH PRE- AND POST-PARTUM, WITH AUTUMN/WINTER FARROWINGS ASSOCIATED WITH MORE PRE-PARTUM NESTING (P < 0.01), A HIGHER PRE-PARTUM PEAK NESTING INTENSITY (P < 0.05), A LONGER AVERAGE DURATION OF SUCCESSFUL NURSING (P < 0.05) AND A HIGHER PERCENTAGE OF NURSING BOUTS ENDING WITH PIGLETS ASLEEP AT THE UDDER (P < 0.05) THAN IN THE SPRING/SUMMER. INDIVIDUAL VARIATION IN PRE-PARTUM NESTING BEHAVIOUR WAS ASSOCIATED WITH DIFFERENCES IN PARTURIENT AND POST-PARTUM BEHAVIOURS. THE RESULTS SHOW THAT THE PRIOR EXPERIENCE OF CONFINEMENT, OR A CHANGE OF FARROWING SYSTEM, SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECTS SOW FARROWING BEHAVIOUR IN FREE FARROWING PENS, WHICH MAY COMPROMISE THE WELFARE OF BOTH SOWS AND PIGLETS. 2018 ELSEVIER B.V."
