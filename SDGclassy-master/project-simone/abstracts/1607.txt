"1234" "THE SYNTHESIS OF LINEAR- AND (16)-BRANCHED -(14)-D-GALACTANS, SIDE-CHAINS OF THE PECTIC POLYSACCHARIDE RHAMNOGALACTURONAN I IS DESCRIBED. THE STRATEGY RELIES ON ITERATIVE COUPLINGS OF N-PENTENYL DISACCHARIDES FOLLOWED BY A LATE STAGE GLYCOSYLATION OF A COMMON HEXASACCHARIDE CORE. REACTION WITH A COVALENT LINKER AND IMMOBILIZATION ON N-HYDROXYSUCCINIMIDE (NHS)-MODIFIED GLASS SURFACES ALLOWS THE GENERATION OF CARBOHYDRATE MICROARRAYS. THE GLYCAN ARRAYS ENABLE THE STUDY OF PROTEINCARBOHYDRATE INTERACTIONS IN A HIGH-THROUGHPUT FASHION, DEMONSTRATED HEREIN WITH BINDING STUDIES OF MABS AND A CBM. 2016 WILEY-VCH VERLAG GMBH & CO.
