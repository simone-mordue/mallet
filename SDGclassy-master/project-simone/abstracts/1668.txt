"835" "THERE IS GROWING INTEREST IN COMPOUNDS CONTAINING FUNCTIONALIZED E=E MULTIPLE BONDS (E=SI, GE, SN, PB) BECAUSE OF THEIR POTENTIAL TO EXHIBIT NOVEL PHYSICAL AND CHEMICAL PROPERTIES. HOWEVER, COMPOUNDS CONTAINING MULTIPLE FUNCTIONALIZATIONS ARE RARE, WITH SCARCITY INCREASING WITH INCREASING DEGREE OF SUBSTITUTION. THE FIRST DITETRELENE R2E=ER2 IN WHICH THE E=E BOND IS SUBSTITUTED BY FOUR HETEROATOMS (OTHER THAN SI) IS DESCRIBED. THE TETRAPHOSPHADISILENE (MES)2P2SI=SIP(MES)22 (7) IS READILY ISOLATED FROM THE REACTION BETWEEN SIBR4 AND [(MES)2P]LI, THE LATTER OF WHICH ACTS AS A SACRIFICIAL REDUCING AGENT. THE STRUCTURE OF 7 IS PRESENTED, WHILE THE BONDING IN, AND STABILITY OF 7 WERE PROBED USING DFT CALCULATIONS. 2017 WILEY-VCH VERLAG GMBH & CO.
