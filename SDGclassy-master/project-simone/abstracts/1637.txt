"1602" "THE VARIABILITY IN MEAN SEA LEVEL (MSL) DURING 1950-2009 ALONG THE NORTHEAST AMERICAN ATLANTIC COAST NORTH OF CAPE HATTERAS HAS BEEN STUDIED, USING DATA FROM TIDE GAUGES AND SATELLITE ALTIMETRY AND INFORMATION FROM THE LIVERPOOL/HADLEY CENTRE (LHC) OCEAN MODEL, THEREBY PROVIDING NEW INSIGHTS INTO THE SPATIAL AND TEMPORAL SCALES OF THE VARIABILITY. ALTHOUGH A RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN SEA LEVEL AND THE OVERTURNING CIRCULATION CAN BE IDENTIFIED (AN INCREASE OF APPROXIMATELY 1.5 CM IN MSL FOR A DECREASE OF 1 SV IN OVERTURNING TRANSPORT), IT IS THE EFFECT OF THE NEARSHORE WIND FORCING ON THE SHELF THAT IS FOUND TO DOMINATE THE INTERANNUAL SEA-LEVEL VARIABILITY. IN PARTICULAR, WINDS ARE FOUND TO BE CAPABLE OF PRODUCING LOW-FREQUENCY CHANGES IN MSL (\"ACCELERATIONS\") IN A NARROW COASTAL BAND, COMPARABLE TO THOSE OBSERVED BY THE TIDE GAUGES. EVIDENCE IS PRESENTED SUPPORTING THE IDEA OF A \"'COMMON MODE\" OF SPATIALLY COHERENT LOW-FREQUENCY MSL VARIABILITY, BOTH TO THE NORTH AND SOUTH OF CAPE HATTERAS AND THROUGHOUT THE NORTHWEST ATLANTIC, WHICH IS ASSOCIATED WITH LARGE SPATIAL-SCALE DENSITY CHANGES FROM YEAR TO YEAR. 2014.
