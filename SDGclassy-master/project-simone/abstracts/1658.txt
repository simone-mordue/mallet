"722" "THERE IS A NEED TO DEVELOP RELIABLE AND COST-EFFECTIVE PRESERVATION TECHNIQUES THAT SUPPORT THE GROWING DEMAND FOR ULVA CULTIVATION. USING COMBINATIONS OF TWO DIMETHYL SULFOXIDE CONCENTRATIONS (DMSO, 10 AND 15%), THREE NON-CRYOGENIC TEMPERATURES (4, 20 AND 80C), AND ONE- AND TWO-STEP COOLING, WE EVALUATED THE EFFECTIVENESS OF SEVEN METHODS FOR PRESERVING ULVA THALLI, GERMLINGS, AND GAMETES FOR PERIODS OF UP TO 184DAYS. PRESERVATION SUCCESS WAS ASSESSED USING POST-THAW REGROWTH AND A PIGMENTATION INDEX. REFRIGERATION AT 4C WITHOUT DMSO SUCCESSFULLY PRESERVED THALLI FOR 184DAYS WITH LITTLE LOSS OF PLANT QUALITY. IN CONTRAST, THE FREEZING METHODS PRODUCED LOW REGROWTH SUCCESS AND POOR QUALITY THALLUS TISSUE, WITH FEW PLANTS SURVIVING BEYOND 30 STORAGE DAYS. FREEZING TEMPERATURES WERE LETHAL TO GERMLINGS AFTER STORAGE FOR ONLY ONE DAY, BUT GERMLINGS PRESERVED AT 4C HAD REGROWTH RATES COMPARABLE TO THALLI PRESERVED UNDER THE SAME CONDITIONS. IN CONTRAST, ULVA GAMETES WERE SUCCESSFULLY PRESERVED AT FREEZING TEMPERATURES FOR 184DAYS ALTHOUGH VIABILITY WAS RELATIVELY LOW (7.018.7% AT 20C AND 3.512.1% AT 80C). GAMETE VIABILITY AT 4C DECREASED FROM 94.744.30% TO 26.123.97% WHEN THE STORAGE TIME WAS EXTENDED FROM ONE TO 184DAYS. DMSO (10%) REDUCED GAMETE VIABILITY BOTH AT 20C AND 80C. WE DEMONSTRATE FOR THE FIRST TIME, THE CONTRASTING RESPONSES OF ULVA THALLI, GERMLINGS, AND GAMETES TO DIFFERENT NON-CRYOGENIC PRESERVATION METHODS. 2017 ELSEVIER B.V."
