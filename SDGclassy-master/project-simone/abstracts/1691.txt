"1330" "THIS CHAPTER DRAWS A LINE IN THE EXAMPLE OF AN ENERGY SYSTEM THAT INCLUDES ELECTROCHEMICAL PROCESSES FROM A SYSTEM DESCRIPTION AND EVALUATION AND THE METHODS TO ANALYZE THOSE TO COMPONENTS, TO MATERIALS AND DOWN TO MOLECULAR FUNCTIONALITY. IT ADDRESSES THE QUESTION OF ORGANIZATION AND HIERARCHY FROM THE POINT OF COMPUTER SCIENCE. THE CHAPTER SHOWS THAT MORE THAN THREE QUARTERS OF THE ANNUAL ELECTRICITY DEMAND CAN BE COVERED BY RENEWABLES PROVIDED AN APPROPRIATE ENERGY STORAGE AND MANAGEMENT EXISTS. FURTHER ON, THE CASE OF AN AUTONOMOUS ELECTRICITY SUPPLY IS ASSUMED BASED ON RENEWABLES. A FUEL CELL SYSTEM IS CONCEIVED THAT IS BASED ON BIOETHANOL OBTAINED FROM BIOWASTE. IN THIS DIRECT ETHANOL FUEL CELL (DEFC), THE CHAPTER DISCUSSES THE OPERATIONAL CONCEPT AND THE MATERIALS. FINALLY, IT ANALYZES THE IMPORTANT ASPECT OF ELECTROCATALYSIS AND ITS CRITERIA FOR THE DEFC. 2015 WILEY-VCH VERLAG GMBH & CO. KGAA. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED."
