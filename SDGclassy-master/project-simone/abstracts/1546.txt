"1872" "THE REACTION OF 1,4-BIS((1H-IMIDAZOYL-1-YL)METHYL)BENZENE (BIB) AND 5-SULFOISOPHTHALIC ACID (SPA) IN A 1:1:1 RATIO WITH ZINC(II) IONS IN WATER PRODUCED A SUPRAMOLECULAR CAGE-LIKE STRUCTURE OF THE COMPOSITION [ZN 2BIB1.5SPA(OH)(H2O)]1.75H 2ON. THE STRUCTURE AS DETERMINED BY X-RAY CRYSTALLOGRAPHY CONTAINS TWO ZINC(II) IONS, ONE ZINC(II) IS FOUR COORDINATE AND APPROXIMATELY TETRAHEDRAL, WHEREAS THE SECOND ZINC(II) IS FIVE COORDINATE AND BASED ON A TRIGONAL BIPYRAMID. THE TWO ZINC(II) IONS ARE CONNECTED BY A 2-HYDROXYL UNIT AND A 2-CARBOXYLATE UNIT. TWO OF THE CENTRAL DI-ZINC(II) MOTIFS ARE COUPLED TOGETHER BY THE BRIDGING 5-SULFOISOPHTHALATE SUBUNIT AND THIS FEATURE EXTENDS ALONG THE A-AXIS. THE 1,4-BIS((1H-IMIDAZOYL-1-YL)METHYL)BENZENE ACT LIKE PILLARS TO CONNECT THE ROWS OF ZINC(II) IONS AS VIEWED DOWN THE C-AXIS. THE CAVITY FORMED SUPPORTS INCLUSION OF WATER MOLECULES AND THE WATER CHANNEL EXTENDS IN ONE DIMENSION THROUGH THE STRUCTURE. THE WATER MOLECULES CAN BE REMOVED ON HEATING TO T=373 K, AND N2-UPTAKE ADSORPTION STUDIES REVEAL THE PORE VOLUME IS 1.8 10-2 CM3 G-1 WITH A TOTAL BET SURFACE AREA OF 51.2 M2 G-1. 2013 ELSEVIER LTD.
