LESS IS KNOWN ABOUT HOW DIVERSITY IMPACTS LEARNING ACROSS THE MINUTES AND HOURS DURING WHICH SENSORY ENVIRONMENTS OF SMALL FORAGING ANIMALS SUCH AS INSECTS MAY VARY DRAMATICALLY. 3. THIS STUDY SHOWS THAT DROSOPHILA MELANOGASTER EXPOSED TO A DIVERSITY OF ODOURTASTE ASSOCIATIONS OVER A FEW MINUTES SUBSEQUENTLY LEARN STANDARD ASSOCIATIVE LEARNING TASKS POORLY. 4. THIS EFFECT IS ROBUST TO VARIATION IN ODOURS USED IN ALL PARTS OF EXPERIMENTS. 5. FINDINGS MAY HAVE AN IMPACT ON AT LEAST THREE MAJOR RESEARCH AREAS IN ECOLOGY: THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN BIODIVERSITY AND ECOSYSTEM FUNCTIONING, THE EVOLUTION OF FLORAL CONSTANCY IN POLLINATORS, AND THE PEST-PROTECTIVE EFFECTS OF MIXED SPECIES CROPS. 2017 THE ROYAL ENTOMOLOGICAL SOCIETY" "ENVIRONMENTAL DIVERSITY CONSTRAINS LEARNING IN DROSOPHILA MELANOGASTER" "BIODIVERSITY; DROSOPHILA; FLOWER CONSTANCY; LEARNING; MIXED CROP; PROACTIVE INTERFERENCE"
