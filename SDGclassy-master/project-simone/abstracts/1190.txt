THIS SHIFT HAS BEEN JUSTIFIED BY THE UK GOVERNMENT AS A MORE EFFICIENT PROCEDURE FOR DELIVERING SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT (SD), WHICH IS THE OVERARCHING OBJECTIVE OF UK ENVIRONMENTAL POLICY. THIS ARTICLE, WHICH IS BASED ON DATA FROM KEY INFORMANT INTERVIEWS AND SECONDARY SOURCES, ANALYSES THE SHIFT TO UNDERSTAND ITS ASPIRATIONS AND THE CHALLENGES FACING IT.
