"1069" "EXPOSURE OF ORGANO-CHLORINE PESTICIDES AS A RESULT OF UTILIZATION OF OKRA AND BRINJAL TO URBAN POPULATION HAS BEEN ESTIMATED IN THIS STUDY. GC-ECD WAS USED FOR QUANTIFICATION OF A-ENDOSULFAN, -ENDOSULFAN, ENDOSULFAN SULPHATE, HCH, GAMMA HCH, DDT AND DDE RESIDUES FROM 180 SAMPLES OF OKRA AND BRINJAL COLLECTED FROM PERI-URBAN FARMING AREA OF FAISALABAD, MULTAN AND GUJRANWALA. QUANTIFICATION OF PESTICIDE RESIDUES REVEALED THAT 280 SAMPLES WERE CONTAMINATED AND 23 SAMPLES SHOWED RESIDUES VALUE HIGHER THAN MRLS. OUT OF 280 CONTAMINATED SAMPLES, 50 SAMPLES WERE CONTAMINATED WITH A-ENDOSULFAN, 48 SAMPLES WITH -ENDOSULFAN,49 WITH ENDOSULFAN SULPHATE, 27 SAMPLES WITH HCH, 33 SAMPLES WITH GAMMA HCH, 34 SAMPLES WITH DDT AND 39 WERE CONTAMINATED WITH DDE. OVERALL, 7.33% SAMPLES OF OKRA AND 6.44% SAMPLES OF BRINJAL CONTAMINATED WITH A-ENDOSULFAN EXCEEDED EU MRL OF 0.05 MG KG-1, 8.67% SAMPLES OF OKRA AND 7.33% SAMPLES OF BRINJAL HAD -ENDOSULFAN RESIDUE LEVEL ABOVE MRL OF 0.05 MG KG-1 AND APPROXIMATELY, 8.67% SAMPLES OF OKRA AND 7.33% SAMPLES OF BRINJAL HAD ENDOSULFAN SULPHATE RESIDUE LEVEL ABOVE MRL OF 0.05 MG KG-1. WHILE, NO SAMPLE OF OKRA AND BRINJAL HAD HCH, GAMMA HCH, DDT AND DDE LEVEL ABOVE MRL OF 0.01, 0.01, 0.05 AND 0.05 MG KG-1, RESPECTIVELY. THIS STUDY MAY BE HELPFUL IN CREATING A DATABASE ABOUT REGIONAL EXPOSURE OF URBAN POPULATION AND FACILITATE IN EVALUATION OF POTENTIAL THREAT AND RISK TO THEIR HEALTH IN DAILY LIFE. 2016, UNIVERSITY OF AGRICULTURE.
