"664" "NANOTECHNOLOGY AND SYNTHETIC BIOLOGY ARE RAPIDLY CONVERGING, WITH DNA ORIGAMI BEING ONE OF THE LEADING BRIDGING TECHNOLOGIES. DNA ORIGAMI WAS SHOWN TO WORK WELL IN A WIDE ARRAY OF BIOTIC ENVIRONMENTS. HOWEVER, THE LARGE MAJORITY OF EXTANT DNA ORIGAMI SCAFFOLDS UTILIZE BACTERIOPHAGES OR PLASMID SEQUENCES THUS SEVERELY LIMITING ITS FUTURE APPLICABILITY AS A BIO-ORTHOGONAL NANOTECHNOLOGY PLATFORM. IN THIS PAPER WE PRESENT THE DESIGN OF BIOLOGICALLY INERT (I.E., \"BIO-ORTHOGONAL\") ORIGAMI SCAFFOLDS. THE SYNTHETIC SCAFFOLDS HAVE THE ADDITIONAL ADVANTAGE OF BEING UNIQUELY ADDRESSABLE (UNLIKE BIOLOGICALLY DERIVED ONES) AND HENCE ARE BETTER OPTIMIZED FOR HIGH-YIELD FOLDING. WE DEMONSTRATE OUR FULLY SYNTHETIC SCAFFOLD DESIGN WITH BOTH DNA AND RNA ORIGAMIS AND DESCRIBE A PROTOCOL TO PRODUCE THESE BIO-ORTHOGONAL AND UNIQUELY ADDRESSABLE ORIGAMI SCAFFOLDS. 2017 AMERICAN CHEMICAL SOCIETY."
