"392" "A NOVEL FRAMEWORK, INTEGRATING DYNAMIC SIMULATION (DS), LIFE CYCLE ASSESSMENT (LCA) AND TECHNO-ECONOMIC ASSESSMENT (TEA) OF A BIOELECTROCHEMICAL SYSTEM (BES), HAS BEEN DEVELOPED TO STUDY FOR THE FIRST TIME WASTEWATER TREATMENT BY REMOVAL OF CHEMICAL OXYGEN DEMAND (COD) BY OXIDATION IN ANODE AND THEREBY HARVESTING ELECTRON AND PROTON FOR CARBON DIOXIDE REDUCTION REACTION OR REUSE TO PRODUCE PRODUCTS IN CATHODE. INCREASES IN INITIAL COD AND APPLIED POTENTIAL INCREASE COD REMOVAL AND PRODUCTION (IN THIS CASE FORMIC ACID) RATES. DS CORRELATIONS ARE USED IN LCA AND TEA FOR HOLISTIC PERFORMANCE ANALYSES. THE COST OF PRODUCTION OF HCOOH IS 0.0150.005 G1 FOR ITS PRODUCTION RATE OF 0.0940.26 KG YR1 AND A COD REMOVAL RATE OF 0.0380.106 KG YR1. THE LIFE CYCLE (LC) BENEFITS BY AVOIDING FOSSIL-BASED FORMIC ACID PRODUCTION (93%) AND ELECTRICITY FOR WASTEWATER TREATMENT (12%) OUTWEIGH LC COSTS OF OPERATION AND ASSEMBLAGE OF BES (5%), GIVING A NET 61MJKG1 HCOOH SAVING. 2018 ELSEVIER LTD" "LIFE CYCLE, TECHNO-ECONOMIC AND DYNAMIC SIMULATION ASSESSMENT OF BIOELECTROCHEMICAL SYSTEMS: A CASE OF FORMIC ACID SYNTHESIS" "CARBON DIOXIDE CAPTURE AND REUSE; CIRCULAR ECONOMY; ELECTROCHEMICAL BIOREFINERY; RESOURCE RECOVERY AND PRODUCTIVITY FROM WASTE; TECHNICAL SYSTEMS FOR POLICY"
