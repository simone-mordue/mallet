"306" "THE DESIGN OF INNOVATIVE AND MORE EFFICIENT AGGREGATION-INDUCED EMISSION (AIE) CHROMOPHORES HAS KEPT A VERY HIGH SCIENTIFIC INTEREST SINCE THE FIRST REPORT ON 2001. AMONG THE POSSIBLE APPLICATIONS, THE FIELD OF THE ORGANIC ELECTROLUMINESCENT DIODES (OLEDS) IS HIGHLY ATTRACTIVE. THIS REVIEW WILL FOCUS ON VERY RECENT DEVELOPMENT IN THE DESIGN OF AIE MOLECULES FOR OLEDS, WITH PARTICULAR ATTENTION ON THE PERFORMANCE OF DIFFERENT EMITTING DEVICES. ANOTHER KEY POINT IS THE DESCRIPTION OF THE NEW CLASS OF AIE LUMINOGENS SHOWING THERMALLY ACTIVATED DELAYED FLUORESCENCE (TADF), WHICH APPEARS AS POSSIBLE SOLUTION TO OVERCOME THE LIMITATION OF FLUORESCENT DYES EMPLOYED IN ELECTROLUMINESCENT DEVICES. 2018 WILEY-VCH VERLAG GMBH & CO.
