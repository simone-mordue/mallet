"562" "A NOVEL, NON-MOTILE COCCOID, GRAM-POSITIVE AND NON-ENDOSPORE FORMING BACTERIUM, DESIGNATED HV14BT, WAS ISOLATED FROM THE RHIZOSPHERE OF THE HALOPHYTE ARTHROCNEMUM MACROSTACHYUM. IT WAS OBSERVED TO BE CATALASE POSITIVE AND OXIDASE NEGATIVE AND ABLE TO HYDROLYSE STARCH. MK-8(H2) WAS IDENTIFIED AS THE DOMINANT MENAQUINONE AND THE MAJOR CELLULAR FATTY ACIDS WERE ANTEISO-C15: 0 AND ISO-C15: 0. THE POLAR LIPIDS COMPRISED DIPHOSPHATIDYLGLYCEROL, PHOSPHATIDYLGLYCEROL AND AN UNIDENTIFIED GLYCOLIPID. THE 16S RRNA GENES SHOWED THE HIGHEST 16S RRNA SEQUENCE IDENTITY WITH K. POLARIS DSM 14382T, K. ROSEA DSM 20447T AND K. TURFANENSIS DSM 22143T. BASED ON THE PHENOTYPIC AND MOLECULAR FEATURES AND DNADNA HYBRIDIZATION DATA, IT IS CONCLUDED THAT STRAIN HV14BT IS PROPOSED TO REPRESENT A NOVEL SPECIES IN THE GENUS KOCURIA, KOCURIA SALINA SP. NOV., WITH THE TYPE STRAIN HV14BT=DSM 28714T=CECT 9229T. 2017 IUMS." "KOCURIA SALINA SP.
