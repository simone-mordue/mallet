"995" "THE TRACHEAL MITE, ACARAPIS WOODI, IS AN OBLIGATE ENDOPARASITE OF HONEYBEES AND A REGULATED PEST IN COUNTRIES WHERE THESE MITES ARE ABSENT. THIS WORK DESCRIBES THE DEVELOPMENT OF A REAL-TIME PCR METHOD FOR DETECTING TRACHEAL MITES IN HONEYBEES. THE REAL-TIME PCR WAS EVALUATED FOR SPECIFICITY, SENSITIVITY AND SPEED TO DETECT A. WOODI, COMPARED TO THE STANDARD MANUAL THORACIC DISC METHOD (TDM). THE ASSAY DETECTED A. WOODI DOWN TO A 1% INCIDENCE LEVEL IN BEES AND 1000 COPIES OF THE TARGET DNA WHEN USING PLASMID STANDARDS. INITIAL TESTING SHOWED NO CROSS-REACTION WITH THE OTHER TWO ACARAPIS SPECIES FROM DIFFERENT GEOGRAPHICAL REGIONS OR WITH OTHER SPECIES OF MITES ASSOCIATED WITH BEES. HOWEVER, DURING EXTENSIVE TESTING OF BEES, A RARE POPULATION OF ACARAPIS EXTERNUS MITE WAS IDENTIFIED THAT DID CROSS-REACT WITH THE ASSAY. DESPITE THIS CROSS-REACTION, THE ASSAY HAS BEEN SHOWN TO BE A USEFUL SCREENING TOOL AND RESULTS ARE RELIABLE IF THE TDM IS USED AS A BACKUP TO SCREEN HIVES WHERE A POSITIVE SIGNAL IS OBTAINED. 2015, INRA, DIB AND SPRINGER-VERLAG FRANCE."
