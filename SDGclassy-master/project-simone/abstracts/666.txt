"614" "HYMENOSCYPHUS FRAXINEUS (ANAMORPH CHALARA FRAXINEA) IS THE ASCOMYCETE FUNGUS WHICH CAUSES ASH DIEBACK, A POTENTIALLY LETHAL DISEASE OF FRAXINUS EXCELSIOR IN EUROPE. ISOLATION AND CULTURING OF H. FRAXINEUS IS TIME CONSUMING AND THERE IS A NEED FOR RAPID, SPECIFIC DIAGNOSTIC TOOLS TO ASSIST IN THE DEPLOYMENT OF APPROPRIATE PHYTOSANITARY MEASURES. LOOP-MEDIATED ISOTHERMAL AMPLIFICATION (LAMP) IS A NUCLEIC ACID AMPLIFICATION METHOD WHICH CAN BE USED FOR ON-SITE DIAGNOSIS. OPTIGENE HAVE RECENTLY RELEASED A KIT FOR RAPID IN PLANTA DETECTION OF H. FRAXINEUS USING LAMP. THE PERFORMANCE OF THE KIT WAS EVALUATED FOR USE IN THE LABORATORY AND IN THE FIELD IN A COMPARISON WITH REAL-TIME PCR, AND THE KIT WAS ALSO VALIDATED ACCORDING TO EPPO STANDARD 7/98. THE ANALYTICAL SENSITIVITY OF THE KIT WAS FOUND TO BE 7PG OF DNA EXTRACTED FROM PURE CULTURE. THE KIT WAS RAPID, WITH AN AVERAGE TIME TO POSITIVE OF 15.5MIN FOR FIELD SAMPLES. A COMPARISON OF REAL-TIME PCR AND LAMP WAS CARRIED OUT IN THE LABORATORY AND IN THE FIELD. THE DIAGNOSTIC SENSITIVITY AND SPECIFICITY OF THE LAMP KIT IN THE LABORATORY WERE 90.2% AND 98.0% RESPECTIVELY, AND 98.3% AND 88.6% IN THE FIELD. POSITIVE AND NEGATIVE PREDICTIVE VALUES AND LIKELIHOOD RATIOS WERE ALSO CALCULATED AND CONSIDERED IN RELATION TO THE PREVALENCE OF THE DISEASE. THE KIT WAS FOUND TO BE A USEFUL DIAGNOSTIC TOOL WHICH CAN BE APPLIED IN THE FIELD. 2017, KONINKLIJKE NEDERLANDSE PLANTEZIEKTENKUNDIGE VERENIGING."
