"326" "THIS CHAPTER SUMMARIZES THE RESEARCH USING QUANTUM NUCLEAR DYNAMICS TO UNDERSTAND THE ROLE OF VIBRONIC COUPLING FOR INTERSYSTEM CROSSING (ISC) AND REVERSE ISC RATES IN TWO MOLECULES WITH IMPLICATIONS TO THERMALLY ACTIVATED DELAYED FLUORESCENCE (TADF). THE CHAPTER DESCRIBES COMPUTATIONAL APPROACHES FOR SIMULATING THE EXCITED-STATE DYNAMICS OF MOLECULES, ACHIEVED USING MODEL POTENTIAL ENERGY SURFACE (PES) AND WAVEPACKET DYNAMICS SIMULATIONS, WHICH ACHIEVE A RIGOROUS TREATMENT OF MOTION OVER THIS EXCITED-STATE SURFACE. IT PRESENTS TWO RECENT EXAMPLES OF USING QUANTUM WAVEPACKET DYNAMICS SIMULATIONS TO REVEAL INFORMATION ABOUT THE FINE DETAILS OF EXCITED-STATE PROCESSES, IN PARTICULAR ISC AND RISC. THE FIRST IS A STUDY OF THE ULTRAFAST RELAXATION IN A PROTOTYPICAL CU(I)-PHENANTHROLINE COMPLEX, [CU(DMP)2]+ (DMP=2,9-DIMETHYL-1,10-PHENANTHROLINE), AS A PROTOTYPICAL EXAMPLE OF THE EXCITED-STATE DYNAMICS OF CU(I) COMPLEXES. IN THE SECOND EXAMPLE, THE CHAPTER ILLUSTRATES THE CRITICAL CONTRIBUTION OF VIBRONIC COUPLING FOR ACHIEVING EFFICIENT RISC WITHIN ORGANIC D-A MOLECULE. 2019 WILEY-VCH VERLAG GMBH & CO. KGAA."
