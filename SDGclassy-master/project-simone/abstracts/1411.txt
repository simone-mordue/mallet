"1006" "THE EXTRACELLULAR-RELATED KINASE 5 (ERK5) IS A PROMISING TARGET FOR CANCER THERAPY. A HIGH-THROUGHPUT SCREEN WAS DEVELOPED FOR ERK5, BASED ON THE IMAP FP PROGRESSIVE BINDING SYSTEM, AND USED TO IDENTIFY HITS FROM A LIBRARY OF 57-617 COMPOUNDS. FOUR DISTINCT CHEMICAL SERIES WERE EVIDENT WITHIN THE SCREENING HITS. RESYNTHESIS AND REASSAY OF THE HITS DEMONSTRATED THAT ONE SERIES DID NOT RETURN ACTIVE COMPOUNDS, WHEREAS THREE SERIES RETURNED ACTIVE HITS. STRUCTURE-ACTIVITY STUDIES DEMONSTRATED THAT THE 4-BENZOYLPYRROLE-2-CARBOXAMIDE PHARMACOPHORE HAD EXCELLENT POTENTIAL FOR FURTHER DEVELOPMENT. THE MINIMUM KINASE BINDING PHARMACOPHORE WAS IDENTIFIED, AND KEY EXAMPLES DEMONSTRATED GOOD SELECTIVITY FOR ERK5 OVER P38 KINASE. 2016 AMERICAN CHEMICAL SOCIETY."
