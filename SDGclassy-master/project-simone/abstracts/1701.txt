"1505" "THIS PAPER EXPLORES THE ONTOLOGICAL DIFFERENCES BETWEEN TERRESTRIAL AND MARINE ENVIRONMENTS FROM A SPATIAL PERSPECTIVE AND REFLECTS ON THE USEFULNESS OF THE APPLICATION OF ESTABLISHED IDEAS OF TERRESTRIAL SPATIAL PLANNING IN MARINE SPATIAL PLANNING, USING THE UK SYSTEM AS THE MAIN REFERENCE. THROUGH A CRITICAL REVIEW OF THE LITERATURE AN ANALYTICAL FRAMEWORK IS DEVELOPED THAT IS INFORMED BY FOUR INTERLINKED DEFICIENCIES, NAMELY DISCIPLINARY, CONCEPTUAL, LEGITIMACY AND KNOWLEDGE DEFICITS. THE PAPER PROVIDES TWO MAIN CONCLUSIONS. FIRST, AS A DISCIPLINE AND PROFESSION, PLANNING MUST REASSESS THE SUITABILITY OF PRESENT APPROACHES TO MARINE SPATIAL PLANNING AND PROVIDE INNOVATIVE THINKING TO A COMPLEX AND DIFFERENT POTENTIAL AREA OF PLANNING THEORY AND PRACTICE. SECOND, THAT MARINE SPATIAL PLANNING SHOULD DEVELOP ITS OWN RESPONSES TO THE PARTICULAR NEEDS OF THE MARINE ENVIRONMENT AND TAKE INTO CONSIDERATION INFLUENCES FROM VARIOUS DISCIPLINES AND PERSPECTIVES TO ENSURE APPROPRIATE AND ADEQUATE CONSIDERATION OF MARINE-BASED CONCERNS. 2015, THE AUTHOR(S) 2015."
