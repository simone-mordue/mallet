"1343" "IN THIS REVIEW WE WILL CONSIDER THE DEVELOPMENTS IN THE FIELD OF PRIMARY PHOSPHINE CHEMISTRY OVER THE PAST 10 YEARS. A SIGNIFICANT SECTION IS DEVOTED TO THE NUMBER OF NEWLY DEVELOPED AIR-STABLE PRIMARY PHOSPHINES, AND A DFT-BASED MODEL WILL BE PRESENTED WHICH AIMS TO RATIONALISE THE OXIDATIVE RESISTANCE OF CERTAIN PRIMARY PHOSPHINES. CHIRAL AND FLUORESCENT EXAMPLES OF PRIMARY PHOSPHINES WILL BE REVIEWED, ALONG WITH SOME INTERESTING EXAMPLES OF REACTIVITY. FINALLY, A COLLECTION OF COORDINATION COMPOUNDS FROM ACROSS THE PERIODIC TABLE WHICH CONTAIN PRIMARY PHOSPHINES WILL BE HIGHLIGHTED. 2015 ELSEVIER B.V.."
