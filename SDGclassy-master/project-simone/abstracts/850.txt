"363" "METAL OXIDE NANOPARTICLES ARE WIDELY USED IN INDUSTRIES, AND PEAK LEVEL CAN BE CONFIRMED IN THEIR SURROUNDINGS. IN THE PRESENT STUDY, THE SUB-LETHAL EFFECTS OF CUO-NPS FROM LOW TO HIGH CONCENTRATION AS 0.5 TO 1.5MG/L WERE OBSERVED IN TILAPIA (OREOCHROMIS MOSSAMBICUS). ACCUMULATION OF COPPER FROM CUO-NPS WAS INCREASED WITH THE INCREASE IN DOSES, AND MAXIMUM ACCUMULATION WAS FOUND IN THE GILL THAN LIVER AND MUSCLES. THE INCREASED LIPID PEROXIDATION LEVEL WAS OBSERVED IN THE GILL AS COMPARED TO LIVER, AND THE SIMILAR RESULTS WERE OBTAINED IN CATALASE AND GLUTATHIONE WHILE SUPEROXIDE DISMUTASE LEVEL WAS HIGHER IN THE LIVER THAN GILLS. IN HISTOLOGICAL ALTERATIONS, GILL EDEMA, CURVED TIPS, FUSION OF GILL LAMELLAE, AND THICKENING OF PRIMARY AND SECONDARY GILL LAMELLAE WERE OBSERVED. NECROSIS AND APOPTOSIS WITH CONDENSED NUCLEAR BODIES AND PYKNOTIC NUCLEI WERE OBSERVED IN THE LIVER AT THE HIGHEST DOSE CONCENTRATION. IN A GENOTOXIC STUDY, THE HIGHEST VALUE OF % TAIL DNA AND OLIVE TAIL MOVEMENT WAS OBSERVED WITH INCREASING CONCENTRATIONS. COPPER OXIDE NANOPARTICLES HAS GREATER POTENTIAL TO ACCUMULATE IN THE SOFT TISSUES, WHICH MAY CAUSE RESPIRATORY DISTRESS SUCH AS OXIDATIVE STRESS, INDUCTION OF ANTIOXIDANT DEFENSE BY RAISING GLUTATHIONE, ORGAN PATHOLOGY, AND GENOTOXICITY. 2018, SPRINGER-VERLAG GMBH GERMANY, PART OF SPRINGER NATURE."
