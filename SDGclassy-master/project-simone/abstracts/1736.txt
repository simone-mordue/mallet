"350" "THIS STUDY INVESTIGATED THE EFFECT OF, AND INTERACTIONS BETWEEN, US BROWN SWISS (BS) GENETICS AND SEASON ON MILK YIELD, BASIC COMPOSITION AND FATTY ACID PROFILES, FROM COWS ON LOW-INPUT FARMS IN SWITZERLAND. MILK SAMPLES (N=1,976) WERE COLLECTED FROM 1,220 CROSSBREED COWS WITH DIFFERING PROPORTIONS OF BS, BRAUNVIEH AND ORIGINAL BRAUNVIEH GENETICS ON 40 FARMS DURING WINTER-HOUSING AND SUMMER-GRAZING. COWS WITH MORE BS GENETICS PRODUCED MORE MILK IN WINTER BUT NOT IN SUMMER, POSSIBLY BECAUSE OF UNDERFEEDING POTENTIALLY HIGH-YIELDING COWS ON LOW-INPUT PASTURE-BASED DIETS. COWS WITH MORE ORIGINAL BRAUNVIEH GENETICS PRODUCED MILK WITH MORE (I) NUTRITIONALLY DESIRABLE EICOSAPENTAENOIC AND DOCOSAPENTAENOIC ACIDS, THROUGHOUT THE YEAR, AND (II) VACCENIC AND -LINOLENIC ACIDS, TOTAL OMEGA-3 FATTY ACID CONCENTRATIONS AND A HIGHER OMEGA-3/OMEGA-6 RATIO ONLY DURING SUMMER-GRAZING. THIS SUGGESTS THAT OVERALL MILK QUALITY COULD BE IMPROVED BY RE-FOCUSSING BREEDING STRATEGIES ON COWS ABILITY TO RESPOND TO LOCAL DIETARY ENVIRONMENTS AND SEASONAL DIETARY CHANGES. 2018 ELSEVIER LTD" "IMPACT OF US BROWN SWISS GENETICS ON MILK QUALITY FROM LOW-INPUT HERDS IN SWITZERLAND: INTERACTIONS WITH SEASON" "BROWN SWISS; FATTY ACID; LOW-INPUT; MILK; ORIGINAL BRAUNVIEH; SEASON"
