"312" "\"LOCALITY\" IS A FRAUGHT WORD, EVEN WITHIN THE RESTRICTED CONTEXT OF BELL'S THEOREM. AS ONE OF US HAS ARGUED ELSEWHERE, THAT IS PARTLY BECAUSE BELL HIMSELF USED THE WORD WITH DIFFERENT MEANINGS AT DIFFERENT STAGES IN HIS CAREER. THE ORIGINAL, WEAKER, MEANING FOR LOCALITY WAS IN HIS 1964 THEOREM: THAT THE CHOICE OF SETTING BY ONE PARTY COULD NEVER AFFECT THE OUTCOME OF A MEASUREMENT PERFORMED BY A DISTANT SECOND PARTY. THE EPITOME OF A QUANTUM THEORY VIOLATING THIS WEAK NOTION OF LOCALITY (AND HENCE EXHIBITING A STRONG FORM OF NONLOCALITY) IS BOHMIAN MECHANICS. RECENTLY, A NEW APPROACH TO QUANTUM MECHANICS, INSPIRED BY BOHMIAN MECHANICS, HAS BEEN PROPOSED: MANY INTERACTING WORLDS. WHILE IT IS CONCEPTUALLY CLEAR HOW THE INTERACTION BETWEEN WORLDS CAN ENABLE THIS STRONG NONLOCALITY, TECHNICAL PROBLEMS IN THE THEORY HAVE THUS FAR PREVENTED A PROOF BY SIMULATION. HERE WE REPORT SIGNIFICANT PROGRESS IN TACKLING ONE OF THE MOST BASIC DIFFICULTIES THAT NEEDS TO BE OVERCOME: CORRECTLY MODELLING WAVEFUNCTIONS WITH NODES. 2018 BY THE AUTHORS."
