"1074" "SIGNIFICANT INTRAVINEYARD VARIATION IN GRAPE BERRY RIPENING OCCURS WITHIN VINES AND BETWEEN VINES. HOWEVER, NO CELL WALL DATA ARE AVAILABLE ON SUCH VARIATION. HERE WE USED A CHECKERBOARD PANEL DESIGN TO INVESTIGATE RIPENING VARIATION IN POOLED GRAPE BUNCHES FOR ENZYME-ASSISTED WINEMAKING. THE VINEYARD WAS DISSECTED INTO DEFINED PANELS, WHICH WERE SELECTED FOR WINEMAKING WITH OR WITHOUT ENZYME ADDITION. CELL WALL MATERIAL WAS PREPARED AND SUBJECTED TO HIGH-THROUGHPUT PROFILING COMBINED WITH MULTIVARIATE DATA ANALYSIS. THE STUDY SHOWED THAT SIGNIFICANT RIPENING-RELATED VARIATION WAS PRESENT AT THE BERRY CELL WALL POLYMER LEVEL AND OCCURRED WITHIN THE EXPERIMENTAL VINEYARD BLOCK. FURTHEMORE, ALL ENZYME TREATMENTS REDUCED CELL WALL VARIATION VIA DEPECTINATION. INTERESTINGLY, CELL WALL ESTERIFICATION LEVELS WERE UNAFFECTED BY ENZYME TREATMENTS. THIS STUDY PROVIDES CLEAR EVIDENCE THAT ENZYMES CAN POSITIVELY INFLUENCE THE CONSISTENCY OF WINEMAKING AND PROVIDES A FOUNDATION FOR FURTHER RESEARCH INTO THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN GRAPE BERRY CELL WALL ARCHITECTURE AND ENZYME FORMULATIONS. 2016 AMERICAN CHEMICAL SOCIETY."
