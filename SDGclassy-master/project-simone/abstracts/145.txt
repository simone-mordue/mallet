"1335" "AFFORDABLE ENERGY STORAGE IS CRUCIAL FOR A VARIETY OF TECHNOLOGIES. ONE OPTION IS SODIUM-ION BATTERIES (NIBS) FOR WHICH, HOWEVER, SUITABLE ANODE MATERIALS ARE STILL A PROBLEM. WE REPORT ON THE APPLICATION OF A PROMISING NEW CLASS OF MATERIALS, POLYOXOMETALATES (POMS), AS AN ANODE IN NIBS. SPECIFICALLY, NA<INF>6</INF>[V<INF>10</INF>O<INF>28</INF>]16H<INF>2</INF>O IS BEING SYNTHESIZED AND CHARACTERIZED. GALVANOSTATIC TESTS REVEAL A REVERSIBLE CAPACITY OF APPROXIMATELY 276 MA H G-1 WITH AN AVERAGE DISCHARGE POTENTIAL OF 0.4 V VS. NA/NA+, AS WELL AS A HIGH CYCLING STABILITY. THE UNDERLYING MECHANISM IS RATIONALIZED TO BE AN INSERTION OF NA+ IN BETWEEN THE [V<INF>10</INF>O<INF>28</INF>]6- ANIONS RATHER THAN AN INTERCALATION INTO A CRYSTAL STRUCTURE, THE ACCOMPANYING REDUCTION OF V+V TO V+IV IS CONFIRMED BY X-RAY PHOTOELECTRON SPECTROSCOPY. FINALLY, A WORKING FULL-CELL SET-UP IS PRESENTED WITH THE POM AS THE ANODE, SUBSTANTIATING THE CLAIM THAT NA<INF>6</INF>[V<INF>10</INF>O<INF>28</INF>]16H<INF>2</INF>O IS A PROMISING OPTION FOR FUTURE HIGH-PERFORMING SODIUM-ION BATTERIES. 2015 ELSEVIER B.V.
