"532" "INTERACTIONS BETWEEN THE HOST AND ITS MICROBIOTA ARE OF MUTUAL BENEFIT AND PROMOTE HEALTH. COMPLEX MOLECULAR PATHWAYS UNDERLIE THIS DIALOG, BUT THE IDENTITY OF MICROBE-DERIVED MOLECULES THAT MEDIATE THE MUTUALISTIC STATE REMAINS ELUSIVE. HELICOBACTER HEPATICUS IS A MEMBER OF THE MOUSE INTESTINAL MICROBIOTA THAT IS TOLERATED BY THE HOST. IN THE ABSENCE OF AN INTACT IL-10 SIGNALING, H. HEPATICUS INDUCES AN IL-23-DRIVEN INFLAMMATORY RESPONSE IN THE INTESTINE. HERE WE INVESTIGATE THE INTERACTIONS BETWEEN H. HEPATICUS AND HOST IMMUNE CELLS THAT MAY PROMOTE MUTUALISM, AND THE MICROBE-DERIVED MOLECULE(S) INVOLVED. OUR RESULTS SHOW THAT H. HEPATICUS TRIGGERS EARLY IL-10 INDUCTION IN INTESTINAL MACROPHAGES AND PRODUCES A LARGE SOLUBLE POLYSACCHARIDE THAT ACTIVATES A SPECIFIC MSK/CREB-DEPENDENT ANTI-INFLAMMATORY AND REPAIR GENE SIGNATURE VIA THE RECEPTOR TLR2. THESE DATA IDENTIFY A HOST-BACTERIAL INTERACTION THAT PROMOTES MUTUALISTIC MECHANISMS AT THE INTESTINAL INTERFACE. FURTHER UNDERSTANDING OF THIS PATHWAY MAY PROVIDE NOVEL PREVENTION AND TREATMENT STRATEGIES FOR INFLAMMATORY BOWEL DISEASE. HOST-MICROBIOTA INTERACTIONS ARE OF MUTUAL BENEFIT, AND CHRONIC INTESTINAL INFLAMMATION DEVELOPS WHEN THIS DIALOG IS ALTERED. DANNE ET AL. IDENTIFIED A POLYSACCHARIDE PRODUCED BY HELICOBACTER HEPATICUS THAT INDUCES A SPECIFIC ANTI-INFLAMMATORY AND REPAIR PROGRAM IN MACROPHAGES BY ACTIVATING THE TLR2/MSK/CREB PATHWAY. FURTHER UNDERSTANDING MAY PROVIDE PREVENTION AND TREATMENT STRATEGIES FOR IBD. 2017 THE AUTHORS" "A LARGE POLYSACCHARIDE PRODUCED BY HELICOBACTER HEPATICUS INDUCES AN ANTI-INFLAMMATORY GENE SIGNATURE IN MACROPHAGES" "ANTI-INFLAMMATORY GENE SIGNATURE; CREB; HELICOBACTER HEPATICUS; HOST-MICROBE INTERACTIONS; INFLAMMATORY BOWEL DISEASE; MACROPHAGE; MSK1/2; MUTUALISM; POLYSACCHARIDE; TLR2"
