"33" "A GRAM-REACTION-POSITIVE, AEROBIC BACTERIAL STRAIN SHOWING COCCOID CELLS AND DESIGNATED AS BC 501T WAS ISOLATED FROM A BLACK PATINA OF THE SURFACE OF A CARRARA MARBLE BLOCKIN THE GIOIA QUARRY IN TUSCANY, ITALY. A POLYPHASIC STUDY WAS CARRIED OUT TO CLARIFY THE TAXONOMIC STATUS OF BC 501T WITHIN THE EVOLUTIONARY RADIATION OF THE GENUS MODESTOBACTER. PHENOTYPIC AND GENOTYPIC CHARACTERISTICS AS WELL AS PHYLOGENETIC DISTINCTIVENESS CONFIRMED THAT IT REPRESENTS A NOVEL SPECIES OF THE GENUS MODESTOBACTER, FOR WHICH THE NAME MODESTOBACTERITALICUS SP. NOV. IS PROPOSED. THE TYPE STRAIN IS BC 501T (=DSM 44449T=CECT 9708T). EMENDED DESCRIPTIONS OF THE GENUS MODESTOBACTER AND THE SPECIES MODESTOBACTER MARINUS, MODESTOBACTER MULTISEPTATUS, MODESTOBACTER ROSEUS AND MODESTOBACTER VERSICOLOR ARE ALSO PROPOSED." "MODESTOBACTER ITALICUS SP. NOV., ISOLATED FROM CARRARA MARBLE QUARRY AND EMENDED DESCRIPTIONS OF THE GENUS MODESTOBACTER AND THE SPECIES MODESTOBACTER MARINUS, MODESTOBACTER MULTISEPTATUS, MODESTOBACTER ROSEUS AND MODESTOBACTER VERSICOLOR" "DIGITAL DDH; GEODERMATOPHILACEAE; OXIDATIVE STRESS; PHENOTYPING"
