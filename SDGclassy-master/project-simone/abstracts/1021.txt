"686" "POLLICIPES POLLICIPES (CRUSTACEA: SCALPELLIFORMES) IS A HIGHLY PRIZED FOOD IN PORTUGAL AND SPAIN AND CONSEQUENTLY A SPECIES OF CONSIDERABLE INTEREST TO AQUACULTURE. SURPRISINGLY, HOWEVER, LARVAL CULTURE CONDITIONS FOR THIS BARNACLE HAVE NOT BEEN OPTIMIZED. THIS STUDY INVESTIGATED THE EFFECTS OF TEMPERATURE, DIET, PHOTOPERIOD AND SALINITY ON THE GROWTH AND SURVIVAL OF P.POLLICIPES LARVAE. TEMPERATURE HAD A SIGNIFICANT EFFECT ON SPECIFIC GROWTH RATE (2.65.9% TOTAL WIDTH PER DAY, FROM 11 TO 24C), REDUCING MEAN DEVELOPMENT TIME TO THE CYPRID FROM 25DAYS AT 11C TO 10DAYS AT 24C, ALTHOUGH THIS WAS ACCOMPANIED BY A SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN MORTALITY TO OVER 90% ABOVE 22C. MID-RANGE TEMPERATURES (1520C) MAXIMIZED TOTAL SURVIVAL (1931% RESPECTIVELY). ALGAL DIETS OF TETRASELMIS SUECICA, T.SUECICA/SKELETONEMA MARINOI AND S.MARINOI/ISOCHRYSIS GALBANA DID NOT AFFECT SPECIFIC GROWTH RATE SIGNIFICANTLY, BUT SURVIVAL (ON AVERAGE 39% IN 15DAYS) AND THE PROPORTION OF HIGH-QUALITY HEALTHY CYPRIDS WAS SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER ON THE LATTER TWO DIETS (1115% OF INITIAL NUMBER OF LARVAE). PHOTOPERIOD DID NOT SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECT THE SURVIVAL, ALTHOUGH SPECIFIC GROWTH RATE WAS SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER AT 24:0 AND 16:8 L:D. SALINITY (2040GL1 RANGE) DID NOT AFFECT GROWTH AND SURVIVAL SIGNIFICANTLY. THE BEST GROWTH AND SURVIVAL WERE ACCOMPLISHED USING REARING TEMPERATURES OF 1520C, DAILY FEEDING WITH T.SUECICA/S.MARINOI OR I.GALBANA/S.MARINOI AND A PHOTOPERIOD OF 24:0 L:D. 2016 JOHN WILEY & SONS LTD" "EFFECTS OF CULTURE CONDITIONS ON LARVAL GROWTH AND SURVIVAL OF STALKED BARNACLES (POLLICIPES POLLICIPES)" "AQUACULTURE; DIET; LARVAL DEVELOPMENT; PHOTOPERIOD; SALINITY; TEMPERATURE"
