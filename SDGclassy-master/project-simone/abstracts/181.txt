"1901" "AMPHOTERICIN B (AMB) IS THE FIRST-LINE AGENT FOR THE TREATMENT OF LIFE-THREATENING INVASIVE FUNGAL INFECTIONS. THE AIM OF THIS STUDY WAS TO MONITOR AMB IN CRITICALLY ILL SAUDI PATIENTS IN ICU AFTER I.V. ADMINISTRATION OF 0.68 0.1 MG/KG/DAY FUNGIZONE. A SELECTIVE, SENSITIVE AND PRECISE UPLC MS/MS METHOD WAS DEVELOPED TO MEASURE AMB CONCENTRATIONS IN THESE PATIENTS. SEVEN ICU PATIENTS WITH CREATININE CLEARANCE (CLCR) &GT,40 ML/MIN WERE INCLUDED. AMB LEVELS WERE ANALYZED USING A WATERS AQUITY UPLC MS/MS SYSTEM, A BEH SHIELD RP18 COLUMN AND DETECTION VIA ELECTROSPRAY IONIZATION SOURCE WITH POSITIVE IONIZATION MODE. THE PRECISION AND ACCURACY OF THE DEVELOPED UPLC METHOD IN THE CONCENTRATION RANGE OF 200-4000 NG/ML SHOW NO SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE AMONG INTER- AND-INTRA-DAY ANALYSIS (P &GT, 0.05). LINEARITY WAS OBSERVED OVER THE INVESTIGATED RANGE WITH CORRELATION COEFFICIENT, R &GT, 0.995 (N=6/DAY). THE PHARMACOKINETICS OF AMB IN THESE PATIENTS, AT STEADY STATE, SHOWED A HIGH TERMINAL HALF-LIFE OF 124.6 73.4 H, WITH A HIGHEST CONCENTRATION OF 513.9 281.1 NG/ML, A LOWEST CONCENTRATION 316.4 129.0 NG/ML AND A MEAN CLEARANCE 91.1 39.2 ML/H/KG. THE PHARMACOKINETICS OF AMB IN CRITICALLY ILL SAUDI PATIENTS IN ICU WAS STUDIED USING A FULLY VALIDATED ASSAY. A WEAK CORRELATION (R=-0.22) OF AMB CL WITH CLCR WAS OBTAINED, WHICH SUGGESTS THE NEED FOR FURTHER INVESTIGATION IN A LARGER POPULATION. 2014 JOHN WILEY & SONS, LTD."
