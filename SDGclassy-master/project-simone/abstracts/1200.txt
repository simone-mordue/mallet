"1379" "SMALL MOLECULES (XENOBIOTICS) THAT INHIBIT CELL-WALL-LOCALISED ENZYMES ARE VALUABLE FOR ELUCIDATING THE ENZYMES' BIOLOGICAL ROLES. WE APPLIED A HIGH-THROUGHPUT FLUORESCENT DOT-BLOT SCREEN TO SEARCH FOR INHIBITORS OF PETROSELINUM XYLOGLUCAN ENDOTRANSGLUCOSYLASE (XET) ACTIVITY IN VITRO. OF 4216 XENOBIOTICS TESTED, WITH CELLULOSE-BOUND XYLOGLUCAN AS DONOR-SUBSTRATE, 18 INHIBITED XET ACTIVITY AND 18 PROMOTED IT (ESPECIALLY ANTHRAQUINONES AND FLAVONOIDS). NO COMPOUNDS PROMOTED XET IN QUANTITATIVE ASSAYS WITH (CELLULOSE-FREE) SOLUBLE XYLOGLUCAN AS SUBSTRATE, SUGGESTING THAT PROMOTION WAS DEPENDENT ON ENZYME-CELLULOSE INTERACTIONS. WITH CELLULOSE-FREE XYLOGLUCAN AS SUBSTRATE, WE FOUND 22 XET-INHIBITORS - ESPECIALLY COMPOUNDS THAT GENERATE SINGLET OXYGEN (1O<INF>2</INF>) E.G., RIBOFLAVIN (IC<INF>50</INF> 29 M), RETINOIC ACID, EOSIN (IC<INF>50</INF> 27 M) AND ERYTHROSIN (IC<INF>50</INF> 36 M). THE RIBOFLAVIN EFFECT WAS LIGHT-DEPENDENT, SUPPORTING 1O<INF>2</INF> INVOLVEMENT. OTHER INHIBITORS INCLUDED TANNINS, SULPHYDRYL REAGENTS AND TRIPHENYLMETHANES. SOME INHIBITORS (VULPINIC ACID AND BRILLIANT BLUE G) WERE RELATIVELY SPECIFIC TO XET, AFFECTING ONLY TWO OR THREE, RESPECTIVELY, OF NINE OTHER WALL-ENZYME ACTIVITIES TESTED, OTHERS [E.G. (-)-EPIGALLOCATECHIN GALLATE AND RIBOFLAVIN] WERE NON-SPECIFIC. IN VIVO, OUT OF EIGHT XET-INHIBITORS BIOASSAYED, ERYTHROSIN (1 M) INHIBITED CELL EXPANSION IN ROSA AND ZEA CELL-SUSPENSION CULTURES, AND 40 M MYCOPHENOLIC ACID AND (-)-EPIGALLOCATECHIN GALLATE INHIBITED ZEA CULTURE GROWTH. OUR WORK SHOWCASES A GENERAL HIGH-THROUGHPUT STRATEGY FOR DISCOVERING WALL-ENZYME INHIBITORS, SOME BEING PLANT GROWTH INHIBITORS POTENTIALLY VALUABLE AS PHYSIOLOGICAL TOOLS OR HERBICIDE LEADS. 2015 THE AUTHORS.
