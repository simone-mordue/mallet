"1677" "OVER 1.3 BILLION PEOPLE LIVE ON TROPICAL COASTS, PRIMARILY IN DEVELOPING COUNTRIES. MANY DEPEND ON ADJACENT COASTAL SEAS FOR FOOD, AND LIVELIHOODS. WE SHOW HOW TRENDS IN DEMOGRAPHY AND IN SEVERAL LOCAL AND GLOBAL ANTHROPOGENIC STRESSORS ARE PROGRESSIVELY DEGRADING CAPACITY OF COASTAL WATERS TO SUSTAIN THESE PEOPLE. FAR MORE EFFECTIVE APPROACHES TO ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT ARE NEEDED IF THE LOSS IN PROVISION OF ECOSYSTEM GOODS AND SERVICES IS TO BE STEMMED. WE PROPOSE EXPANDED USE OF MARINE SPATIAL PLANNING AS A FRAMEWORK FOR MORE EFFECTIVE, PRAGMATIC MANAGEMENT BASED ON OCEAN ZONES TO ACCOMMODATE CONFLICTING USES. THIS WOULD FORCE THE HOLISTIC, REGIONAL-SCALE RECONCILIATION OF FOOD SECURITY, LIVELIHOODS, AND CONSERVATION THAT IS NEEDED. TRANSFORMING HOW COUNTRIES MANAGE COASTAL RESOURCES WILL REQUIRE MAJOR CHANGE IN POLICY AND POLITICS, IMPLEMENTED WITH SUFFICIENT FLEXIBILITY TO ACCOMMODATE SOCIETAL VARIATIONS. ACHIEVING THIS CHANGE IS A MAJOR CHALLENGE - ONE THAT AFFECTS THE LIVES OF ONE FIFTH OF HUMANITY. 2014 THE AUTHORS."
