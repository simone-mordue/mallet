"1110" "THE HIGH ARCTIC IS DOMINATED BY POLAR DESERT HABITATS WHOSE MICROBIAL COMMUNITIES ARE POORLY UNDERSTOOD. IN THIS STUDY, WE USED NEXT GENERATION SEQUENCING TO DESCRIBE THE - AND -DIVERSITY OF MICROBIAL COMMUNITIES IN POLAR DESERT SOILS FROM THE KONGSFJORDEN REGION OF SVALBARD. TEN PHYLA DOMINATED THE SOILS AND ACCOUNTED FOR 95% OF ALL SEQUENCES, WITH THE PROTEOBACTERIA, ACTINOBACTERIA, AND CHLOROFLEXI BEING THE MAJOR LINEAGES. IN CONTRAST TO PREVIOUS INVESTIGATIONS OF ARCTIC SOILS, RELATIVE ACIDOBACTERIAL ABUNDANCES WERE FOUND TO BE VERY LOW AS WERE THE ARCHAEA THROUGHOUT THE KONGSFJORDEN POLAR DESERT LANDSCAPE. LOWER ACIDOBACTERIAL ABUNDANCES WERE ATTRIBUTED TO CHARACTERISTIC CIRCUMNEUTRAL SOIL PHS IN THIS REGION, WHICH HAS RESULTED FROM THE WEATHERING OF UNDERLYING CARBONATE BEDROCK. IN ADDITION, WE COMPARED PREVIOUSLY MEASURED GEOCHEMICAL CONDITIONS AS POSSIBLE CONTROLS ON SOIL MICROBIAL COMMUNITIES. PHOSPHORUS, PH, NITROGEN, AND CALCIUM LEVELS ALL SIGNIFICANTLY CORRELATED WITH -DIVERSITY, INDICATING LANDSCAPE-SCALE LITHOLOGICAL CONTROL OF AVAILABLE NUTRIENTS, WHICH IN TURN, SIGNIFICANTLY INFLUENCED SOIL COMMUNITY COMPOSITION. IN ADDITION, SOIL PHOSPHORUS AND PH SIGNIFICANTLY CORRELATED WITH A-DIVERSITY, PARTICULARLY WITH THE SHANNON DIVERSITY AND CHAO 1 RICHNESS INDICES. 2016 MCCANN, WADE, GRAY, ROBERTS, HUBERT AND GRAHAM."
