THE COPPER IONS USED BOTH CATALYSE THE REACTION AND PROVIDE A TEMPLATE FOR ENSURING SMOOTH CYCLISATION. THE X-RAY CRYSTAL STRUCTURE OF THE COMPOUND REVEALS THE TWO TRIAZOLE GROUPS ARE NON-COPLANAR WITH THE PYRENE MOIETY. THE TRIAZOLE GROUPS ARE MORE CO-PLANAR WITH THE PYRENE SUBUNIT IN THE FIRST-EXCITED SINGLET STATE AS REVEALED BY A DENSITY FUNCTIONAL THEORY (DFT) CALCULATED MOLECULAR STRUCTURE (B3LYP, 6-311G). PARTIALLY STRUCTURED EMISSION OBSERVED IN ACETONITRILE IS CONSISTENT WITH THE CALCULATION RESULT. IN ACETONITRILE SOLUTION THE MACROCYCLE CPYR INTERACTS WITH A NA + ION TO FORM A COMPLEX IN WHICH THE ION BINDS WITH THE CROWN AND THE PYRENE RESIDUE. 2019 WILEY-VCH VERLAG GMBH & CO.
