"482" "THE DATA REPORTED IN THIS PAPER ARE AMONG THE FIRST RELATING TO THE MICROBIOLOGY OF HYPER-ARID, VERY HIGH ALTITUDE DESERTS AND THEY PROVIDE BASE LINE INFORMATION ON THE STRUCTURE OF ACTINOBACTERIAL COMMUNITIES. THE HIGH MOUNTAIN CERRO CHAJNANTOR LANDSCAPE OF THE CENTRAL ANDES IN NORTHERN CHILE IS EXPOSED TO THE WORLDS MOST INTENSE LEVELS OF SOLAR RADIATION AND ITS IMPOVERISHED SOILS ARE SEVERELY DESICCATED. THE PURPOSE OF THIS RESEARCH WAS TO DEFINE THE ACTINOBACTERIAL COMMUNITY STRUCTURES IN SOILS AT ALTITUDES RANGING FROM 3000 TO 5000M ABOVE SEA LEVEL. PYROSEQUENCING SURVEYS HAVE REVEALED AN EXTRAORDINARY DEGREE OF MICROBIAL DARK MATTER AT THESE ELEVATIONS THAT INCLUDES NOVEL CANDIDATE ACTINOBACTERIAL CLASSES, ORDERS AND FAMILIES. ULTRAVIOLET-B IRRADIANCE AND A RANGE OF EDAPHIC FACTORS WERE FOUND TO BE HIGHLY SIGNIFICANT IN DETERMINING COMMUNITY COMPOSITIONS AT FAMILY AND GENUS LEVELS OF DIVERSITY. 2017, THE AUTHOR(S)."
