"94" "SPIROTETRONATE AND SPIROTETRAMATE NATURAL PRODUCTS INCLUDE A MULTITUDE OF COMPOUNDS WITH POTENT ANTIMICROBIAL AND ANTITUMOR ACTIVITIES. THEIR BIOSYNTHESIS INCORPORATES MANY UNUSUAL BIOCATALYTIC STEPS, INCLUDING REGIO- AND STEREO-SPECIFIC MODIFICATIONS, CYCLIZATIONS PROMOTED BY DIELSALDERASES, AND ACETYLATION-ELIMINATION REACTIONS. HERE WE FOCUS ON THE ACETATE ELIMINATION CATALYZED BY ABYA5, IMPLICATED IN THE FORMATION OF THE KEY DIELSALDER SUBSTRATE TO GIVE THE SPIROCYCLIC SYSTEM OF THE ANTIBIOTIC ABYSSOMICIN C. USING SYNTHETIC SUBSTRATE ANALOGUES, IT IS SHOWN THAT ABYA5 CATALYZES STEREOSPECIFIC ACETATE ELIMINATION, ESTABLISHING THE (R)-TETRONATE ACETATE AS A BIOSYNTHETIC INTERMEDIATE. THE X-RAY CRYSTAL STRUCTURE OF ABYA5, THE FIRST OF AN ACETATE-ELIMINATING ENZYME, REVEALS A DEVIANT ACETYL ESTERASE FOLD. MOLECULAR DYNAMICS SIMULATIONS AND ENZYME ASSAYS SHOW THE USE OF A HIS-SER DYAD TO CATALYZE EITHER ELIMINATION OR HYDROLYSIS, VIA DISPARATE MECHANISMS, UNDER SUBSTRATE CONTROL. 2019 WILEY-VCH VERLAG GMBH & CO.
