"387" "IN SITU FOURIER TRANSFORM INFRA RED SPECTROSCOPY WAS EMPLOYED TO STUDY THE PLASMA GLOW REGION OF A NON-THERMAL PLASMA BETWEEN TWO MACOR DIELECTRICS AND FED WITH CO2, CH4 AND N2. CO, HCN AND FORMALDEHYDE WERE PRODUCED AND RAPIDLY ATTAINED STEADY-STATE CONDITIONS. IN ADDITION, THE CHAIN OXIDES C5O2 AND KETENE WERE OBSERVED (THE FIRST TIME SUCH SPECIES HAVE BEEN SEEN IN THE DRY REFORMING OF METHANE) AND A LIQUID FILM WAS PRODUCED COMPRISING MULTIPLE COMPONENTS, ONE OF WHICH WAS ACETAMIDE. THE DATA WERE INTERPRETED IN TERMS OF CATALYSIS BY THE MACOR DIELECTRIC AND A WHOLLY NOVEL, MULTIZONE MODEL IN WHICH THE LIQUID FILM PLAYS A DIRECT AND IMPORTANT ROLE. THE DATA OBTAINED IN THE PLASMA EXPERIMENTS WERE COMPARED TO AN ANALOGOUS, THERMAL EXPERIMENT. IMPORTANTLY, THE RESULTS FROM THIS WORK COULD HAVE MAJOR IMPLICATIONS ACROSS THE FIELDS OF CATALYSIS, SYNTHESIS AND ORIGIN-OF-LIFE CHEMISTRY. 2018, THE AUTHOR(S)."
