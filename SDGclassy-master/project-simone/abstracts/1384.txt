"945" "THE EFFECT OF INCORPORATION OF SILICONE OILS INTO A SILOXANE-POLYURETHANE FOULING-RELEASE COATINGS SYSTEM WAS EXPLORED. INCORPORATION OF PHENYLMETHYL SILICONE OIL HAS BEEN SHOWN TO IMPROVE THE FOULING-RELEASE PERFORMANCE OF SILICONE-BASED FOULING-RELEASE COATINGS THROUGH INCREASED INTERFACIAL SLIPPAGE. THE EXTENT OF IMPROVEMENT IS HIGHLY DEPENDENT UPON THE TYPE AND COMPOSITION OF SILICONE OIL USED. THE SILOXANE-POLYURETHANE (SIPU) COATING SYSTEM IS A TOUGH FOULING-RELEASE SOLUTION, WHICH COMBINES THE MECHANICAL DURABILITY OF POLYURETHANE WHILE MAINTAINING COMPARABLE FOULING-RELEASE PERFORMANCE WITH REGARD TO COMMERCIAL STANDARDS. TO FURTHER IMPROVE THE FOULING-RELEASE PERFORMANCE OF THE SILOXANE-PU COATING SYSTEM, THE USE OF PHENYLMETHYL SILICONES OILS WAS STUDIED. COATINGS FORMULATIONS WERE PREPARED INCORPORATING PHENYLMETHYL SILICONE OILS HAVING A RANGE OF COMPOSITIONS AND VISCOSITIES. CONTACT ANGLE AND SURFACE ENERGY MEASUREMENTS WERE CONDUCTED TO EVALUATE THE SURFACE WETTABILITY OF THE COATINGS. X-RAY PHOTOELECTRON SPECTROSCOPY (XPS) DEPTH PROFILING EXPERIMENTS DEMONSTRATED SELF-STRATIFICATION OF SILICONE OIL ALONG WITH SILOXANE TO THE COATING-AIR INTERFACE. SEVERAL COATING FORMULATIONS DISPLAYED IMPROVED OR COMPARABLE FOULING-RELEASE PERFORMANCE TO COMMERCIAL STANDARDS DURING LABORATORY BIOLOGICAL ASSAY TESTS FOR MICROALGAE (NAVICULA INCERTA), MACROALGAE (ULVA LINZA), ADULT BARNACLES (BALANUS AMPHITRITE SYN. AMPHIBALANUS AMPHITRITE), AND MUSSELS (GEUKENSIA DEMISSA). SELECTED SILICONE-OIL-MODIFIED SILOXANE-PU COATINGS ALSO DEMONSTRATED COMPARABLE FOULING-RELEASE PERFORMANCE IN FIELD IMMERSION TRIALS. IN GENERAL, MODIFYING THE SILOXANE-PU FOULING-RELEASE COATINGS WITH A SMALL AMOUNT (1-5 WT % BASIS) OF PHENYLMETHYL SILICONE OIL RESULTED IN IMPROVED PERFORMANCE IN SEVERAL LABORATORY BIOLOGICAL ASSAYS AND IN LONG-TERM FIELD IMMERSION ASSESSMENTS. 2016 AMERICAN CHEMICAL SOCIETY."
