"1626" "THE GROWTH OF A PLANT CELL ENCOMPASSES A COMPLEX SET OF SUBCELLULAR COMPONENTS INTERACTING IN A HIGHLY COORDINATED FASHION. ULTIMATELY, THESE ACTIVITIES CREATE SPECIFIC CELL WALL STRUCTURAL DOMAINS THAT REGULATE THE PRIME FORCE OF EXPANSION, INTERNALLY GENERATED TURGOR PRESSURE. THE PRECISE ORGANIZATION OF THE POLYMERIC NETWORKS OF THE CELL WALL AROUND THE PROTOPLAST ALSO CONTRIBUTES TO THE DIRECTION OF GROWTH, THE SHAPE OF THE CELL, AND THE PROPER POSITIONING OF THE CELL IN A TISSUE. IN ESSENCE, PLANT CELL EXPANSION REPRESENTS THE FOUNDATION OF DEVELOPMENT. MOST STUDIES OF PLANT CELL EXPANSION HAVE FOCUSED PRIMARILY UPON LATE DIVERGENT MULTICELLULAR LAND PLANTS AND SPECIALIZED CELL TYPES (E.G., POLLEN TUBES, ROOT HAIRS). HERE, WE DESCRIBE A UNICELLULAR GREEN ALGA, PENIUM MARGARITACEUM (PENIUM), WHICH CAN SERVE AS A VALUABLE MODEL ORGANISM FOR UNDERSTANDING CELL EXPANSION AND THE UNDERLYING MECHANICS OF THE CELL WALL IN A SINGLE PLANT CELL.
