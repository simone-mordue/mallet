"1125" "THE ANAEROBIC DEGRADATION OF 4-ALKYLBENZOATES AND 4-ALKYLTOLUENES IS TO DATE A RARELY REPORTED MICROBIAL CAPACITY. THE NEWLY ISOLATED ALPHAPROTEOBACTERIUM MAGNETOSPIRILLUM SP. STRAIN PMBN1 REPRESENTS THE FIRST PURE CULTURE DEMONSTRATED TO DEGRADE 4-METHYLBENZOATE COMPLETELY TO CO 2 IN A PROCESS COUPLED TO DENITRIFICATION. DIFFERENTIAL PROTEOGENOMIC STUDIES IN CONJUNCTION WITH TARGETED METABOLITE ANALYSES AND ENZYME ACTIVITY MEASUREMENTS ELUCIDATED A SPECIFIC 4-METHYLBENZOYL-COENZYME A (COA) PATHWAY IN THIS BACTERIUM ALONGSIDE THE CLASSICAL CENTRAL BENZOYL-COA PATHWAY. WHILST THESE TWO PATHWAYS ARE ANALOGOUS, IN THE FORMER THE P-METHYL GROUP IS RETAINED AND ITS 4-METHYLBENZOYL-COA REDUCTASE (MBRCBAD) IS PHYLOGENETICALLY DISTINCT FROM THE ARCHETYPICAL CLASS I BENZOYL-COA REDUCTASE (BCRCBAD). SUBSEQUENT GLOBAL REGULATORY STUDIES ON STRAIN PMBN1 GROWN WITH BINARY OR TERNARY SUBSTRATE MIXTURES REVEALED BENZOATE TO REPRESS THE ANAEROBIC UTILIZATION OF 4-METHYLBENZOATE AND SUCCINATE. THE SHARED NUTRITIONAL PROPERTY OF BETAPROTEOBACTERIAL 'AROMATOLEUM AROMATICUM' PCYN1 AND THAUERA SP. STRAIN PCYN2 IS THE ANAEROBIC DEGRADATION OF THE PLANT-DERIVED HYDROCARBON P-CYMENE (4-ISOPROPYLTOLUENE) COUPLED TO DENITRIFICATION. NOTABLY, THE TWO STRAINS EMPLOY TWO DIFFERENT PERIPHERAL PATHWAYS FOR THE CONVERSION OF P-CYMENE TO 4-ISOPROPYLBENZOYL-COA AS THE POSSIBLE FIRST COMMON INTERMEDIATE. IN 'A. AROMATICUM' PCYN1 A PUTATIVE P-CYMENE DEHYDROGENASE (CMDABC) IS PROPOSED TO HYDROXYLATE THE BENZYLIC METHYL GROUP, WHICH IS SUBSEQUENTLY FURTHER OXIDIZED TO THE COA-THIOESTER. IN CONTRAST, THAUERA SP. STRAIN PCYN2 EMPLOYS A REACTION SEQUENCE ANALOGOUS TO THE KNOWN ANAEROBIC TOLUENE PATHWAY, INVOLVING A DISTINCT BRANCHING (4-ISOPROPYLBENZYL)SUCCINATE SYNTHASE (IBSABCDEF). 2016 S. KARGER AG, BASEL."
