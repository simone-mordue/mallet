"1121" "CARBENES OF PLATINUM AND PALLADIUM, PTC3 AND PDC3, WERE GENERATED IN THE GAS PHASE THROUGH LASER VAPORIZATION OF A METAL TARGET IN THE PRESENCE OF A LOW CONCENTRATION OF A HYDROCARBON PRECURSOR UNDERGOING SUPERSONIC EXPANSION. ROTATIONAL SPECTROSCOPY AND ABINITIO CALCULATIONS CONFIRM THAT BOTH MOLECULES ARE LINEAR. THE GEOMETRY OF PTC3 WAS ACCURATELY DETERMINED BY FITTING TO THE EXPERIMENTAL MOMENTS OF INERTIA OF TWENTY-SIX ISOTOPOLOGUES. THE RESULTS ARE CONSISTENT WITH THE PROPOSAL OF AN AUTOGENIC ISOLOBAL RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN O, AU+, AND PTATOMS. WALK THE LINE: PTC3 AND PDC3 CARBENES HAVE BEEN GENERATED IN THE GAS PHASE THROUGH LASER VAPORIZATION OF A METAL TARGET IN THE PRESENCE OF A LOW CONCENTRATION OF A HYDROCARBON PRECURSOR UNDERGOING SUPERSONIC EXPANSION. ROTATIONAL SPECTROSCOPY AND ABINITIO CALCULATIONS CONFIRM THAT BOTH MOLECULES ARE LINEAR. ATOM COLORS: PT=YELLOW, C=BLUE. 2016 WILEY-VCH VERLAG GMBH & CO. KGAA, WEINHEIM."
