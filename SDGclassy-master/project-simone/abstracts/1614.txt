"763" "THE TAXONOMIC POSITION OF AN ACTINOBACTERIAL ISOLATE, DESIGNATED STRAIN BMG 822 T , ISOLATED FROM LIMESTONE FROM THE AMPHITHEATER OF EL JEM (COLISEUM THYSDRUS), TUNISIA, WAS ESTABLISHED USING A POLYPHASIC APPROACH. STRAIN BMG 822 T WAS FOUND TO GROW WELL AT 30C AND PH 6.58.0, AND TO BE CORAL-COLOURED, GRAM-POSITIVE, CATALASE AND OXIDASE NEGATIVE. WHOLE CELL HYDROLYSATES CONTAINED MESO-DIAMINOPIMELIC ACID AS THE DIAGNOSTIC DIAMINO ACID, GLUCOSE, GALACTOSE AND RIBOSE. THE PHOSPHOLIPIDS DETECTED WERE DIPHOSPHATIDYLGLYCEROL, PHOSPHATIDYLCHOLINE, PHOSPHATIDYLINOSITOL, PHOSPHATIDYLETHANOLAMINE, HYDROXY-PHOSPHATIDYLETHANOLAMINE, AN UNIDENTIFIED GLYCOPHOSPHOLIPID AND SIX UNIDENTIFIED PHOSPHOLIPIDS. MK-9(H 4 ) WAS FOUND TO BE THE PREDOMINANT MENAQUINONE, FOLLOWED BY MK-9(H 2 ) AND MK-9. THE MAJOR CELLULAR FATTY ACIDS WERE IDENTIFIED AS ISO-C 16:0 , C 18:1 9C, C 17:1 8C AND ISO-H-C 16:1 . THE G+C CONTENT OF THE DNA (73.2%) IS TYPICAL OF THE GENUS. HIGH DEGREES OF 16S RRNA GENE SEQUENCE SIMILARITY WERE FOUND WITH THE TYPE STRAINS OF THE GENUS BLASTOCOCCUS (97.198.3%) FOLLOWED BY THE TYPE STRAINS OF MODESTOBACTER (96.897.8%). BASED ON THE ABOVE DATA AND THE PHENOTYPIC DIFFERENCES FROM THE TYPE STRAINS OFBLASTOCOCCUS SPECIES, IT IS PROPOSED THAT THE ISOLATE BMG 822 T (=DSM 46837 T =CECT 8823 T ) SHOULD BE CLASSIFIED AS THE TYPE STRAIN OF A NOVEL SPECIES,BLASTOCOCCUS COLISEI SP.
