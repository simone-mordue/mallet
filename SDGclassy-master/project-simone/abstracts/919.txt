"926" "NON-TARGETED APPROACHES ARE USEFUL TOOLS TO IDENTIFY NEW OR EMERGING ISSUES IN BEE HEALTH. HERE, WE UTILISE NEXT GENERATION SEQUENCING TO HIGHLIGHT BACTERIA ASSOCIATED WITH HEALTHY AND UNHEALTHY HONEY BEE COLONIES, AND THEN USE TARGETED METHODS TO SCREEN A WIDER POOL OF COLONIES WITH KNOWN HEALTH STATUS. OUR RESULTS PROVIDE THE FIRST EVIDENCE THAT BACTERIA FROM THE GENUS ARSENOPHONUS ARE ASSOCIATED WITH POOR HEALTH IN HONEY BEE COLONIES. WE ALSO DISCOVERED LACTOBACILLUS AND LEUCONOSTOC SPP. WERE ASSOCIATED WITH HEALTHIER HONEY BEE COLONIES. OUR RESULTS HIGHLIGHT THE IMPORTANCE OF UNDERSTANDING HOW THE WIDER MICROBIAL POPULATION RELATES TO HONEY BEE COLONY HEALTH. 2016" "IDENTIFYING BACTERIAL PREDICTORS OF HONEY BEE HEALTH" "MICROBIOME; PROBIOTIC; SYMBIONT"
