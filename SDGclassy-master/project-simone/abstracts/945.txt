"1796" "ON-SITE TESTING IS A TERM THAT IS OFTEN USED TO DESCRIBE TWO DISTINCT ACTIVITIES, FIRSTLY DETECTION IS THE INITIAL LOCATING OF THE PEST OR PATHOGEN INFECTED SAMPLE WHICH IN MOST INSTANCES IS PERFORMED VISUALLY. THE SECOND ACTIVITY IS IDENTIFICATION, USUALLY THIS IS ACHIEVED BY SENDING SUSPECTED SAMPLES TO A LABORATORY. IN RECENT YEARS THERE HAS BEEN SIGNIFICANT RESEARCH ACTIVITY IN EACH OF THE AREAS TO PROVIDE TECHNOLOGICAL SOLUTIONS TO ENABLE MORE RAPID DECISION MAKING. OF COURSE IT IS NOT NECESSARILY JUST INSPECTION SERVICES WHO BENEFIT FROM THESE TECHNIQUES, THEY CAN BE DEPLOYED THROUGHOUT THE FARM TO FORK, AGRI-PRODUCTION CHAIN BY SEED PRODUCERS, GROWERS, PROCESSORS, PACK-HOUSES ETC. TO LIMIT LOSSES CAUSED BY PATHOGENS AND PESTS. HOW BEST TO DEPLOY DETECTION METHODS HOWEVER MAY PROVIDE A POTENTIAL CONUNDRUM FOR POLICY MAKERS AND OTHER STAKEHOLDERS. DEPLOYING SIMPLIFIED DETECTION AND IDENTIFICATION METHODS REMOTELY HELPS TO SPEED UP INSPECTION AND FACILITATES TRADE. HOWEVER, WITHOUT CARE THIS APPROACH MAY RISK A BLINKERED, TARGETED INSPECTION APPROACH AND A WINDING DOWN OF LABORATORY EXPERTISE WHICH IS NEEDED DURING OUTBREAKS OF NEW PESTS.
