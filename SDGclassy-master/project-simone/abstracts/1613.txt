"284" "THE TAXONOMIC POSITION OF A NOVEL AMYCOLATOPSIS STRAIN ISOLATED FROM A HIGH ALTITUDE ATACAMA DESERT SUBSURFACE SOIL WAS ESTABLISHED USING A POLYPHASIC APPROACH. THE STRAIN, ISOLATE H5T, WAS SHOWN TO HAVE CHEMICAL PROPERTIES TYPICAL OF MEMBERS OF THE GENUS AMYCOLATOPSIS SUCH AS MESO-DIAMINOPIMELIC ACID AS THE DIAMINO ACID IN THE CELL WALL PEPTIDOGLYCAN, ARABINOSE AND GALACTOSE AS DIAGNOSTIC SUGARS AND MK-9(H4) AS THE PREDOMINANT ISOPRENOLOGUE. IT ALSO HAS CULTURAL AND MORPHOLOGICAL PROPERTIES CONSISTENT WITH ITS CLASSIFICATION IN THE GENUS, NOTABLY THE FORMATION OF BRANCHING SUBSTRATE HYPHAE WHICH FRAGMENT INTO ROD-LIKE ELEMENTS. 16S RRNA GENE SEQUENCE ANALYSES SHOWED THAT THE STRAIN IS CLOSELY RELATED TO THE TYPE STRAIN OF AMYCOLATOPSIS MEDITERRANEI BUT COULD BE DISTINGUISHED FROM THIS AND OTHER RELATED AMYCOLATOPSIS STRAINS USING A BROAD RANGE OF PHENOTYPIC PROPERTIES. IT WAS SEPARATED READILY FROM THE TYPE STRAIN OF AMYCOLATOPSIS BALHYMYCINA, ITS NEAR PHYLOGENETIC NEIGHBOUR, BASED ON MULTI-LOCUS SEQUENCE DATA, BY LOW AVERAGE NUCLEOTIDE IDENTITY (92.9%) AND IN SILICO DNA/DNA RELATEDNESS VALUES (51.3%) CALCULATED FROM DRAFT GENOME ASSEMBLIES. CONSEQUENTLY, THE STRAIN IS CONSIDERED TO REPRESENT A NOVEL SPECIES OF AMYCOLATOPSIS FOR WHICH THE NAME AMYCOLATOPSIS VASTITATIS SP. NOV. IS PROPOSED. THE TYPE STRAIN IS H5T (=NCIMB 14970T=NRRL B-65279T). 2018, SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG, PART OF SPRINGER NATURE." "AMYCOLATOPSIS VASTITATIS SP.
